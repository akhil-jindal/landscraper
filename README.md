# landscraper - doing the dirty work for intellectual property (IP) decisions

See the [wiki](https://github.com/akhil-jindal/landscraper/wiki) for more information on ___landscraper___ and it's current status in development.

## Introduction

It's difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists that work together and try to answer questions such as:

* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?
  * Patent
  * Trade secret
  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)

* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?
  * Licensors?
  * Competitors?

* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?

* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?

These questions are difficult to answer and require capital and time intensive resources, an require IP decision makers to deeply understand the technology and the state of the art, and avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.

## Objective:

A user can input a sample patent application (i.e., a target patent application) and ___landscraper___ will provide a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' with information such as:
* A patent classification which corresponds to the target patent application
* Identification of 'key players' for your target patent application
