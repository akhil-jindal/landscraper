# landscraper - doing the dirty work for intellectual property (IP) decisions

See the [wiki](https://github.com/akhil-jindal/landscraper/wiki) for more information on ___landscraper___ and its current status in development.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### The Problem:

It's difficult to make intellectual property (IP) decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists
that work together and try to answer questions such as:

* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?
  * Patent
  * Trade secret
  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)

* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?
  * Licensing opportunities?
  * Competitors?
  
* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?

* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?

These questions are difficult to answer and typically require capital and time-intensive resources. In addition, it is required that IP decision makers have a strong understanding of the technology and the current state of the art. Finally, in order to make effective strategic and business decisions, one must avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.

### The Goal:

___landscraper___ provides a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' for a given patent application, by providing information such as:

* Identification of a published patent classification corresponding to the patent application
* Identification of 'key players' (e.g., potential competitors and/or licensees) for the patent application
