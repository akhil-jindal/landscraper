# landscraper - doing the dirty work for intellectual property (IP) decisions

See the [wiki](https://github.com/akhil-jindal/landscraper/wiki) for more information on ___landscraper___ and it's current status in development.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

It's difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists that work together and try to answer questions such as:

* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?
  * Patent
  * Trade secret
  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)

* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?
  * Licensees?
  * Competitors?
  
* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?

* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?

These questions are difficult to answer and typically require capital and time intensive resources. Furthermore, IP decision makers are required to have a strong understand the technology and the corresponding state of the art, as well as avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.

The goal of ___landscraper___ is to provide a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' for a given patent application.  For example:

* Identification of a published patent classification corresponding to the given patent application
* Identification of 'key players' (e.g., potential competitors and/or licensees) for the given target patent application
