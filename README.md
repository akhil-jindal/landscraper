### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

__Problem:__ 

It is difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.

__Types of decisions that need to be made:__

* What intellectual property strategy should we pursue for our technology?
  * Patent
  * Trade secret
  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)

* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?
  * Licensing opportunities?
  * Competitors?
  
* Can we forecast impasses in securing protection and enforceability?

* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?

__What is being done now?:__

* Teams consisting of subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists work together

* Intellectual asset management (IAM) tools and Software as a Service (Saas) can assist with these decisions

__Why is this difficult?__

* Captial and time intensive
* Both the newly developed technology and the field to which it corresponds are dynamic
* We suffer from: analysis paralysis, emotional bias, decision fatigue

__Goal:__

A user can input a sample patent application (i.e., a target patent application) and ___landscraper___ will provide a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' with information such as:
* Classification(s) corresponding to the target patent application
* Top patent publications that are most similar to the target patent application
* Identifies 'key players' for your target patent application
