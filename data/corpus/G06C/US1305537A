it may concern; 
itlmown that I, 'WILLIAM L. Gone nizonni'a subject of the King of Great Britain, residingin; Hartford, in the county of Hartford State of Connecticut, have in: 
"ventcd certain new "and useful Improvements in Combined. Tye Writing-and Computing Machinegofwhich thefollowing is a specinominations. 
' tion, 
The present invention relates to mechani for computin the number of measures or pieces of selecte values or denominations wh' 10h aggregate an amount expressed in' terms of its total number of units. For example, in'selecting currency with which e a payment, it is desirable tohandle as mak few pieces as possible, and therefore it is of advantage ,to know in advance how many pieces of the largest convenient denomination, such as ten dollar bills, can be used, and how many pieces, each, of certain other denominations, such as five and one dollar bills, and smaller silver, 
use, not only in dealing with amounts of our- 'rency of'any character, but also dealing with .any amounts capable :of being measured and expressed interms of'units or multiples of selected denominations. 
 The inven ionis hereinafter illustrated in connection 1 with a combinedl Underwood: 
thisis merely one adaptation of the invenand; that it may be advantageously used in connection wit. other computing machines, or as a machinein itself. 
 In registering amounts it has heretofore been characteristic of computing machines that the amount is registered in the same terms as those in which it is expressed upon the machine; that is to say, $8, for instance, would be re 'stered as $8. By means of the present invention, however, $8 may be regls- -tered as one five dollar:piece'plus three Fons/dollar pieces, or in terms of other de- The invention" therefore involves a'mechanism for receiving a plurality of expressions which amount registered thereon. 
 The mechanism as hereinafter shown, may 
resenting selected measures of diife'rent'deare required in addi :tionthereto. The invention is adaptable to shifting the subtraction position. conjointly represent an linkages and'key. connections shown nominations, two or'more of which may be set by any numeral key to register on the bars thenumber of units, each, of the selec'ted. denominations which make up the amount on the numeral key. When the invention is combined with a typewriter, and the amount to be written has figures in several column positions, the movement of the carriage may be used in a well known way to select the bars on which the settings are to be made; two or more bars being selected for eachcolunin position of the carriage, where the number written in that column is to be expressed in terms of more than one denomination. j 
 In order that the numberv of units or multiples of like denomination obtained from amounts successively written or ex resscd, may be indicated, each bar or cquiva ent device may control a separate accumulator or counter of construction quite similar to that of the accumulators ordinarily used. in 0b taming the sums of typewritten amounts in combined chines. 
The above and typewriting and computing maother features of the inven- Figure l is a view in sectional side elevat on, taken at the line ll of Fig. 2, of an -Underwood-Hanso n combined typewriting and computing machine to which the present improvements are applied, the parts being shown in normal position.

 In the Underwood combined typewriting and computing machine illustrated in the drawings, alphabet keys 1 and numeral keys 2 operate to depress levers 3 to actuate bell cranks 4 and thus swing type-bars 5 upwardly and rearwardly against platen 6, 
which is mounted on carriage 7, driven b v 1 the usual spring barrel 8. Fig. 1. A rack 9 on the carriage meshes with a pinion 10 connected to an escapement wheel 11, which cooperates with carriage feeding dogs 12. The latter are connected to a universal bar 13 operated by the type-bars 5. The platen may be'moved in the usual way between, case positions -by means of a shiftable rail 14 which supports roller 15 carried by the platen frame 16. 
' Pivotally supported'and shiftable to desired computing zone positions along a rail 17 on the carriage are two ta ppets 18 and 19. A tooth on each tappet by engagement with notches at letter-space distance apart on a rail 21, holds the tappets in their'selected positions. Each tappet has a dog 22, which when a tappet is'set, engages and cams up successively each of a number of jacks :23 also set at letter-space distance apart. Except when the machine is to be used for computing purposes, the tappets are below and out of reach of the jacks. \Vhen however, the rollers 24, which serve as cams to lift the tappets and maintain the same in raised position, are swung up by the supporting arms 25 on shaft 26 (see Fig. 3), the dogs '22 are broughtinto the. line with the jacks; and, as the carriage advances, actuate the jacks to depress rods 21- Springs QS-liold the rolls :21 in effective position, and tapered rolls :29 on the tappet-s insure proper and easy cooperation and movement of the tappets and roll; 24. The dogs 22 have free movement in one direction to permit the jacks to pass the same on the return movement of the carriage, and are returned by springs to normal position-when releasedby the jacks on the carriage return movement. The rolls -24 are of sufiicient length to hold the tappets in efi'ective position through the c0mputing zone. Y 
 The jacks 23 and rods 27 (see Fig. 3) are shown as in two sets or series, in each of which their action is similar. The jacks controlled by the tappet 18 are in number equal to the number of decimal columns in the amounts to be written, and are usually nine. 
- The particular machine shown in the drawings, however, is not designed to register or compute in its denominational or .coineindienter or counter section the coins, -etc., of items over 99, 99; and when therefore its denominational section is employed, only four of the jacks controlled by thetappet 18 are of any use. The mechanism set by tappet 18 is that used in the usual adding and subtracting of amounts written. and is for the most part already old in thc'Underwood combined typewriting and computing ,machine. The mechanism set by the tappet 19 concerns the denominational a -cumulators, 
new in the'present' invention, and will be hereinafter described in detail. 
 Each of therods 27 when depressed by the tappet18 rocks one of a series of levers 30 having teeth 31, each to engage and lift one of a series of linkages 32. Each of the linkages 32 has a lug 33 to engage and rock a bell crank 34, and each bell crank 31 when rocked, sets a computing pin rack bar 36 for the column represented by the particular jack actuated, the setting being effected by a slight forward movement of the bar due to the engagementof the bell crank 31 with a I just described. The depression or setting of the pins is effected by means of a series 80 projection-3501i the bar. The bars 36 at their front ends are provided with racks 100 engaging pinions 101- which have pawLandratchet connectionsto dials or computing wheels 102 'having'numbers from *50 t 9. 
, on their peripheries arranged to be exhibited through asight opening in thecasingof the ctnn'puting mechanism; The-linkages32 invert-theorder ef the "jacks and bars, the 
'jacksbeing-successively operated from right to left, and the cor-responding dials being arranged from left to right for proper repres'ent'ation of the amounts.- 
 Computing-pins or.- devices 37,1nin e 1n number,one for each of theninedigits, are -carried1by-each bar 36 in sockets 37, (see Fig. 6) in whichthey have a normally elevated position, but in which they may be depressed so as to protrudebelow the bar in a position determined by the-head 38 of the pin striking a plate 39 on the bar. Theseof depressible linkages i0, nine in number, arranged pin distance apart at right angles above the pin bars, and which, as shown in 1 and 8, are normally out falinement with cross rows of-pins, and can therefore only set pins in the particular bar 36 which has been set forward by itsjack .to bring its pins directly under the linkages. As shownin-Fig. 6, each linkage is comprised of'an upper and a lower reach connected by bell crank levers, and is normally collapsed so that the "lower or pin-striking reach is above-the plane of the pin heads. The pin "barsare held in normal unset position against a plate 44: by means of spring-controlled fingers'l, pivoted at 42 to the frame and bearing against shoulders 43 on the pin I bars. 
 The linkages 40 are operated from the keys 2, and are arranged from front to rear so that in the adding operation the 1 keywill operate the front linkage, the '2 key the next linkage, and so forth; the 9 key operating-the rearmost linkage. The keys "have depending thrust arms 45 which, when the keys are depressed, engage and rock arms id fast, to shafts 47. There is a shaft 47 for each key, and only one certain shaft is rocked by the same key whether the operation be for addition or. subtraction. The shafts 47 are arranged at'right angles to the linkages 40, below the same, and each has also fast thereto a bifurcated arm 48, 
which when the parts are set for adding, 
engages awrist pin .49 on that linkage 40 whose position in the-order of linkages from front to rear,i corresponds.to the key de.- 
pressed. As theshaftATis rocked, on. depression of the key, the, lower. reach fo'f the linkage engaged by it, depresses or sets the pin which has-heen-brought under it,;a1 c l when the key ,isreleased, a suitable spring returns the-linkage and rock shaft and key .to normal position. No linkage .:0; or pm 37 is required for the cipher keybecause no amount. is to .be accumulated-for that key. 
In the machine shown in the drawings, 
digits and the cipher,,always turn in adding direction only. Qonsequently in registering a subtraction, the amount"written cannot as such be transferred. to theidials. The transfer is however-in effect made'by adding, to 'theamount already recordediby the dials, an amount, each column figure ofwhich is the complement of the figure in the corresponding column of the amount to be subtracted, with nine as the base or completenumber instead of ten. In thisoperation the cipher may be considered as complementa'ry to the number nine, and to obtain the correct result oneiunit mustbe added to the complementarynumber recorded in'the 'units or cents column." This assumingbthat theregister shows 00,000,100 and it e desired to subtract 50' therefrom, the operation will proceed as follows: 
Pins must be set up representing 99,999,- 
949. These digits are carried-into their. 
respective computing wheels, making them read 99,999,049. -An additional unit is also added to the,units or left-hand wheel and the carryover then operated',thus making the wheels read '00,000,050, -the "f1 of the previously in the register of course causing a carryover 'onto the thousands wheel. 
 In effecting a subtraction, it is "the'refore necessary, before the amount to be subtracted is written, to change the key connections" to the linkages &0 so that any key operated will setthe pin which represents the numher; complementary to that on the key. It is also necessary first to set all of-the 9 pins so that if no digit key is operated in any particular column, the computing wheel corresponding to that column will nevertheless' have a nine point revolu-tion.- Having set all the 9 pins to meet the contingency of a cipher, orno number, in one or more of the columns, it. becomesinecessary'to -unset the ,9 pin for every column in which any digit is written. The' means for :-accomplishing these various purposes are'not new in the presentinventiom 'but'esince:the denominational computing .mecha nisrne is here illustrated as inter related to-thecoin counting nechanisin which adds: written mechanism during subtracting operations, a 
comparatively full description of'the entire f computing mechanism will assist in a'clear. 
understanding of the invention. 
 Referring to Fig. 5, it will be noted that the rock shafts 47, except the and 9 shafts, in addition to-the arms 48 for engaging those linkages which correspond in position to the number of the key which operates the shaft, also have other bifurcated arms for engagement with wrist pins'on the complementary linkages. On the '5 shaft the a-rm48 can be used to 's'erve'the'purpose of an arm 50; and, as the complement of nine is in effect zero, the 9 shaft needs no complementary connection. In Fig. 5, the setting shown is for subtraction. The shift between adding and subtracting positions is" effected by means of a shaft bar 51 pivoted-at 52 to the frame 53 and engaging alined notches 54C in each of theirock sha'ftsi47, so that when bar 51 is swung, all .the'shafts 47 are moved together longitudinally in their hearings in the frame. For swinging the bar 51, there is attached to it anarm 55 having a pin 56 at outer end'engaged between an arm 57 fixed on shaft 56 and an a'rm'58 loose on c this shaft, these arnisbeing yieldingly connected by a spring '59, and beinglimited in their movement toward each other by a pin 57 on the arm 5.7 and a toe 58 on the arm 58.1Normally arms 57 and 58 will move together with shaft 56 to throw the shifter, 
:but In the event of a jam, to prevent injury, 
"the arm.'58 ma remain behind while the spring 59 stretches. The shaft 56 is rocked from the subtraction key 60 (see Fig. at), 
when the latter is pressed, by means of a push bar 61 connected to an arm 62 fast to I a shaft 63,"to which is also fast a dog 64'for holding the subtraction bar 65 normally for ward against the actions of a spring 66. The subtractionbar has a pin-and-slotengagement with an arm 67 fast to the shaft 56", so that when dog 64 is removed from its notch 68 in the subtraction bar, the spring 66 by throwing the subtraction bar, rocks shaft 56 and causes the linkage conmotions to be shifted to the position shown inFig. 5, in which the complementary linkages are shown in operative connection with a trip 70 normally held by spring 71 in the the keys. 
 The setting of the 9 p1ns is effected when the subtraction bar 1s moved by the spring 66; and, to this end, (see Fig. 14). 
there is pivoted at-69 to the subtraction bar mcnt raar'wardwith'the subtraction bar, it engages and trips an arm 72 fast on a shaft 73 to which a bail 74 is also fast. The bail 74" is thereby caused to strike simultaneously all-of aseries of pin-setting and unsettmg plate 79, which causes the trip to berocked out of engagement with .the bail arm 72, whereupon a coil spring 7 8 returns the latter to normal position, leaving all of the 9" pins'set. When presently the general. 
operator which includes bar 80 is moved forward, and picks up the subtraction bar to return" it to normal position, the spring 71 returns thetrip to the position from which it was-forced by the stop 77. A; toe 72" on lever 72, if-the latter has not been returned by spring 78, will be struck by bar 80 to for:e lever 72 to Fig. 14 position. 
At the time the 9 pins are set connections become effective to provide also for an extra step movement'of the units or cents pin-bearing rack bar and its computing wheei. The extent of movement of the rack bars 'to rotate the associated computing wheels depends upon the particular pins set up thereon, as stated above. These pins are engaged by the cross bar 80 on the general operator 81, which is reciprocated in a manner to be described, so that on its forward motion it engages the. set pins to force or drive the pin-bearing rack bars forward an amountcorresponding to the particular pins set up, and so that on its rearward motion it will return the rack bars by engagement with fixed lugs 82, one of which isprovided on each of the rack bars. 
 As will be seen by reference to Fig. 2, the cross bar 80 of the general operator has a uniformf frontedgeexcept for that portion which comes into engagement with the set pins on the units or cents bar indicated specifically at 83. That is to say, the general operator cross bar 80 has a piece 84 cut out of the frontedge thereof, which piece can at times enter its socket 83, as in a nor-- mal adding operation, so that the units or cents pin-bearing rack bar will be given a movement corresponding to the particular pin set up thereon, with the result that identical pins set up on all bars will cause the general operator to drive their bars identic-ally or, in other words, the front edge of the cut-out portion 84 will come into alinement with the front edge of the body portion of the general operator cross bar 80. 
 For a subtracting operation, however, this cutout portion 84 is located forward with its front edge one step in'advance of the front edge of the general operator cross bar 80, so that it will come into contact with whatever pin happens to be set'on the units or cents bar 85 one step prior to the engagement-with the front edge with'the correspondin'gpin on any of the other pin-bearmg rack bars. -To maintain this forward placement Offthfi' eut-out fportion .84, there is provided a supernumerary bar-86' corre-' sponding to. the other pin-bearing rack bars 36, with the exception that it is unprovided with a rack, inrthat it doesjnotrotate any computin -wheel"-directly,, and is unprovided'w'it Thisgsu'p'ernumerary bar 86', however,- carries the out=out portion 84,- 
softhat'it WiILreciprQcate-With the general operator cross bar .80. v 
 In "the. normal adding operation, the-cut outportion 84 will be overtaken by the gen-- eral :operator cross bar 1 80 before the front edge of the latter-comes into engagement with any of; the set pins on the pin-bearing rack-barsfat which timethe front edge of the cut-out portion 84' will be located in alinementwith'the front edge of'the cross bar 8 0,- sothatT-all the pin-bearing rack bars, will ibe ,givenn 'o'vements corresponding exactly to: the pins set upthereon, At the end- 1 of the forward 'strok'e of the general opera' torcrossbar" 80,-alu'g ('not shown) on the supernumera'ry bar- 86, corresponding-to the lugs '82 thefpin' bearing bars, will be located one step to the rear of the latter, so 
thaton' the return movementiof the latter, the supernum'erarybar .86 and the portion 84*carried' thereby will lag behind the cross bar- 80 one step,'-u ntil the-latter overtakes it, whereby E'when the general operator cross .bar :80;-comes to its home position, the' front edgeof thebut-out portion 84.- will be located one step'jin advance crossbar-180. Y 
 :As stated above; in the subtractingoperation is necessary to. maintain: the cut-out portion "84 in its advanced; position with resp'ect toYthe-general operator cross'bar 8U. 
For thispur pose, when the-9 pins areset by the bai1'74, a trigger 87 pivotally'mounted on the supernumerary bar 86' iszfo rced down "from a raised position out of the, path of the l'g'eneral'op'er'ator cross bar 80,. to 'adepressed position {with ashoulder thereon inthe 'path of the front *edgeof the general operator cross bar 89, bythe engagement of the-9 pin setting'bail 74:" with" an up- 87;"""-The up and down-movements" of t wardly-extending finger 88'. on the trigaer e trigger 87 are limited, respectively,- by lugs seame whibhoverhang theftopfledge of th ii ernumerary-barSG at t pp sides of'the pivot ofthe' trigger 87; 
 It will-'thus-be. seen thatwhenythe 9 pins areset up for subtracting operation, the. trigger 87 will at the same time be-depressed to bring a" shoulder thereon into the path-of the general operator cross bar 80, so that thefront edge ofthescut-out portion 84' carried by supernuinjeiar bari 86,will' be maintained one step inadvance' of theifro'nt of the front edge of the edge of the general operator cross bar :80, whereby it will come into engagement with the partieular pin Whiehhappensto beset up on theunits or cents bar 85. one step in advance of the corresponding engagement ofthel front edge; with a corresponding pin set up on a-nyof the otherpin bearing rack bars36. This, then, givestothe units or eents Wheel a rotation one step in excess of: that which it would receive to correspond; 
with the particular-pinset up 11 its assoc'ij ated rack bar. For example-if Zero were subtracted 1n the cents orjun'its column, then the 9 pin would rem i ithe units or cents-wheel would receiveazrotation not only of nine-stepsbut one step-in ex cess thereof, so that it would be revolved ten steps 'or a complete revolution in :this 'deci; 
mal system, whereby-31? would beicallied This unsetting or restoring connection to some one of thelinkages 2L0, 
also has an arm and wrist pin .con ion and 92 to a linkage93 similar to the linkages 40 but-outside of the rock shaft'ffraine. Ea' ch ofthe 59? pin setting andfunsettinglevers 75, on its-reararm. has an upward projecting lug 9-L which, -;whenthepin bar onqvhi ch' it is mounted is set vforward its jaek; 23, is :broughtunder and in ialinementiwith the linkage '93, so that-if any digitkeyiisthere after operated, the lowerreach Vof,linka-ge 93 is thrown-down against thelever 75,- so'gs'et forward, and rocks ithat ,lever to lift orunset the"-9- pin onthatbarv Each lever 7 5 has also a lower lug 95 Which by strikingthe top of its bar 36limits the vrestoring move-.1

 The amount "having been eitheraddi'tion' or subtraction, the general operator bar '80 is actuated to move forwardthe rack bars- 36, and thus rotate thedialsthe distances corresponding to; settingsof the pins 37. Forthis' purpose the general operator is. provided on each side with fa rack 96.1 Meshing with eachrack 96, is'a. pinion, 97 supported on the machine frame, 
" linkages 40 are set'fo r; addition by a shift of the rock. shafts 47, the latter are ..disconand meshing with each pinion is a segmental 'rack '98, both segmental racks 98 being fast to a cross shaft 99. Also fast to shaft 99' is an arm 103 carrying a handle 104 for rocking shaft 99 backwardly or forwardly to throw the general operator one way or the to each dial wheel, a wheel 105 having ten teeth, having several functions, the principal, 
of which is to give to the dial to which it is attached a teps-carrying movement from the next lower dial. Springdetents 106 engaging wheels 105, hold the dials in true position. 
a detent 107. Thedetents 107 are in the form of levers loosely mounted on a cross shaft 108; and each has, to the rear of shaft 108, a tooth 109. Extending over all of the teeth 109,'but held normally out of engagement with the latter by meansof a spring 113, is a bar or bail 110 supported on arms 111 fast to a shaft 112. Also fast to shaft 112 is an arm 114 which, during the movement of the general operator, is held by the spring 113 against a bar 115 secured to the left hand side of the general operator. Bar 115 is turned up at 116 to serve asa cam for rocking the arm 114, and with it the shaft 112 and bar 110, when the general operator, at the end of its forward movement, brings the upturned part 116 to the lever 114,; thus causing the bar 110 to strike the teeth 109 and force the detents 107 between the teeth, 
of the wheels 1055, locking the latter against .overthrow. Until locked by the bar 1 10, 
thejdetents 107 vibrate freely over the teeth of the wheels 105 as the general operator moves forwardly. 
 The tens-carrying movement from one dial to the next higher is effected on the return of the general operator as follows. 
A One of the-racks 96 on thegenera-l operator meshes with a pinion 117 which is loosely mounted on a stud on the machine frame and which also meshes with a pinion 118 having'aball and clutch connection 120 to a shaft 119, -to drive the latter-only on the return movement of the general operator. Fast to shaft 119 are disks 121, one for each dial, andeach having a tooth 122 to mesh with one of a number of mutilated gears 123 loose'ona countershaft 124. Each gear 123 has every third. tooth missing so that unless the gear is properly set, it cannotbe reached To prevent overthrow of the dials by the racks 100, each wheel 105 is also engaged-by and moved by the toothed disk 121 opposed thereto; The return movement of the general operator efi'ects one complete revolution of shaft 119, and consequently of all the disks 121. If therefore any gear 123 is set for engagement with its actuating tooth on the opposing disk, the gear is given a partial rotation, which will cause one of three teeth on a disk 126, attached to the gear, to engage and advance one step, the opposing wheel 105 of one of the dials, thus causing that dial to register an increase of one which is a carry overof ten from the next lower dial. f 
' Until ten is to be carried over from any dial the gear 123 for that dial is in Fig. 1 position and cannot be moved by its disk I 121. Each: dial, however, has one tooth 127 on its periphery, which'after' a nine point movement of the dial by its pin bar, engages, 851 and gives one-ninth of a revolution to the opposing gear 123, thus bringing-a-tooth of the latter into position to be-engaged, onreturn of the general operator, by the tooth 122 on theiopposing' disk 121, which latterg'zo as above stated, gives the gear 123 a further movement sufficient to register, an increaseone on the next higher dial. The disks 121 are cutaway in front of the teeth 122. Undesired movement of gears 123, which have not been set, or which having beenset have been moved the requisite distance on return movement of the carriage, is prevented when the uncut portions of i the peripheries of the disks 121 enter the spaces where the teeth are missing on the gears. Tens-carrying movements may be given to several dials during the same return movement of the general operator, and inorder: 
that the tens-carrying maybe progressive from lower to higher denominations, the teeth 122011 the disks 121 are arran ed spirally around the shaft 119, whereby t ey come into action successively instead of si-' multaneously. 
 When thegeneral operator starts its return movement, the bar 110, and with it the I detent levers 107, which have locked the .dials against overthrow, are releasedto permit' ofthe tens-carrymg operation justdescribed. Itis however, desirable to assure the dials against o\'*erthrow also inthe tens- -carrying operation, and for this purpose the detent levers 107 have arm's 130 terminating in cam surfaces. 131 for engagement with segments'13'2, fast to shaft 119, and arranged spirally around the shaft, so that after any tooth 122 on a disk has completed a tens carrying movement-of a dial, the proper segment strikesthe cam surface 131 ofrt-he de 125 tent levers with which it cooperates, thereby rocking that lever to throw it into locking engagement with the wheel 105 of that dial, and temporarily holding it in such locking engagement. The forward and backward movements of the general operator are limlatter, when the same have previously been 1 set for subtraction by operation .of the subtractionkey. ,This is accomplished at or near the end .of the forwardniovement of the operati'onby means-of alug 137 (see Fig. 9-) on the subtraction bar inthe ath; of'the operator-bar 80.

that they'will be ready to. accumulate a subsequent computation; For this purpose, there is provided on {the general operator, a pawl 138 which is pivoted so: asto swing idly past an arml39- on a. rockrshaft 140 during the forward motion ofthe "general operator; A spring 141 however, returns this pawl 138 to its normal position, so that on the return stroke of the generaloperator, the pawl- 138 L pins37; 'llhepin-restoring plate 1.43 is. sup

It has een pointed out that 1n thepar-I- ticu'lar embodiment of the invention-shown '105 in the drawings'the denominational compute;

indicators, isdesigned-to accumulate the, def; nominational elements, as represented coins, of items not .greater than-$99.99, a1idI110 that therefore no single itemgreater. than;- that'shou'ld be written when the coin in Y catin device is used; An amount suchas this, aving but four column positions, calls for-the use of but four of the acks 23- coneg l trolled by the. tappet 18, and likewisefo but four jacks of corresponding columnpo-j sitions, controlled by the tap-pet 19'. .jSince any number Written in the lefthand or tens the ten dollar piece (viz., coin or'bill yjist illustration of the invention, the numzbei o t ten dollar bills called for when that .digit is 2 written is naturally the value of the==digit 5 written and registered in the tens of dollarscolumn. Consequently the $10 bar 151- may 'be abar having nine pins, 158 representing respectlvely the nine digits, arranged and 1 mounted exactly asin the case of the bar 180 1 without the five dollar .36, so that, when the bar 36 for that column is moved forwardly by the general operator to register the amount of the digit, the bar .151 may be moved the same distance to reg 19 for that column, should set only the out one fifty-cent piece. 
$5 bar 152 but also the $1 bar 153. 
 In the following or third column from the left, the digit for which the corresponding pin bar 36 is'set, calls for the registration of one, two, three or four dimes, with or withg The jack 23 controlled =by tappet 19 for this column should therefore set not only the bar 154 but also the 10 bar 155. i 
In" the last or cents whim; any digit pin set upon the corresponding column pin bar 36 calls for one, tw'o,'three "four "one cent pieces wit-li'or' without one five-cent piece. The jack 23 controlled by the tappet- 19 for the last column therefore sets both the 5 bar 156 and the l 'bar 157. Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, it will be seen that. the jacks controlled by tappet 19 connect by means of links 27 with levers 160, 
 each ofwhich operates one of the four linkages 161, 162,163and'164rsim-ilar to the linkages32. The linkage 161 has one lug 165 engaging one arm of a bell crank 166, the other arm of which engages a projection 167 on the $10 bar 151, so that when the linkage is actuated by its acks, it operates to set forward the bar 151 in the same maner that the pin bars 36 are set forward. inkage 162 has two lugs168-and 169, the firstfof which engages a "bell. crank 170 to set the $5 bar 152, and the second of which engages a bell crank 171 to set the $1 bar 153. ;Linkage 163 has two lugs 172 and 173 for operating bell cranks 174 and 175 to set the 50 bar 154 and the 10 bar 155 respectively, and linkage 164 also has two lugs 176 and 177 to operate bell cranks 178 and 179 to set 5 bar 156 and 1 bar 157 respectively. 
The linkages40 (see Figs. 6, 10, 11, 12 and 13) which set the pins 37 are continued over the bars 151 to 157 inclusive, and also serve to set the pins, or their equivalents, on such of these bars as may have been set forward by their acks, it beingmnderstood that the normal or unset position of these bars is such that the pins or equivalents thereof are normally out of alinement with the linkages 40, as in the case of the bars 36. 
The $10 bar 151 has nine pins 158 thereon amount $67.89. 
mounted in the same manner as the pins 37, representlng multiples of ten to be registered, according to the digit written in the tens column when one of the number keys 2 is operated. As 'to the $5 bar 152, it has been pointed out that not more than one five-dollar piece can be registered, whatever the digit written for that column. 
,same is true of the bars 154 and 146, for 
registering 50 and 5e pieces, respectively, 
and since these three bars may therefore beidentical in structure, a ,description of bar 152 will sufice for all three. 
 The bar (see Fig. 7) has pivoted thereto at 181, a trigger 182 having thereon, in the 1 pin position, a lug 183normally held-out of the path of the operator bar 80. Projecting upwardly from the trigger, in the 5 pin position, is a finger 184. When bar 152 is set forward by its jack, finger 184 is brought-under the 5 linkage 40, and when the latter is depressed, inthe adding operation, it strikes finger 184, rocking the trigger to throw the lug 183 into the path of the operator bar 80. Finger 184 is turned the trigger 182 from the 5 key 2 is therefore apparent. Its setting from the 6, 7, 8 and 9 keys 2 is by means of cross connections between certain of the linkages 40, presently to be described. 
 The bars 153, 155 and 157, which are for registering one dollar pieces, dimes and onecent pieces, being operable in conjunction with the bars 152, 154 and 156 require but four-pins 185 in the 1," 2, 3 and 4 pin positions. These pins'however, in addition to being operable from the 1, 2, 
3 and 4 keys 2 respectively, for regis tering amounts of one,.two, three or four, 
must also be operable, respectively, from the 6, 7, 8.and 9keys 2, to register the one, two, three or four needed in addition to one five when one of these latter keys 2 is depressed. 
The cross connections between the linkages 40, for use in the denominational section of the machine, will now be explained, 
reference being had to Figs. 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 
5-- same distance with the general opera-tor. 
 When the carriage moves on one letter- 'sp'ace the jacks 23 for the next succeeding -column are operated and set forward the :proper column pin bar 36 and the'bars 152 and an arm 198 adapted to engage .wrist pin 199 on the 3 linkage l; and (see Fig. 13) the 9 rock shaft 47 having an arm 200 adapted to engage a wrist pin 201 on the 5 linkage, and an arm 202 adapted to engage wrist pin 203 on the 4: linkage 4:0. Returning now to the example $67.89, of 
 i "cross connections hereinafter explained be-' which the registering of 6 and 7 has been explained, the typewriter carriage, when in the dimes column, sets forward'the rack bars 154;.and 155, with the result that the actuation of the 8 key sets the trigger 182 on the rack 1 to represent one fiftycent piece, and at the same time the said 8 key sets the one of the pins 185 which represents three dimes on the rack bar 155. Analogously at the next or cents column, the typewriter carriage sets forward the rack bars 156 and .157, so that the actuation of the 9 key sets the trigger 182 on the rack bar 156 and the pin representing four cents onthe rack bar 157. 
 When the 5 key 2 is operated, as heretofore explained, no cross connections between linkages 410 are required, since the trigger 182 sets the lug 183 for registration of one in the $5, 50, or 5 accumulators, Laccordingto the column in which 5 is written. When any key 2 for a digit lower than five, is operated, no cross connections between linkages 40 are needed. Each linkage 40 sets its'respective pin 87 on the pin bar 36, andalso the corresponding pin 185 1. ?'an d '153. If new the 6 key 2 is depressedbf f the'operative (ignoringfor the moment the'exa'mple given above), not only will the '---.6 linkage 10 be operated to set the 6 ---'pin-(' n the pin 'bar 36 for registration of 1 ;-si-X on. theproper dial 102, but also the 5' "linkage 40 should be operated to set lug 183 on her 152 for the registering of one '-'=$5 piece in the $5 accumulator, and the 1 i *linkage 4O should be operated to set the 1 pin on the $1 bar 153 for registration of $1 onlithefil accumulator. It will be noted -gthat lif 6; 5 and 1'li-nkages are thus -operated, then in addition to the 6 pin, 5''-and 1 pins will incidentally be eaten the pin bar 36 which has been set forwardfbutthe highest, 01"6, pi-n will be j thonly 'eflective pin set on that bar, be han e-it :is the pin which will be engaged ibfy'f tlie operator bar '80. The same holds tri1e-a's to the bar 151 which will have set thereon a pin representing the digit on the --key 2 depressed, although, by reason of ".tween' the linkages 40, other ins will be 35 set on that. bar. In order that under these on the bar 153, 155 and 15 circunistances, the 6 key 2 may operate When the general operator is drawn fornot only the 6 linkage, but also the 5 Ward to complete a computation after the .-a. nd 1 linkages, itwill be seen on referencesettings have been made, it drives the bars 7 f i-Fig'. 10, that 6 rock shaft. 47 18 pro- 151 to 15-7 inclusive, to accumulate or add .40 vided with an arm 188 adapted to engage, in their respective registers or counters acwhen the parts are set for addition, a wrist cording to'the settings.

diifer. .fromthe addingwregister or accumulator which hasthe dials.102,.main'ly in that. 
in the latter each dial 102 is adapted to be separately driven from a pin bar 36, whereas in the denominational registers only the right-hand dial 150 ofeach register is driven from a bar; all movements of the other dials 150 in each register being simply tens-carryin'g movements, this being so, because never more than nine units of coins or money are added at once. v I 
 1 When the general operator bar 80 returns, it strikesshoulders 8201i eachwof the, bars 151 to 157 and carries these bars back to normal position where they are held by spring fingers 41 (see Fig. 7) against the plate 4 1, which. also has grooves at .41, to serve as. guides for the bars. On the return movement of the operator all pins. 158 and triggers 182 on the bars l5l to 157 are unset and returned to normal position by plates 143, similarto and which may be integral with the plate 143 under the pin bars 36, 
each lifted by an arm 142 fast to shaft-1 10, which .is rocked by, the trip 138. Bell cranks 144 and link .145, already mentioned, maintain the plates horizontal. A spring detent .206 (see Fig. 7 attached toeach of. the bars 152, 154 and 156, by engagement with a notch 20.? in the trigger 182 on that bar, 
"holds the trigge in place wheni't is depressed, and, byen'gagem'ent with a second m te}; 208 in the trigger, holds the-latter in place when elevated. A bent finger 209 .on 
the trigger, by striking the top of the bar determlnes the upward throw of thetriggei'. It will be noted as one of the advantages of the present. invention that it proyides means whereby a pay roll can be written out on the typewriter, and the pay items thereof be accumulated or added without interferpaper) on both simultaneously. The present invention therefore furnishes a check on the work of the payroll clerk,'and at'the same time enables him to locate his own errors rapidly, because if an error has been made in filling the pay envelops, there will beeither a shortage or .a suplus of'sonie one of the'coins or bills. The operative may prove the accuracy of transcribing the total by subtracting it out of the register in the usual way, andthen the coin registers may be brought to zero,"after having made a .memorandum of the numbers shown thereon. 
. It has been stated that in the machine as shown in the drawings, the denominational registers are not designed to be operated when subtraction is being performed. They are therefore rendered inoperative by the following means. East to the shaft 56?; 
which is rocked to shift the linkages 40 from adding to subtracting position when the subtraction key is'pressed, are two arms 210 and 211 from which depend link 212 and 213, on the lower ends of which a bar 211 is carried. Each of the bars 151-to 157 inclusire, is held at, its shoulder 82 to the bar 214- by a hook 215, so that when shaft 56 is rocked to effect the shift for subtraction. the bars 151 to 157 are all swung upwardly from ,Fig. 7 to Fig. 8 position, a distance sufficient to takethe pro ections 167 out of reach of the bell cranks 170, etc., by which theyfare set from the jacks 23. The jacks 23 therefore become ineffective to set the denominational bars when the machine is set for sub.- 
 traction. When the general operator,. .t ward the. end' of its forward stroke, returns the subtraction bar to normal position, and thus, through the arm 67, rocks shaft 56fbo shift the linkages 40 again to adding posi' tion, it again-depresses the bar 211 and. by 
reason of the hooks 215, alsothe bars 151 to 157, so that the denominational'or' coin counting mechanism is again effective. 
 Inca-Se of error, any settings of the pins on the bars 36 and bars 151 to "l57'inclusive, may be" erased at wil1,'before the general operator is actuated, by means of an error key 220 (see Fig. '15). This key is held in norm'al position by .a spring 221, and is returned to normal position by this spring .after each depression,
