OSCAR J. SUNDSTRAND, 0F ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS, ASSIGNOR, BY MESNE ASSIGNMENTS, TO SUNDSTRAND CORPORATION, OF WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, A CORPORATION OF DELAWARE ADDING AND RECORDING MACHINE. 
Application filed' June 16, 1924, Serial No. 720,187.A Renewed November 5, 1928. 
 This invention relates to adding and recording machines of the type wherein two totalizers are provided to receive items of two different classes, as, for example, debits and credits. Such a machine may be used to list items of different classes in a single column or in separate columns. 
 The object of the invention, generally stated, is to providea very simple and efiicient machine of the type indicated.l 
 A special object is to adapt a machine of the Sundstrand type to the registration and recording of items of two different classes. 
 ,In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a fragmental longitudinal vertical sectional view of an adding and recording machine embodying the features of my invention. The machine is shown at restpand in adjustmenttoA accumulate items in the4 rear or debit totalizer. Fig. 2 is a View of the keyboard of the machine. Fig. V3'is a detail view of the means forpreventing casual rotation of the pinions while out of mesh with the racks, both totalizers being shown out of mesh with the racks. Fig. 4 is a fragment-al right-hand side view, the part-s being shown in the same position as in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 is a fragmental end elevation looking from the right-hand side of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a. detail view of the element 269. Fig. 7 is a detail View of the element 235. Fig. 8 is a fragmental right-hand side elevation. The total key 221 is shown depressed, the handle 27 is on its return stroke, and the pinions have just been n fithdrawn from the racks. The lpart 257 has prevented the pawl 158 from engaging the pin 163. Fig. 9 is a detail view ofthe member 2,42. Fig. 1 is a view illustrating the means for raising and lowering the type bars, the parts being shown in the initial or rest position. Fig. 11 is a right-hand side view showing a portion of the means for obtaining totals, the parts beingr shown in the position assumed when there is no item set up in the machine, and the position assumed after a spacing stroke of the handle has been taken. Fig.' 12 is a sectional detail view. Fig. 13 is a frag mental view illustrating the means for throwing the totalizers into and out of operation, the rear or debit totalizer being shown in operative relation to its actuating racks. It may be assumed in Fig. 13 that the racks are about to descend to add a debit item. Fig. 14 is another view of the means for C throwing the totalizers into and out of action, the forward or credit -totalizer being shown in operative relation to its actuating racks in Fig. 14, the handle has started to return to initial position, and the racks are c about to descendv to add a credit item. Fig. 15 isI a detail View of one of the plates by means of which the totalizers are movably. supported. Fig. 16 isa detail view of the element 142. 'Fig 17 is a detail View of f the cam plate 190. Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate the action of the carrying mechanism. In Fig. 18one of the debit racks 130 y'has been released so as to cause carrying from one order to the next highei. In Fig. 19, one of 1 the credit racks 131 has been permitted t0 descend to effect carrying from one order to the next higher. Fig. 20 is a fragmental perspective View of one of the .parts of the carrying mechanism. Fig. 21 is a horizontal 1 sectional View of the totalizers-and related par-ts in the position occupied during the forward stroke of the operating handle when accumulating `and 'the "return `stroke of the handle during a clearing operation. Figs. i 22, 23, 24 and 25 are facsuniles of work done on the machine. 
 Although the invention is herein shown as embodied in a machine of the ten-ke type such as is disclosed in the Sundstrand atent z N o. 1,198,487, certain features thereof 'are not limited to use in machines of that character. 
 The sheet or tape o'n which the'items and totals are to be printed and the calculations 1 recorded may be supported in any ordinary or suitable Wa. In the present instance, a cylindrical platen 2 is employed. In the machine'her'ein shown, the printing is effected by means of vertically reciprocatory t e 1 bars 3, one such bar being provided for eac numerical order. The machine herein illustrated is adapted to register and print upto 9,999,999.99, hence nine bars3are employed, as 'will be understood from Fig. 21. Said I bars are arrangedcompactly side by side, and they are guided near their upper ends by means of a transverse bar 5 Xed in the framework of .the machine, said bar extending through vertically elongated o enings 6 in the type bars. The lower ends o the type bars are located between and guided by two transverse fixed bars 7 and 8, the latter being slotted to receive the rear edges of the type bars. D 
 Eachtype bar 3 is provided at its upper end with ten type 9 adapted to print from naught to nine, respectively.A The upper: most type is adapted to print 0,7 the next to the top 1, and so on. 
 In the present machine the means for vertically moving each bar 3 into and out of printing position comprises n n arm 10 carr v ing a headed stud that lies in an elongated opening 11 in the type bar. Theharm 10 is loosely mounted on a shaft 12 which is supported in the framework of the machine. Rigid with the arm 10 is an arm 13 which is yieldingly connected through two hellcally coiled contractile springs 14 to a rod 15. The latter is carried by two side members 16 (Fig. 1) which are guided for approximately vertical movement by 'a transverse rod fixed in the framework of the machine, sald rod extending through elongated openings 18 in the side members 16. Pivoted to the upper ends of the. side members 16 are two levers 19 (Fig. 4) which are mounted in the framework of the machine to swing on the axis 19a. are pivoted links 23 (Figs. 1 and 4) the forward ends of which are pivoted to two crank arms 24 and 25 fixed to opposite ends of the main rock shaft 26. The shaft 26 isn'arf ranged to be rocked by means of a handle or crank 27 mounted to swing upon the axis 28. The connection between the handle 27 and the arm 24 may be of any suitable character, as, for example, a link 27al (Fig. 10) connected to a crank arm 27" arranged to swing with the handle. understood that an electric motor may be used to rock the shaft 26, if desired. 
 When the operator pulls the handle 27 forward, the crank arms 24 andl 25 swing upwardly, thereby drawing the lower ends of the levers 19 forwardly and moving the side members 16 and the rod 15 downwardly. rlhe movement of the rod 15 is yieldingly transmitted through the springs 14 and the arms 13 and 10 to such of the bars 3 as are at liberty to rise. When the operator releases the handle upon the completion of the forward stroke, the handle is returned to its normal position (shown in dottedlines in Fig. 1) by a contractile spring 28a (Figs. 5 and 10) connected at one end to the righthand lever 19 and at its other end to an arm 28b fixed to the shaft 26. 
 The means for positively moving down those type bars 3 which were raised in the forward stroke of the handle comprises a transverse -rod 29 (Figs. l and 5) overlying the forward portions of the arms 10. For a complete disclosure of said means reference may be had to my application Serial To the lowerends of the levers 19Y It will of course be vthe rearward stroke of the handle 27 the restoring rod 29 is drawn downwardl in proper time relation to the operation o f the printing mechanism, thus pushing down those type. bars 3 that were raised to print an item or a total. p 
 The means herein shown for limiting. the extent to which the type bars 3 may rise, and thus to determine which numerals shall be brought to the printing position, comprises a stationary group of stops 42 (Fig. 1) similarto those employed in the Sundstrand adding machine. For a disclosure of the stop mechanism reference may be made to the Sundstrand Patent No. 1,198,- 487 and to my -application Serial` No. 409,- 778, tiled September 1.3, 1920 (now Patent No. 1,583,102, dated May 4, 1926). It will here be suflicient to say that each stop is horizontally slidable in a forward and back direction, there being one vertical row or column of nine stops for each numerical order. When moved rearwardly from the po sition shown in Fig. 1, the stops are in the -path of movement of devices carried by the type bars 3 and thereby limit. the upward movement of said bars. These devices consist of arms 45 pivoted to the lower portions of the typebars 3, and pins 46 having openings through Which the arms 45 extend. The pins 46 are guided for vertical movement in a slide 47 which is mounted on a stationary guide rod 48 extending transverselyof the machine. The guide rod 48 is so positioned with reference vto the group of stops 42 that the slide 47 is movable to carry the pins 46 from their normal or initial position at the left-hand side of thegroup of stops 42 into vertical alinement with the columns of stops. 
 The type bars 3 are normally about one step below the cipher-printing position, a slight movement being necessar7 to raise the pins 46 against the naught stops 42 or the detent plate 48a described in Patent No. 1,198,487. When a bar 3 is raised until its pin 46 stops against a projected stop 42'in the second horizontal row from the bottom, said bar is in position to print the numeral 1. The stops -42 in the third row from the bottom serve to position the type bars for the printing of the numeral 2, and so on. As'fully disclosed in said Patent No. 1,198,487, those type bars 3 which are not needed 1n printing algiven item are prevented from rising when the handle is pulled forward, by the detent plate 4S (Fig. 11) guided to move in a horizontal plane, said plate being connected through a bar 48b to a rigid frame 48. The frame 48c is mounted to swing on the axis of the bar 5 and is normally impelled forward bv contractileA springs 48d, only one of which ius shownin the present drawings. When the slide 47 is in the initial position (that is to lll) say, at the left-hand side of the machine) the detent plate `48a is out of the vertical plane of the pins 46. As soon as the slide moves one step to the right the detent plate 48a is moved hack far enough to overlie all the pins 46 except the one farthest to the right, as explained in my said Patent No. 1,583,102. 
 The means .for projecting the stops 42 into the path of the pins 46 eomprisesten keys 49 which are numbered from 0" to 9, as shown in Fig. 2. The means whereby movement of the numeral keys 49 is transmit-ted to the stops 42 may he of any suitable character, as, for example, that discloL-ed in said Sundstrand Patent No. 1,198,487 or that shown in my said Patent No. 1,583,102. 
 The repeat or multiplying key 84 (Fig. 2) may be constructed and arranged in the manner fully disclosed in said Sunstrand Patent' No. 1,198,487. 
 In case the operator, when setting up an item, should strike a wrong numeral key. he may correct the error by operating the back spacer key 86 (Fig. 2) to restore the slide 47 to the position occupied just before the error occurred. The back spacer key 86 may he connected to the slide 47 as in Patent No. 1,198,487. The back spacer key may also be employed when it is desired to set the slide 47 for the printing of a number one-tenth that of the num-.ber previously set' up. 
 The calculating mechanism comprises two series of pinions 125 and 125 (Figs. 18 and 19), each series being rotatably mounted upon a transverse shaft 126. For convenience, the rear series .of pinions 125 will be herein termed the debit totalizer. and the forward series of pinions 125 the credit totalizer. There are as many pinions in each totalizer as there are type bars 3. The shafts 126 are supported for sliding movement longitudinally of the machine. For this purpose the ends of the shafts 126 are carried by two parallel plates 127 (Figs. 15 and 21). The ends of said plates have slots 128 to receive two transverse guide bars 129 which are rigidly secured to the stationary framework of the machine. The totalizers are located between two sets of racks 130 and 131 which are connected to the type bars 3. 
 Addition of debit items is accomplished by means of the rear totalizer andthe set of racks 130. When a debit item is Ato be added, the plates 127 are moved to place both totalizers out of mesh with the'racks before the type bars 3 are raised; and are moved rearwardly to place therearftotalizer in mesh with the racks '130 justbeforethe bars 3 are moved downwardly. Addition` of. debititems therefore occurs in the down. 
 stroke of the racks 130, the extent of rota- `tion of the 'pinions depending, of course, 
upon the extent of movement of. the type bars 3 and racks 130. 
 Addition of credit items is effected by means of the front totalizer and the set of racks 131. When a credit item is to be added, the' plates 127 are moved to place both totalizers out of mesh with the racks before the type bars 3 are elevated; and are moved forward to place the front totalizer in mesh with the racks 131 justbefore the type hars 3 descend. Addition of credit items consequent-ly takes place in the down stroke of the racks 131. 
 The upper end of each rack is attached to a rearwardly extending portion 132 (Fig. 18) of one of the type bars 3 by means o a headed pin or stud 133 extending through a vertically elongated opening 134 in the rack. A contractile spring 135 attached at its upper end to the rack at 136 and at its lower end to a downwardly-extending portion 137 of the type bar tends to move the rack downwardly with relation to the type bar one tooth space for carrying purposes. The backs of the racks slide in grooves 138 (Fig. 20) in the stationary guide bars 129. 
The part 136 of the rackbeing virtually' al short lever arm, the spring 135 tends to turn' the rack on the stud 133as a pivot,and thus serves to holl the rack in place in its 'guide groove 138. However, in order to prevent the rack frombeing pulled out` of place in case the pinion 'teeth should stick thereto when the pinion is being moved toward neutral position, I provide a bar 139 fixed in the framework and extending adjacent to and transversely of the racks. Normally. there is'clearance between the racks. and the bars 139. 
 The guide ba'rs 129 are. located close to the point of -tangency of the racksl to the pinions, and hence serve elect-ively to guide thc racks. Even i the racks were slightly bent or bowed, or if'there were a tendency to move in a non-rectilinear path, they would be compelled to reciprocate in proper relation to the pinions. 
 The totalizers are moved into and out of mesh with the racks 130 and 131 by means of two links 140 (Figs. 14 and 21), one at each side of the machine, the forward ends of which are connected to the plates 127 by means of pivots 140% The rear ends of the links. 140 are pivoted ,at 141 to the lower arms oftwo 1evers 142 (Figs. 14 and 16) which are rigidly secured to a. shaft 143 (Fig. 21) that is journalled in the framework of the machine. l 
 The means forV swinging the levers v142 to move the pinions into and out of mesh with therackscomprises a link 144 (Fig.- 14), the forward end of which is supported by a lever 145 pivoted on arod 146. The rear. 
yis moved forward and back by meansof an oscillatory cam plate 153 having a cani slot 154 therein, the upper portion of .said slot being concentric with the axis 155 of said plate. On the forward end of the link 144 is a roller 156 that lies in the slot 154. A 
contractile spring 157 (Fig. 8) connected to the lever 145 and anchored to the machine frame holds the roller 156 against the front wall of the cam slot 154 and thus takes up play. The tension of thc spring overcomes the weight of the cam 153 and the link 144, and thus prevents the weight of these parts from causing the totalizers to move out of neutral position. 
 The means for oscillating the cam 153 coniprises a pawl 158 (Fig. 14) which is pivoted at 159 upon a plate 16() which is rigidly secured to the a'rm 24. A contractile .spring 161 (Fig. 8) is connected at one cud to an extension of the pawl 158 and at its other end to the plate 160. The pawl 158 has a shoulder 158 (Fig. 11) adapted to-cngage a pin 162 11) set in the 'cam 153 at one side of its axis 155, and another shoulder 158b adapted to engage a pin, 163 fixed Ain the cam 153 at the opposite side of its axis. There is a guide finger 164 on the pawl'bctween the shoulders referred to, said guide linger extending into the space between the pins 162 and 163 so as to strike said-pins as the arm 24 swings, whereby 'the pawl is swung to one side or the other of its pivot. The spring 161 tends to swing the pawl into central position. Under certain conditions the pawl 158 engages the pin 162 whenthe handle 27 is pulled forward, therebyswingingr thecam 153 upwardly and drawing the link 144 forward, thus operating the levers 142 and consequentlyv shifting the totalizers; and when the handle swings rearwardly, the pawl 158 engages the pin 163 and swings the cam 153 downwardly, thus pushing the link l44rearwardly, with a resultant'shifting of the totalizers. 
 Referring now to the means for determining Which totalizer shall be placed in engagement with its racks: When'the machine is clear, the link 144 is in engagement with Fig. 14. It will be seen that the link 144 is reciprocable in two different planes. The means for shifting the link 144 from o ne plane to another comprises a lever 165 (Fig, 1t) pivoted at 166 in the machine frame and having a 'forked rear end which engages a pin 167 on the link 144. The lever 165 has a downwardly-extending arm 168 to which is attached a contractile spring 169 that serves to raise the lever 165 and hence the llink 144. The spring 169 is controlled by means including a credit key 170 having a stem 171 which is guided for vertical movement. A contractile spring 172 normally hol-ds the credit key elevated. On the stem 171 is a pin 173 that overlies a forwardly extending arin 174 pivoted at 175. Rigid with the arm 174 is a downwardly extending arm 17 6. A contractile spring 177 connected to the arm 176 tends to draw said arm forward. Then the credit key is depressed, the arm 176 is locked against actuation by the spring 177,by means of a finger 178 fixed to one end of a rock shaft 179 and adapted to overlie the arm 174. Said shaft is arranged to lie operated to release the arm 174 in the manner disclosed in said application Serial No. 670,665. The finger 178 also serves to lock the credit key down, there being a hook 18() (F ig. 14) rigid with the arms 174 and 176 which is adapted to engage a pin 181 on the stem 171. 
 To the` lowerend of the arm 176 is pivotcd a link 182 which has a lost-motion connection with the arm 168 consisting of a headed stud 183 on the arm 168 extending through an elongated hole 184 in the link. The contractile springr 169 is anchored to the link 182, as shown in Fig. 4. 
 Assuming that the machine is clear, or that one or more debitA items have just been accumulated, the link 144 will be in engagement with. the lower pin 150, as shown in Fig. 13. If a credit item is to be registered, the credit key 170 is depressed after the credit item has been set up, thereby pushing thelink 182 rearwardly and thus moving the rear end wall of the opening 184 away from the stud 183. When the handle 27 is pulled, the link 144 is drawn forward, as before eX- plained, to withdraw the pinions 125 from the racks'130 before the racks rise. The forward movement of the link 144 causes the lever 142 toprock, as a result of which the pin 149 is brought into register with the notch '1.47. Thereupon the spring 169 draws the arm 168 rearwardly, thus placing the' notch 147 in engagement with the pin 149. In the return stroke of the handle (Fig. 14)', the link 144 is pushed rearwardly, thereby rocking the lever 142 in the direction to place the pinions 125a in mesh with the'racks 131 before the latter start down. ,The upper portion of the vslot 154 in the cam 153 is a. 
dwell, consequently the return of the handle 130 27 to its initial position leaves the pinions 125 in mesh with the racks 131. The notch 147 also remains in engagement with the pin 149, inasmuch as the link 144 rests upon the pin 150. The credit key 170 is released through automatic operation of the rock shaft 179. `The release of the arm 174 by the linger 178 allows the spring 177 .to turn the threearin lever 174-176-181 far enough to release the credit key 170, the action of the spring being limited by engage? ment of the rear end wall of the opening 184 with the stud 183. 
 lf the'next item to be added be a debit item, the notch 148 is placed in engagement with the pin 150 in the following manner: In the forward stroke of the handle, the link 144 is drawn forward to place the totalizers in central position before the racks ascend. As soon as the pin 150 comes into register with the notch 148, the spring 177 pulls the link 1'82 forward, the rear end wall of the opening 184 causing the arm 168 also to move forward, and thereby lowering the link 144 so as to place the notch 148 in engagement with the pin 150. It will, of course, he levident that the weight of the link 144 and the lever 165 assists to cause engagement of the notch 148 with the pin 150. In the return stroke of the handle, the link 144 is pushed rearwardly by the cam 153,'whereby the lever 142 is swung in the direction to place the pinicns 125 in mesh with the racks 130 before the racks descend. 
 It will be notedthat the link 144is shifted into and out of engagement with the pins 149 and 15() when the totalizers are in central position, that is to say, out of mesh with the racks. 
 To prevent casual rotation of the pinions while they are out of mesh with the racks, I provide for each totalizer a bar 185 (Fig. 14) extending longitudinally of theseries of pinions .and adapted to enter between the teeth thereof. Said bar isrigid with two arms 186 which are pivoted on thevplates 127 at 187 (Fig. 15). At the freev ends of the arms 186 are pins 188 (Fig. 8) vwhich lie in cam slots 189 (Fig, 17) in two cams 190 pivoted at 191 in the stationary frameworkot' the machine. The cam slot 1 89 in each cam 190 is below the pi-vot 191. Above the pivot is a notch 192 to receive the .projecting end of the studs 140aA by means which the links 140 are connected to the plates 127. Upon reference' to Fig. 3, it will beV observed that when the pini'ons are out of mesh with both sets of-racks, the pins 188 are in the central dwell portions ofthe slots 189, anfl'thatY upon movement of the pinions. 'in either direction,- the cams 190 will swing'and will cam the pins 188 down, thus withdrawing the locking bars 1 85 from the pinions. 
 Referring now to the transfer mechanism (best shown in Figs. 18 .and 19): For each totalizer, there is a separate set of transfer devices. It has been explained that the type bars 3 are movedfto their normal lower position by the rod 29. The extent of downward movement of the type bars 3 is limited by the rod 5. The extent of downward movement ot' the racks is limited (except in the transfer operation) by contact of lugs 193 on the racks with stop lugs 194. When an amount is to be transferred from one order to the next higher order, the stop lug 194 for the rack belonging to such higher order is withdrawn, thereby allowing that rack to descend under the action of its spring 135 until its lug 193 stops against the bar 129 as indicated in the right-hand. portion of Fig. 18 and the left-hand portion of Fig. 19'. The extent of such further descent of the rack is just suicient to turn the pinion for that rack through the distance of one tooth. Each stop lug 194 is formed on :in arm or pawl 195 which is suspended from a pivot 196 in the framework of the machine, said pivot being above the horizontal plane of the pinions. To the lower end of cach pawl 195 is pivoted a dog 197 having a tooth 198 adapted to engage the edge of .the adjacent bar 129. There is a dog 197 at the right-hand side of each rack except the units rack. The dog 197- lies within a horizontal groove 199 (Fig. 20) 
in the bar 129'. A contractile spring 200 normally holds the tooth-198.jn engagement with the bar 129, the; stop lug .194' being then in position to support the rack at the left of the dog 197. I 
 The means for disengaging the tooth 198 from the bar 129 consists of a lug 201 (Fig. 21) fixed to the left side of each pinion. WV-hen the amount registered by a pinion reaches 9, continued rotation of the pinion as the rack descends brings the lug 209 against the end of the dog 197, thereby depressing the dog until 'thetooth 198 is clear of the bar 129, whereupon -the spring 200 (assisted by the downward pressure ofthe rack) pulls the dog and the pawl 195 away from therack until a lug 202 on the dog stops against a. restoring rod 203. The lug 194 is then out of the path of therack of the next higher order, and the latter therefore moves downunder the infiuence of its spring 135 until stopped by the bar 129. 
 After each transfer operation the pawl 195 and the dog 197 are restored to their normal position by the rod 203, there being one such restoringrod for each of the sets of transfer mechanism. Each rod 203 is carried by two bell crank levers 204 which are pivoted in 'the framework of the machine at v196. 
The bell crank levers at each side of the machine are connected for simultaneous swinging movement by a pin and slot connection, as shown at 205 in F ig. 19; The restoring rods 203 are simultaneously moved toward and away from each other by means ofA twoarms 206 each formed integral with one of the bell crank levers 204, said arms 206 extending into the space between the side members 16. A' rod 207 (Fig. 1), the ends of which lie in elongated openings 208 in the side members 16 is normally held afrainst the lower end walls of said openings by means of two springs 209 extending between said rod and the rod 15. One of said springs is shown in Fig. l. When the side members 16 move downwardly in the forward stroke of the handle 27, (and hence as the type bars 3 are moving upwardly), the rod 207 is carried into engagement with the arms 206, thereby causing the rods 203 to move toward each other to restore any transfer devices that may have been concerned in a previous transfer operation. When the side members 16 rise, a contractile spring 210 (Fig. 19) returns the rods 203 to the normal position shown in said View. Such :normal position is determined by Contact of the bell crank levers 204 with. the stop rods 139 (Fig. 18). 
 When the type bars are raised for a; printing operation, the racks do not begin to rise until the studs 133 (Fig. 18) engage the upper ends of the elongated openings 134. Those racks, however, which have descended below the normal position, in order to effect a transfer, rise practically simultaneously with the type bars, and thus are lifted before the stop lugs 194 are restored tonormal position by the rod 203. So, also, the movement impartedto the type -bars during the enforced spacing stroke of the handle 27 is suiicient to raise t-he lugs 193 to permit the placing `of the stop lugs 194 thereunder. (For'a' disclosure of one form of enforced spacing stroke mechanism suitable for usevin this machine, reference may be had to my l Patent No. 1,583,102.) 
. type bars 3 are -then in position to print the total amount accumulated on the pini'ons. 
 The herein-described arrangement of racks andpinions, with springs 135 anchored to a downward extension of the type bar -lying between the racks, and cross-bars 129 serving the double function of guiding the racks and cooperating-iwiththe transfer dogs'197, has solved the problem of introducing a duplex 'addingmechanism into an adding' machine of the Sandstrand type without increasing the over-all dimensions of the latter. 
 As hereinbefore stated, when an item is to be added, thetotalizer into which the Vitem is to be introduced is out of mesh with its racks during the upward movement of the latter and is in mesh with' the racks during their descent. lVhen a total is to be taken, the totalizer remains in mesh with the racks during the rising movement of the latter. 1t will be remembered that 'the means for placing the totalizers in and out of mesh with their racks includes the cam 153 and the pawl 158 A(Fig. 14). the pawl 158 so as to determine whether the totalizer shall be in or out of mesh during the upward and downward movements of the racks will now be described. 
 The means for controlling engagement of the pawl 158 with the pin 162 includes an arm 211 (Fig. 11) pivoted at 212in the niachine frame, the upper end of said arm having an angular lug '213 adapted to hold the -pawl 158 out of position to engage said pin. 1n the arm 211 is an elongated opening 214 in which lies a pin 215 fixed to the swinging frame 48, As explained in the Sandstrand Patents Nos. 1,198,487 and 1,583,102, when there is no number set up in the group of stops 42, the frame 48c is in its forward position. .AS 'soon as a digit is set up in the machine, the frame 48 swings back, thereby swinging the arm 211 rearwardly away from the pawl 158 and leaving said pawl in posi'- tion .to engage the pin 162 when the handle 2T is pulled. After a spacing stroke of the handle, the frame 48 is in its forward posivtion, and the pawl 158 is held out of engagementwith the pin 162; consequently the cam 153 is not moved during the forward lstroke of the handle 27, and the debit totalizer remains in mesh with its racks during the rise of nthelatter, thereby effecting the position- -ing'of the type bars for the printing of the debit total. 1 Theprinting of the debit total is thiis automatic, that is to say, without any manipulation other than the operation of the handle 27. Theprinting of a credit total, however, requires depression of theA credit key 170, as willv appear hereinafter. 
 When it is not desired to clearthe totalizer after printing a total, the totalizeiA is, allowedto remain in mesh with itsracks during the downward movement Ithereof, and therefore during the ldownward movement Aof the racks the several pinions of the total- ,izer are rotated to the positions Jthey occupied just before the taking of the total. Vhen', however, the operator wishes to clear the totalizer, the latter is withdrawnv from its racks before the racks descend. The 
The means for controlling p means for swingingthe cam 153 to effect. 
such movement of the pinions comprises a lever 216 (Figs. 4 and 11) pivoted -on the `lies a roller 218 on the cam 153. The lever 2.16 has an arm 219 which is arranged to be engaged by a pin 220 (Fig. 12) on the arm 24. 
 During adding operations and during the enforced blank stroke of the handle 27 the cam 153 is swung by the pawl 158, and the lever 216: swings idly; but when one of the totalizers is to be cleared, the pawl 158 is held out of action, and the cam 153 is swungr by the lever 216 at the beginning of the return stroke of the handle, so as tolwithdraw the totalizer from its racksr before the latter descend, whereby the pinions are left standing at zero. The means for swinging the lever 216. forward to disengage the totalizer from the racks is controlled by a clear or total key 221 (Fig. 4) having a vstem 222. On the stem 222 is a stud 223 that underlies the forward end of a lever 224. The lever 224 has an elongated opening 225 through which a pivot rod 226 extends, the lever 224 thus being movable longitudinally to -a slight extent. A cont-ractile spring 227 tends to slide the lever 224 rearwardly. 228 (Fig. 8)-is a contractile'spring stretched between a pin on the stem 222 and the front end of the lever 224 and tending tohold the stud 223 and the'lever 224 in contact with each other. Duringl the printing of an item and during the enforced blank or spacing stroke prior to the taking of a total, the lever 224 is held against movement by the spring 228 by ymeans comprising a cam plate 229 (Fig 8) which is pivoted at 23() and is acted upon by a contractile spring 231. 0n the rear end of the lever 224 is a pin 232 underlying the camplate 229. The spring 231 normally holds the cam plate 229 in contact with a sleeve or antifriction roller v233 (Fig. 5) on a stud 234 carried by the adjacent lever 19. The movement of the cam plate 229 under the infiuence of the spring 231 is restrained at times by a detent arm (Figs. 4 and 7) pivoted at 236 in the framework of the .ma- 
chine and normally held by a contractile spring 237 in contactwith the stud 234 (Fig. 
- 5). On the detent 'arm 235 isa pin 238 (Fig. 
7) adapted to engage a hook 239 (Figs. 4 and 8) on the cam plate 229. At times the detent arm 235 is prevented from moving under the 'influence of the spring. 237 into position P where the pin 238 is in front of the -hook 239, by means of a pin 240 (Figs. 4 and 11) on an arm 241y which is rigid with-thearm 211. 
The upper end of the arm235 iscut away so as to clear the pin 240 when the arm 211 is in its rearward position (as it is when an'A item has been setup or an enforced'bl'ank stroke i's to be taken). 
 A detent plate 242 (Fig. 9) pivoted on the center 230 has a cam slot 243 having a dwell portion 244 in which the roller 233 (Fig. 5) is arranged to run. That portion of the pin 232 which projects from the inner side ofthe lever 224 underlies the plate 242 (see Fig. 5).. In the lower edge of the plate 242 is a notch 244 (Fig. 9). 
 It will be remembered that the roller 233 and the stud 234 are connected to swing back and forth with the handle 27. Even ifV the total key were held depressed while the handle was being drawn forward to print an item, or takel an enforced blank stroke, -the lever 224 would be held against movement by the-Spring 228, by the cam plate 229 overlying the pin 232; the spring 231, in turn, being prevented from moving the cam plate 229 by means of the pin 238. But after the blank stroke has been taken, the swinging frame 48 (and consequently the arm 241) are in their forward position, andtheret'ore if the total key 221be depressed, the cam plate 229 is free to follow the roller 233 as the handle is drawn forf ward to clear the machine, until the pin 232 on the rear end of the lever 224 has risen under the influence of the spring 228 until said'pin 232 is in a locking notch 245 (Fig. 8) in the cam plate 229. The pin 232 does not enter said notch 245 until the movement of the plate 242 (Fig. 9) under the action of the roller 233 has brought the notch 244 into register with said pin 232, whereupon the 'pin 232 enters the notches 244 and 245. Very shortly after the handle 27 has commenced its return stroke, the" roller 233 acting on the walls of the cam. -slot 243, swings the plate 242 downwardly, 
thus pushing the pin232 and the lever 224 forwardly. On the lever 224 is a shoulder 246 (Figs. 4 and 8) adapted 'to engagea pin 247 on the lever 216 when-the lever 224 is tilted by the spring 228. v When the lever 224 is pushed forward by the plate 242. the shoulder 246 pushes 'the lever 216 forward, thereby swinging the cam 153 upwardly, thus pulling the link 144 forward, and hence moving ythe totalizer out of mesh with its' racks. As before indicated, this occurs during the early part of the return movement of the handle 27 and before the racks descend, the. pinions being therefore left standing at zero. As the roller 233 continues on its return stroke, it swings the cam .late 229 against the tension of the spring 231, the lower edge of said plate positively camming the pin 232 down, and thus, in conjunction with the spring 27, restoring the. lever 224-.to .its initial-:por-inoperative position. As the ar-m 24 (Fig. 11) returns to its'initial positioxuthe pin 220 (Fig. 12) 'thereon' engagesethe Aarm 219 and restores the 'lever 216 to its initial position. 
 )Vlien the totalizer was withdrawn from its racks, the type bars usedin printing the total rose to the top limit of their movement, 
l l under the influence of the springs 14; In v the continuation of the back stroke of .the 
-raeks 130 atrthe beginning of the down stroke. A slide 255 (Fig: 8) is mounted-on two guide studs' 256 "for movement longitudinally of the machine, th'e slidebeing slotted at 255"L to receive said studs. On the slide 255 is a cam surface 257. A contractile spring 258 tends to draw the slide-255 rearwardly to' bring the cam surface 257into such position that when the pawl;vl58 is carried forward .a pin 259 on said pawl shall engage the surface 257,'thus holding `the .pawl down so that onY its return stroke the vshoulder 158b (Fig-14) shall be unable'to engagey the pin 163,. vThe slide 255 isnor- 'mally locked in its forward position by a stud 260 (Fig. 8) ,on a bell'crank 261j.pv oted on the axis 226. A contractile spring 262 normallyy holds the bell crank in such position that the stud 260 lies behind a' lug 263 on the 'slide 255. The means -for withdrawing th'e stud 260 from said lug. com-V prises a non-add keyv264. having astem`265 which is guided for vertical movement. On the stem 265Jis'a -pin'266 that overlies a lug 267 onsthe bell crank 261. The spring 228 vthat normally holds the total key-up serves also to hold the non-add key elevated, there being a lug 268 on the total keystem "which underlies'the pin 266.`- The. non-add keyis locked in depressed position bymeans of a lever 269- (Fig. 6)` pivoted at 27 O and having- 'a notch 271 to receive a pin 272 (Fig. 4) on the non-add key-stem. The free en d 273 of the lever 269 is arranged. to` be engaged by the locking-finger 178 (Fig. 4)'. A 
' The'slide 255 isrestore'd to` its 'forward position by means of the lever 274 (Fig. 4) that actuates the ribbon feedmechanism, the 
' lowerend of said lever lying behind the rearv end ofthe slide.l The lever 274 is connected tothe adjacent lever l9'th'rough alink 275.A 
 When a number is to be printed, but not added, the operator depresses the non-add key 264 and pulls the'handle 27 forward. Depression-ot the non-add key withdraws the stud k'260 from the lug '2263.v As the handle- 27. swings forward, the ribbon-feed lever 274 swings rearward, thus allowing vthe spring 258 to draw the` slide 255 to its rearward position, that is to say, until the end walls of the slots 2553L stop against the studs 256. As vthe'handle. 27 makes its forward swing, the pin 259 on the pawl 158 engages the cam surface 257, whereby the pawl is depressed to suchy-anvextent that on the return stroke of the pawl it fails to engage the pin 163. The totalizer therefore is not thrown into mesh withits rac-ks at the'beginning of the downward stroke of the latter, and consequently the number setup and printed isnot added. As the handle makes its rearward: swing, the pin 220 (Fig. 12) on the arm 24 engages' the arm 219 and restores the l.lever 216 to initial-position, thereby returning the l-pinions `into mesh with the racks. In the returnstroke of the handle, the lever ribbon-feed 274 pushes the slide 255 forward to its normal position, asin Fig. 4. As the handle is approaching its initial position, the lookin g linger-178 (Fig. 4) is disengaged from the-arm v2730i the lever 269, whereupon the'non-add key springs up to its 'normal position, thus allowing'the'spring 262 (Fig. '8) yto place the stud 260 behind the lug-263 on the'slide 2,55. 
 In actual practice, there is no occasion for printing a credit item without also adding it, hence no' provision is made for preventing accumulation when the credit totalizer is in use. l 
 The hammer mechanism `.and the signprinting mechanisln may be of any suitable character, as,4 for example, that fully' disclosed in my said application Serial No. 670,665, and therefore need not be here described.v 
' The machine is preferably arranged to .print items andtotalfs in contrasting colors, as,for example, items in-blue and totals in red. The means vfor shifting the ribbon'to lprint in theude'sired color may be of any suitable character, f as, for example, that'v em' ployed in 'the' Sandstrand Patent N o. 1,198,- 487,"` a'ndtherefore has not beenv disclosed hereinin' detail?. 
 If desiredfmeansmay Abe provided for printing a' distinguishing character in conneetion with certain imprints, as, for example,"in connection witha credit item, a final debit total, a," credit total, or an item which is printed but notV added to the previous items; or to indicate that either or both totalizers are clear. Hereinis shown a special sign-printing` bar 3 (Figs. 8 and 14) vwhich is constructed and operated substantially as disclosed 'in application Serial No. 670,665'. It will be understood that any appropriate sign may be substituted for the credit sign herein shown.. 
When it is desired toadd an amount withi out printin y it, the hammer-mechanism may be disable by means comprising a nonprint key 348 (Fig. 2), as fully described in application Serial No. 670,665. 
 The capabilities of the machine are indicated by the facsimiles of printed matter constituting Figs. 22 to 25. In these views dotted lines are used to denote red imprints. 
 Referring first to Fig. 22, the red imprint a is a sign indicating that the debit totalizer is clear and the red imprint b is a sign de noting that `the credit totalizer is clear. These signs are.printed by depressing the keys 17 0 and221, pulling the handle, releasing said keys and pulling the handle again. Fig. 22 shows that four debit items were printed and accumulated in the debit totalizer. In setting up, registering and printing the next item (which is a credit item of 12e) the operator set up the item on the keyboard, depressed the credit key 170 and pulled the handle, thus printing the item, together with its distinguishing sign, and introduced the item into the front or credit totalizer. The same operations were repeated in connection with the next three items, the credit key 170 being depressed before or after the setting up of each credit item. A final total of the debit items and a final total of the credit items is then obtained by first taking a blank or spacing stroke of the handle, then depressing the credit key 170 and the clear or total key 221, pullingthe handle a second time (whereby the debit total of 1.22 is printed in red, together with the debit clear sign, and the debit totalizer cleared), and pulling the handle a third time, whereby the credit total of 1.13 is printed in red, together with the credit sign, and the credit totalizer cleared. 
 The operations that occurred during these three reciprocations of the handle will now be described. 
 The addition of the last credit item of .2() left the credit totalizer standing in mesh with the racks 131 and the link 144 in en gagement with the upper pin 149 (Fig. 14). In the forward stroke just referred to 'as the blank or spacing stroke the pawl 158 engaged the pin 162 and swung the cam 153 up, thus pulling the link 144 forward and thereby moving the totalizers rearwardly into central position. As the link 144 completed its forward movement it slipped down into engagement with the lower pin 150. In the ensuing return stroke of the handle, the link 144 was pushed rearwardly thus placing the debit totalizer in mesh with its racks 130; and the detent plate 48a moved forward out of the way of the pins. 46, the arm 211 (Fig. 11) moving forward so as to hold the pawl158 out of position to engage the pin 162. The credit and clear keys were then depressed. 
 During the following forward stroke of the handle, the pawl 158 being held out of action by the arm 211 (Fig. 11), the debit totalizer remained in mesh with the racks 130 during their upward movement. During the initial portion of the following return movement of the handle, the slide 255 prevented the pawl 158 from engaging the pin 163; and the roller 233, through the agency of the cam plate 242, pin 232 and levers 224 and 216, swung the cam 153 up, thereby withdrawing the debit totalizer from the racks 130 before they descended and thus leaving said totalizer cleared. Such withdrawal of the debit totalizer from the racks 13() was caused by forward movement of the link 144, in the course of which the up er pin 149 (F ig. 13) came into register wit the notch 147,l whereupon the spring 169 raised the link 144 to place said notch and pin in engagement with each other. During the latter portion of the return stroke of the handle, the pin 220 (Fig. 12) on the arm 24, acting through the arm 219 and the lever 216, restored thev cam 153 to its normal down position, thereby pushing the link 144 rearwardly and placing the credit'totalizer in mesh with the racks 131. 
 The handle being pulled the third time, with the clear and credit keys held de pressed, the pawl 158 being held out of action by the arm 211, the credit totalizer remained in mesh with the racks 131 during their upward movement. During the early part of the ensuing return stroke of the handle, the slide 255 prevented the pawl 158 from engaging the pin 163; and the roller 233, cani plate 242, pin 232, and levers 224 and 216 raised the cam 153, thereby withdrawing the credit totalizer from the racks 131 before they descended and thus leaving said totalizer cleared. Such withdrawal of the credit totalizer was effected by forward movement of the link 144. During the latter part of the return stroke of the handle, the pin 220 on the arm 24, acting through the arm 219 and the lever 216, returned the cam 153 to its down position, thereby push- -ing the link 144 rearwardly, the notch 147 remaining in engagement with the upper pin 149, and the credit totalizer being thus returned into mesh with the racks 131. 
 Fig. 23 shows that the machine'may be used for alternately printing items of two dierent classes. It will be apparent that in a machine provided with a laterally-shiftable paper carriage arranged to occupy one position when printing items of one class and another position for items of theother class, the items will be Iprinted in parallel columns. If desired, the rear totalizer may be used in printing a designating lnumber opposite each number printed with the front totalizer, such designating numbers being non-accumulated. 
Fig. 24 indicates that the machine may be i used to take a subtotal from the rear or debit totalizer. The operatioh of registeringl and printing the debit item of 5.67 left therear totalizer in mesh with its racks 130, and the notch 148 in engagement with the pin 150, as shown in Fig. 13, the detent plate 48 being in its rear position where it prevents rising movement of the type bars 3. It being desired to obtain a iinal total from the credit totalizer and a subtotal from the debit totalizer, the operator depresses the credit key 170 and pulls the handle 27. In the l course of the forward stroke of the handle the pawl 158 engages the pin/162 and lifts the cam 153, thereby pulling the link 144 forward and thus placingthe totalizers incentral position. As soon as the upper pin 149 and thenotch 147 come into register with each other, the spring 169 lifts the link 144 into engagement with said pin. In the returnmovement of the handle the pawl 158 engages the pin 163, thereby swinging the cam 153 downward and pushing the link 144 rearward, thereby moving the front totalizer into engagement with the racks 131. The detent plate 48a also was moved forward out of the way of the pins 46, thereby causing the arm 211. (Fig. 11) to swing forward into engagement with the pawl 158. The operator then depresses the clear or total key 221, and pulls the handle a second time. The pawl 158 being prevented from engaging the pin 162, the cam 153 remains in its down position; consequently, the credit totalizer remains in mesh with its racks while the latter rise to printing position, their'ascent be'y ing limited by engagement of the lugs 201 (Fig. 21) with the front set of pawls V197. In the initial portion of the returnmovgment of the handle the hammers are released to print the credit total of 6.12 and the credit sign; the slide 255 prevents the pawl 158 from engaging the pin 163 and the' roller 233 swings the cam 153 up, thereby 'pulling the link 144 forward and thus With- `drawing the credit totalizer from the racks 131 before the latter descend, and hence leaving the credit totalizer' clear. In the movement of the link, the pin 150 is moved into register with the notch 148v` whereupon the link 144 drops into engagement with said pin,'as shown in Fig. 13. During the latter part of the return stroke of the handle, the pin 220, arm 219 and lever 216 restore the cam 153 to initial position and thus move the link 144, thereby placing the debit totalizer in mesh with the racks 130. The tota-l\ key 221 rises under the influence of the spring 228 as the lever 224 returns to normal position. The detent plate 48a and the arm 211 `being still in their forward position, when the operator again pulls the handle the pawl 158 is prevented from engaging the pin 162, consequently the cam 153' remains in initial position and the debit totalizer remains in mesh with the racks 130 during their rising movement (whereby the racks 130 are positioned for printing the debit total 8.46) and during the descent of the racks. I 
 In the specimen of work reproduced in Fig. 25, th'e debit items have been cleared from the rear totalizer from time to time, while the credit items have been retained in the front totalizer until lthe end of opera tions. 
 yIt will be understood that the front totalizer has been called the credit totalizer merely for convenience, and that it may be used to receive items of various classes. 
 It will be apparent that the rear totalizer may be used 1n calculations involving subtraction, multiplication' and division in the manner commonly employed in ordinary socalled adding, machines. 
 While the present embodiment of the invention has4 been described in considerable detail, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular construction and arrangement of the parts and mechanisms shown, and that various modifications coming within the scope of the appended claims will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art.
