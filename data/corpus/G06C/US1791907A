, General description This invention, for convenience, is applied to an adding and subtracting totalizer of the type illustrated and described in the patents and the application referred to above, the invention residing in part, in the provision of a device to automatically cause a single unit to be added into theunits totalizer wheel when an overdraft occurs and durin the same operation on which. the overdra t occurs, thus insuring that the totalizer will register the correct amount at the termination of the operation. 
 The novel totalizer selecting and the rectification of the overdraft features are included in a machine substantially the same as that disclosed in the above referred to copending application, and enough of the former construction is shown herein to convey a full understanding of the present invention, reference being made to the prior patents and application cited for a more complete disclosure of those elements which do not form a part of the present invention. 
Keyboard The machine includes a keyboard having a plurality of banks of amount keys 40 (Fig. 1), depression of which sets up the amounts to be added onto, or subtracted from, the adding and subtracting totalizer 104, 105, and which are -to be accumulated on any of the other totalizers with which the machine may be provided. 
 Only the units bank of amount keys 40 (Fig. 1), and the add and subtract keys 41 and 42 respectively, (Fig. 4), which control the adding and subtracting totalizer, are shown herein. 
Amount keys and 45, extending between the right sideframe 46 13) and the left side frame 47 (Figs. 1 and 13) of the machine. 
 The keys 40 cooperate with a locking detent bar 48 supported at its upper and lower ends by links 49 and 50 pivoted on the key frame 43. 
 Depression of a key 40 cams the detent bar 48 downwardly until a shoulder 51 on the key wipes past a stud 52 on the detent, whereupon a spring, not shown, returns the detent bar to its'normal position, with the stud 52 over the shoulder 51 on the key to lock the latter in its de ressed position. 
 Near the enfof each adding or subtracting operation of the machine, the depressed keys 40 are released by a rocking release shaft 53 having a plurality of arms 54 fast thereon, which support a rod 55. v 
 The release shaft 53, when rocked counter clockwise (Fig. 1), presses the rod 55 against the tails formed on the free ends of the links 49 supporting the upper ends of the detent bars 48 to cam the links 49 clockwise about their pivots. The links 49 shift the detent bars 48 downwardly to release the depressed keys. Springs (not shown) then restore the keys 40 to their home positions. 
' The keys 40 of each amount bank control their respective denominational zero stop pawl (Fig. 1), the purpose of which is to arrest the corresponding difierential actuator 62, associa d with each bank of keys when no key in the row is depressed. Depression of a key in any amount row or bank rocks the corresponding zero stop pawl 60 counter-clockwise to its inefi'ective position by means not shown herein, but fully disclosed in the above-mentioned patents and application. 
Amount dz'fierential mechanism The difierential mechanism associated with each of the amount banks of keys actuates the totalizers to accumulate thereon the various amounts set up by depression of the amount keys, and, diflerentially adjusts various other elements, such as indicators, printing elements, etc, none of which are shown herein inasmuch as they form no part of the present invention. .The diderential mechanism also functions in total taking operations, and at such times, is controlled as to its ad vance by the totalizer wheels. 
 This differential mechanism is identical with the difierential mechanisms illustrated and described in the above mentioned patents and application, wherefore only a brief description thereof will be given. 
 The difierential mechanism for each denomination includes a diderentially movable member comprising a pair of substantially circular-disks 62 and 63, between which are mounted in peripherally spaced relation a number of segmental actuating racks 64, 65 and 66 corresponding with the number of lines of totalizers in the machine. The disks 62 and 63 are fast on a hub 67 journaled on a stud 68 supported by hangers 69 and 70, which in turn, are supported on cross rods 71 and 72 extending between the side frames 46 and 47 of the machine. A link 74 and a bell crank 75 pivotally support a latch 73 on the difierentially adjustable member 62, 63, which latch releasably connects the diderentially adjustable member 62, 63 with an invariably movable driving segment 7 6 also pivoted on the stud 68. A. spring 77 holds the foot of the latch 7 3 in engagement with a shoulder (not shown) on the skeletonized drive segment 7 6. A pair of cams 7 8 pinned to a drive shaft ?9 rock a bell crank lever 80 pivoted on the hanger 70. A link 81 connects the upper end of the lever 80 with the driving segment 76. The cams 78 make one complete rotation in clockwise direction at each operation of the machine to impart a constant excursion to the drive segment 76, first clockwise, and then counter-clockwise to normal position. 011 its clockwise movement, the drive segment ?6 carries with it the latch 73 and the differentially movable member 62, 63 untihthe forward arm of the bell ci ank 75 contacts the inner end of a depressed key, or the zero stop pawl 60 in those banks wherein no keys have been depressed, whereupon the bell crank 75 rocks countenclockwise about its pivot and disconnects the latch 7 3 from the drive segment 61. Such disconnection of the latch 73 enters the nose thereof into one of a plurality of notches 82 formed in a serrated bar 33 supported on the cross rod 72 and the upper end of the hanger 70, to lock the amount keys 40, the end of the beam 90 which is pivoted thereto, is also positioned, after which a roller .93 on the bell crank lever 80 contacts the lower edge of the beam 90, durin g the operation of the machine, to complete the adjustment of this beam, and conse quently adjust the differential link 92. 
 The upper end of each differential link 92 positions its aligning se ment 94 on a shaft 96, and the lower end 0 each link positions its arm 95 journaled on a shaft 97. 
 A spiral segment gear 101 fast on the arm 95 meshes with a spiral pinion 102 pinned to a printer shaft 103 for the purpose of adjusting the corresponding printing element (not shown). 
 After the totalizer actuator racks 64, 65 and 66 have been advanced to correspond with the value of the amount keys depressed, the selected totalizer, or tot-alizers, are moved into engagement therewith. ,The actuators 62, 63 are then returned counter-clockwise to their normal positions at the same time rotating the denominational totalizer wheels a number of steps commensurate with the value of the amount keys 40 depressed, to thereby accumulate on the totalizer the amount set up on the keyboard The totalizer selecting mechanism and the mechanism ,for engaging and disengaging the totalizers with the actuators are not illustrated or described herein, but are fully disclosed in the above-mentioned patents and application, to which reference is made for a complete explanation thereof. 
T otalize-rs front and the back lines, have ten totalizers oneach line, consisting of a plurality of interspersed adding wheels journaled on atube. 
 As these totalizers are fully illustrated and dm-zcribed in the above-mentioned patents, no further description thereof is thought necessary for an understanding of the present invention. 
 The third or upper totalizer line supports a single adding and subtracting totalizer comprising a plurality of pairs of wheels (Figs. 1, 11 and'12), each pair including a positive wheel 104 and a negative wheel 105 (Fig. 13) spaced apart and rotatably mounted on a totalizer shaft 106. Only the pinions of the highest order and of the lowest order are shown herein. Two intermediate bevel pinions 107 (Fig. 11) loose on the opposite ends of a pin 108 projecting diametrically through the shaft 106 between the spaced wheels 104 and 105, of each pair mesh with bevel gears 109 and 110 fast on the positive and the negative totalizer wheels 104 and 105, respectively, to couple like denominational wheels of the adding and subtracting totalizer together in such a manner that when a denominational wheel of one pair is rotated in one direction, the remaining Wheel of the pair will be rotated the same number of steps in the opposite direction. Collars 111 fast on the outer ends of the pins 108 retain the intermediate pinions 107 in place. 
 The totalizer shaft 106 is mounted in end frames 112 (Figs. 3 and 13) and 113 (Figs. 8, 9 and 13) which depend from and are slid- ,able along a supporting shaft 115. A rod 114 extends between the frames to afford rig idity and to properly space them apart. This rod 114, the totalizer shaft 106, and the end frames 112 and 113 form a frame for the adding and subtracting totalizer slidable longitudinally on the supporting shaft 115. 
 A rod 120 (Figs. 8, 10 and 13) extending downwardly from the frame 113 carries an anti-friction roller 121 embraced between the walls of a channel formed in a drum cam 122. This drum cam is journaled on a stud in the side frame 47 and is differentially adjusted under control of the add key 41 (Fig.4) and the subtract key 42 to shift the adding, subtracting totalizer axially along the shaft 115, to position the adding Wheels 104 or the subtracting wheels 105 opposite the single set of actuators 62, 63 common to both sets of adding and subtracting wheels. The differential mechanism controlled by the add key 41 and the subtract key 42, for adjusting the totalizer shifting cam 122 to select the adding or subtracting side of the totalizer, is identical with the differential mechanism disclosed in the inventors co-pending application referred to above, to which reference is made for an explanation thereof, and is not shown herein. 
 The rod 120 shifts with the adding and subtracting totalizer and is guided, with respect to the shaft 115, by a slot 146 in a bracket 147 (Figs. 10 and 13) secured to the left side frame 47. The upper part of the roller 121 lies in the slot 146. This bracket also prevents the totalizer frame from turning about the shaft 115. 
 As shown in Figure 13, the drum cam 122 is in the position to which it has been adjusted under control of the subtract key 42 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the negative totalizer wheels 105 are in line with the totalizer actuator racks 64. When the drum cam 122 is adjusted under control of the add key %1 (Fig. 4), 
Fugitive one mechanism During an operation of the machine, if an amount greater than the amount on the positive wheels 104 is to be subtracted therefrom, the remainder will be a negative balance. When this happens an overdraft is said to occur. This negative balance will, ordinarily however, be short of the correct amount by one. I 
 To correct the totalizer so that the appropriate side will register the correct amount after an overdraft has occurred, mechanism is provided, in the present machine, iior automatically adding a single unit onto the total izer wheel of lowest order during the opera tion in which the overdraft occurs. 
 The invention is efiiective to supply the fugitive one in the event the overdraft occurs by subtracting a larger amount from a smaller amount already registered on the positive side of the adding and subtracting totalizer, or by adding a larger amount to a smaller amount already registered on the negative side of the adding and subtracting totalizer. 
The operator in registering positive and negative amounts on the adding and subtracting totalizer will depress the add key 41 to accumulate the positive amounts on the adding wheels 10 1 of the totalizer, and will depress the subtract key 42 to accumulate negative amounts on the subtracting wheels 105. 
 lhe add and subtract lreys Hand 42 control mechanism not herein shown, to rock the drum cam 122 (Fig, 13) in one direction or the other, whereby to shift the adding and subtracting totalizer along the shaft 115 to bring the adding wheels 10%, or the subtracting wheels 105, into alinement with the single set of actuators 62, 63 common to both the sets of wheels 10 1, 105. Thereafter the positive and negative amounts set 11 on the amount keys are added onto t e corresponding set of wheels. 
 Normally the adding and subtracting totalizer is assumed to be clear, that is, the adding wheels 104 of a machine having a capacity of seven denominations, will register 0,000,000 While the subtracting wheels erner reversely rotate the remaining set of totalizer wheels to directly subtract a similar amount therefrom, except where the amount added is suliicient to transform the balance from positive to negative, or vice versa. 
 In the art, this transformation of balance is known as passing through zero and is accomplished by adding an amount on the negative side which is in excess of the amount registered on the positive side, or by adding an amount on the positive side which is greater than the balance registered on the negative .side. 
 Assuming that the operator starts with the positive totalizer cleared, as above setforth, 
and wishes to enter the following items the proper balance will be 30 0n a machine not equipped with this invention, he will first depress the add key 41 to set the totalizer selecting mechanism (not shown) so that upon operation of the machine, the adding and subtracting totalizer 104, 105 will he slid along the supporting shaft 115 to bring the adding wheels 104 in line with the actuators 62, 63, 
 He will also depress the proper amount lreys 10 to set up the item 54 and operate the machine, whereupon the item 54 will be accumulated on the adding wheelslOd of the adding and subtracting totalizer so that at the end of the operation the two sides of the totalizer will register Adding side 0,000,054 Subtracting side 9,999,945 
 It will be noted that the wheels 105 of the subtracting side of the totalizer register an amount which is the complement less 1 of the amount registered by the adding wheels tractin totalizer will register amounts as follows: 
Adding wheels 9,999,958 Subtracting wheels 0,000,041 
 Here it will be noted that the subtracting wheels register one less than the true result, and that the adding wheels register Adding wheels 9,999,970 Subtracting wheels 0,000,029 
 The true balance should be but the subtracting wheels register one less than the true balance, while the adding wheels register one less than the complement of the amount registered on the subtracting wheels, and as the totalizer is concealed, the operator does not know whether he has a positive or negative balance, and hence does not know on which side of the totalizer he should add the fugitive one. 
 Heretofore, the fu itive one has been supplied at the end 0 the entry of all the items, but it obviously would be the better plan to contrive means which would cause the totalizer to register the true balance at any point in the operation of entering amounts. 
 To obtain this result, a transfer mechanism for the units bank is provided, and means contrived to trip such units transfer mechanism each time the balance passes through zero in either direction, the invention residing in the novel means emplo ed to trip the transfer mechanism for the un1ts totalizer wheels 104, 105. 
 A transfer segment 125 (Fig. 1) formed on the outer end of an arm 119 ivoted at 176 between the disks 62 and 63 o the units differential lies in the same vertical plane with the actuator rack 64, and is adapted to be latched to the actuator rack 64 when the units differential rocks clockwise out of its normal position in the following manner. 
 A square stud 126 carried by the head of a latching lever 127 pivoted on the units transfer segment 125, normally rests against the end 128 of a transfer stop arm 129 pivoted on the stationary supportinghanger69,to normally hold thetransfer segment 125 in the position shown in Figure 1, in which the segment 125 is spaced apart from the adjacent end of the actuator rack 64 against the tension of a spring'130 connected to the head of the latching lever 127. The spring 130 constantly urges the lever 127 in a counter-clock pgge direction about its pivot on the segment A recessed projectionor holder 132 is mounted to travel with the differential member 62, 63, the tail of the lever 127 having a stud 131 normally engaging the projection above its recess 177. 
 Clockwise movement of the differential member 62, 63 closes the gap between the actuator rack 64 and the transfer segment 125, which is yieldingly held against movement by the spring 130 until contact of the rack 64 therewith. As soon as this occurs, the spring 130 rocks the latching lever 127 counter-clockwise and moves the stud 131 on the tail of such lever, into the recess 177 of the projection 132 which advances with the differential member 62, 63 and relatively to the lever 127. .The lever 127 thus latches the transfer segment 125 to the actuator rack 64, so that the actuator rack and the transfer se ment now move as a unit. 
 en the differentials have been arrested under control of the depressed keys, the wheels 104 or 105 of the selected side of the addin and subtracting totalizer are enga ed with t eir respective actuator racks 64, a ter which the actuator racks are restored to their normal positions. As the units differential member 62, 63 on its return, as heretofore explained, approaches the position shown in Fig. 1, the square stud 126 on the latching levers 127 strikes the end 128 of the transfer stop arm 129 which arrest causes the lever 127 to rock clockwise about its ivot on the units transfer segment 125 to un ock the segment 125 from the differential rack 64. The transfer segment 125 is now held in the position shown in Fig. 1, by contact of the stud 126 with the transfer stop arm 129, and the differential continues its movement to its normal position. 
 A flat-stud 135 (Figs. 1 and 3) on a catch 136'fast on a stub shaft 139, normally engages a shoulder 137 formed intermediate the ends of a slot 138 in the transfer stop arm 129 to hold the stop arm 129 in the osition shown, with the end 128 thereof in t e path of the square stud 126, against the tension of a spring 133 connected to the transfer sto arm. Releasing the catch 136 from the shou der 137 frees the transfer stop arm 129 to the action of its spring 133, which rocks the stop arm in clockwise direction (Fig. 3) to re move the end face 128 of the stop arm from the path of the stud 126 on the latching lever, and thus enable the transfer segment 125 (Fig. 1) to accompany the segmental rack 64 as the latter completes its return to home position. This, in effect, lengthens the rack 64 so as to impart asingle extra step of movement to whichever units wheel, 104 or 105, may at that time be in engagement with the rack 64. 
The upper end Wall of the slot 138 in the catch 136 contacts, and is arrested by, the pin 135 in the catch to limit the clockwise travel of the transfer stop arm. 
 That the units wheel shall be turned but a single additional step, the transfer stop arm 129 carries a shoulder 134 (Fig. 3) located behind the end face 128, which shoulder is brought into the path of travel of the stud 126 on the latching lever 12? when the end face 128 is removed therefrom. 
 At the beginning of the next operation, the actuator 62, 63, carrying the rack 64, advances in clockwise direction 1), the rack 64 forcing the transfer segment 125 and the transfer latching lever 127 ahead of it, so that the stud 126 of the latching lever rides towards the end face 128 of the transfer stop arm 129 until it finally escapes past the end of the stop arm 129, which is then free to be restored to its normal position. 
 The means which restoresthe units transfer stop arm is identical with that which is shown in the patents and application heretofore mentioned to restore the transfer stop arms therein shown, and comprises a restoring spider 149 (Fig. 12) journaled on the hollow stud 68 concentrically with the actuator 62, 63 and the driving segment 76. 
 A stud 1149 on one arm of the restoring spider 149 extends laterally into the path of a face 85 on a suitably journaled driving segment 86 identical with the units driving segment 76 and located to the right thereof. 
 Cams 87 on the drive shaft 79 rock a lever 88 connected b a link with the driving segment 86 to roc the latter. 
 As the driving segment 86 approaches the end of its initial or clockwise stroke, the face thereof strikes the stud 1149 on the spider 149 to rock the latter and cause an arm 1490 thereof to strike the depending body of the transfer stop arm 129 and rock the stop arm counter-clockwise to restore'the stop arm to normal, against the tension of the spring 133. 
The stop arm 129, on its return to normal, 
brings the intermediate shoulder 137 of its slot 138 above the stud 135 of the catch 136 whereupon a coiled spring 141 (Fig. 1) encircling the stub shaft 139, snaps the pin 135 of the catch 136 beneath the shoulder 137 of the slot 138 to retain the stop arm with its end face 128 in the path of the stud 126. 
 The stub shaft 139, to one end of which the catch 136 is secured, is rotatably mounted in the supporting hanger 69, a trip pawl 140 being pinned to the other end of the stub shaft. The spring 141 coiled about the stub shaft 139 and having one end secured to a stud 142 in the trip pawl 140 and the other end anchored to the supporting hanger 69, 
constantly urges the pawl 140 and the catch 136 in clockwise direction. 
 Obviously the special carry when tripped to add 1 to the units wheel of the adding set of totalizer wheels 104, will simultanemenace ously subtract a like amount from the subtracting set of totalizer wheels 105, or vice versa, thus supplying the fugitive one, so that the totalizer always registers the correct balance at the end of each of those operations of the machine during which the bal- I of a pair of laterally spaced arms 164, 166' journaled on the opposite ends of a stud 165 mounted in a flange 148 (Figs. 10 and 12) formed on and extending transversely of the free end of the slotted guide bracket 147. 
 The arms 164 and 166 lie on opposite sides, respectively, of the flange 148. A reversing gearing connects the arms 164, 166 including gears 167, 171 secured to the hubs 168, 172 of the respective arms 164 and 166, and meshing with their respective wide pinions 169 and 173, separately journaled on pins projecting from the flange 148, the pinions also being of suflicient width and so located as to mesh with each other. 
 This reversing gearing so couples the arms 164 and 166 that when either of the arms is rocked downwardly, it will actuate the reverse gearing to swing the remaining arm upwardly. 
 The control disk 116 with its tripping tooth 117 shifts axially with the adding and subtracting totalizer, so that when the subtracting Wheels of the totalizer are in line with the common actuators 62, 63, the control disk 116 and its tooth are located in line with the arm 164, as shown in Fig. 13. When the totalizer is shifted to bring the adding wheels 104 into line with the actuators, the control disk 116 and its tooth shift therewith to loigge the disk and tooth in line with the arm When the totalizer is moved into engagement with the actuator racks 64, by mechanism well known in the art, which is not described herein, reference being made to the above mentioned patents therefor, the tripping tooth 117 is moved into co-operative relation with either the arm 164 or the arm 166, depending upon which set of totalizer wheels 104 or 105 is selected for engagement with the act aator racks 64. 
 If, after the negative totalizer wheels 105 have been shifted into engagement with the actuator racks 64, an amount, as 96, greater than the amont, as 54, already registered on the positivewheels, is accumulated on the negative wheels,'the positive wheels 104 are turned backwardly past their zero posi tions to their 9 positions. As the positive wheel 104 of the highest order (Fig. 13) passes from its zero to its 9 position, the 
tooth 117 (Fig. 8) on the disk 116 rigidlyconnected thereto, turns in clockwise direction and wipes over the finger 180 projecting upwardly from the arm 164 to cam this arm downwardly in clockwise direction. The arm 164, through the train of reversing gears, rocks the arm 166 upwardly in counter-clockwise direction. The arm 164, carries a lateral stud 163 on its free end, embraced by a slot in a bell crank 161 pivoted at 162 on the flange 148 of the guide bracket 147. As thearm 164 rocks downwardly in clockwise direction it rocks the bell crank lever 161 counter-clockwise to swing the arm 181 thereof from the full-line position shown in Fig. 8, to the dotted-line position there shown. 
 A transmitting shaft 151 j ournaled in ears forming part of the totalizer and frames 112, 
- 113 (Figs. 3, 8, 9 and 13) carries an arm 159 at that end adjacent the totalizer of highest value, which arm extends into proximity to the bell crank lever 161 and is provided with studs 160 disposed one on each side thereof. 
 Since the transmitting shaft 151 shifts axially with the adding and subtracting totalizer, it is necessary to provide these oppositely projecting studs 160 so that one or the other thereof will enter the path of the arm 181 of the bell crank 161 depending upon which side of the adding and subtracting totalizer is alined with the common actuators 62,63. 
When the totalizer is engaged with the actuators, the appropriate stud 160 on arm 159 enters the path of the arm 181 of the bell crank 161, as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 8, so that as the adding wheel 104 of highest order with its disk 116 turns reversely 1 through zero, to cause the tooth 117 of the disk to rock the bell crank 161, the arm 181 of the bell crank wipes the stud 160 on the transmitting shaft 15i1 to rock the shaft in counter-clockwise direction. 
 A second arm, 150 (Figs. 3 and 13) is fast on the shaft 151 at a point adjacent the units actuator 62, 63, the arm being forked to embrace a in 152 on a disk 145 journaled on the totalizer shaft 106, and held in position by a collar 175 fast on the shaft. 
 When the totalizer is engaged with the actuators 62, 63, a trippin tooth 144 on the trippin disk 145 normafiy assumes a position (sliown indotted lines, Fig. 3) adjacent an car 143 onthe free end of the tripping arm 140 fast on the stub shaft 139 which supports the catch 136. 
 A spring 153 (Fig. 3) connected to a stud 154 .on the arm 150 and to a stud 155 on the totalizer end frame 112, normally holds the shaft 151, with its arms 150 and 159, and the tripping disk 145 in the positions shown in Figure 3. The spring 153 also restores these parts to their normal positions near the end of the operation. The stud 155 (Fig. 3) limits the clockwise movement of the arm 150 and consequently of the shaft 151 and its arm 159. 
 Immediately after the arm 181 (Fig. 8) has passed the stud 160 and has assumed the position shown by dotted lines, the spring 153 (Fig. 3) rocks the arm 150 and shaft 151 clockwise until the arm 150 is arrested by the stud 155. This restores the shaft 151, its appended mechanism and the disk 145 to their normal positions. A stud 182 on a spring-urged pawl 183 (Fig. 8) cooperates with either of two notches formed in the, 
bell crank lever 161 to aline said lever in either of its two positions. 
 Assuming, as heretofore, that the tripping tooth 117 has wiped over the finger 180, depressing the arm 164 and raising the arm 166 through the reversing gear, the arms remain in such positions, being held against accidental displacement by the engagement of the pawl 183 with a notch in the bell crank 161, until during some subsequent operation of the machine, the adding totalizer wheel 104 of highest denomination passes through zero in the opposite direction, whereupon the arm 1810f the bell crank which has remained in the dotted line position shown in Fig. 8, will be restored to the full line position shown in such figure, during which travel it will rock the shaft 151 against the tension of its returning spring 153 (Fig. 3) to again trip the units transfer mechanism. I 
 Referring to Fig. 3, the tripping tooth 144 on the substantially circular lever-145 is brought to the position shown by dotted lines, as the totalizer wheels are engaged with the actuator racks 64. Now, when the shaft 151 is rocked counter-clockwise by the tooth 117 as just described, it also rocks'the arm 150 counter-clockwise, and, due to the pin and slot connection 152, rocks the lever 145 clockwise about the shaft 107. On this clockwise movement, the tooth 144 on the lever 145 wipes the ear 143 on the pawl 140 to rock this pawl, the stub shaft 139 and the tripping arm 136 counter-clockwise to remove the stud 135 on the trip arm 136 from the shoulder 137 on the transfer stop arm 129, whereupon the spring 133 rocks the transfer stop arm 129 clockwise until it is arrested by contact of the upper wall of the slot 138 with the stud 135, in which position the shoulder 134 is in the path of the square stud 126 on the latch lever 127. 
 Now, as the actuators 62, 63 return to their normal positions while the totalizer wheels are engaged therewith, the transfer segment 125 for the units denomination is permitted to continue its counter-clockwise movement one step further, or, until the square stud 126' contacts the shoulder 134 on the arrest ing lever 129, which arrests the units transer segment. When this occurs, the latching lever 127 rocks clockwise to disengage its stud 131 from the projection 132 on the units actuator. At this time, the transfer segment 125-has moved one additional step in a counter-clockwise direction, and has thereby advanced the negative totalizer wheel of the units order one step to accumulate thereon the single unit known as the fugitive 1. 
The-negative totalizer wheels now reg1ster the correct negative balance. 
An example of the above operation will now be given to assist in the comprehension of the mechanism involved. 
 Since the wheels 105 forming the subtracting side of the adding and subtracting totalizer at all times register the complement, less one of the amount'registered on the adding wheels 104, let it be assumed that the two sets of wheels register: 
Positive 00250.00 Negative 99749.99 
.addin the amount, $255.00, to be subtracted, 
onto t e negative totalizer wheels. 
 In the machines of the prior art referred to, the totalizer wheels would now stand at: 
Positive 99995.00 Negative 00004.99 
 However, in the present invention, when the amount of $255.00 was added onto the negative totalizer wheels 105, the highest order negative wheel 105 was advanced from its 9 to its 0 position, thereby causing the positive wheel 104 of this order, and consequentIy the tooth 117 rigidly connected thereto, to pass from its zero position to its 9 posi: tion, which, as above described, rocks the arm 164 clockwise, and through the transmitting shaft 151, trips the units transfer device, causing the units order negative totalizer wheel 105, now engaged with the actuator, to advance one step. At the end of the operation, the totalizer wheels register the folowing: 
Positive wheels 99994.99 Negative wheels 00005.00 
which latter amount is the correct negative balance. 
 With the adding and subtracting totalizer registering the above amounts, the positive wheels 104 are next selected, and an amount greater than $5.00 is added thereon. Assuming that the amount added is $10.00, as the vtainable on a positive Wheel 104 of the highest order passes from its 9 position, in which it was left, to its zero position, the tooth 117 likewise moves from its 9 position (Fig. 9) to its zero position (Fig. 8), and, since, when the positive wheels were selected for engagement with the actuator racks 64, the tooth 117 was moved into cooperative relation with the finger 184 projecting upwardly from the arm 166, the tooth 117 as it wipes the finger 184, in passing from 9 to 0, rocks this arm clockwise, and, due to the train of reversing gears coupling the arm 166 and the arm 164, the latter arm is rocked counter-clockwise, to rock the bell crank lever 161 clockwise. lhe bell crank lever'161, in turn, wipes the stud 160in the arm 159 to rock the shaft 151 counterclockwise and trip the units transfer device to cause 1 to be added onto the units positive totalizer wheel. The positive totalizer wheels now register the correct balance, that is $5.00. 
 One more example will be given to illustrate that the correct balanceis always obmachine provided with this novel device. 
Heretofore, in machinesof this type, after the negative set of totalizer elements 105 was restored to zero and, as a consequence, the positive set of wheels 104 were left standing nine, it was necessary to perform a blank operation to restore the positive set of wheels to zero before an amount could be added thereon. 
 Let it be assumed that the negative wheels 105 of the totalizer have been reset to zero. When this has occurred, the positive totalizer Wheels 104 are all standing at 9. With the totalizer standing in this position, it is desired to add an amount, let us say $12.00, on the positive side of the totalizer. In adding $12.00 to the positive wheels 104, the units of cents and tens of cents Wheels are not disturbed. The 12 is added to the units of dollars and tens of dollars wheels, advancing both these wheels to 1 and advancing the wheels to the left of the tens of dollars wheel from their 9 to their zero'positions. As the positive wheel 104 of highest order passes from 9 to zero, the tooth'l17 trips the units transfer device to add one to the positive units wheel, so that the operation will have proceeded as follows: 
Positive wheels. 99,999.99 Negative Wheels 00,000.00 
 Add 1 by units transfer to units wheel of positive set Positive wheels 00,012.00 Negative wheels The positive wheels 104 now stand at $12.00, which is the correct amount. 
 The aboveis also true when the positive set of wheels has been restored to zero and it is desired to add an amount onto the negative set of wheels. 
taking totals Means is provided in the present machine to compel the operator to take the balance from the proper set of totalizer wheels of the adding and subtracting totalizer. This means takes the form of a locking mechanism which operates in connection with the add key 41 (Fig. 4) and the subtract key 42 in such a manner that when there is a positive balance on the adding wheels 104, it is impossible to depress the subtract key 42, and when there is a true negative balance on the subtracting wheels 105, it is impossible to depress the add key 41. 
 The keys 41 and 42 when depressed, are held in such positions by means of a well known locking detent bar, not shown herein, 
but which is shown and described in the above mentioned patents, and when the keys are released near the end of the operation, they return to their normal positions under the influence of springs, not shown. 
 The locking device to compel the operator to take a balance from the proper set of totalizer wheels, is operated by the means which trips the transfer device for the units totalizer Wheels, and is controlled by the wellknown total control lever 39 (Fig. 2). 
 One form of such locking device includes a locking sector 185 (Fig. 4) carried by an arm 186 pivotally mounted on a stud 187 in the supporting hanger 69 and a similar hanger 89 (Fig. 7) omitted from Fig. 4 for clearness. The add key 41, when depressed, forces a stud 188 thereon against an inclined face 189 on the sector 185 to rock the sector and its arm 186 clockwise about the stud 187. 
 Similarly, the subtract key 42, when-depressed, forces a stud 190 thereon, against an inclined face 191 on the sector 185. The face 191 is inclined in the opposite direction from the face 189, for which reason, the subtract key rocks the sector 185 counter-clockwise i about the stud 187. 
 The sector arm 186 (Fig. 4), which, with its sector, normally occupies a neutral position, is under spring tension in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, and, as explained above, may be rocked in either direction from its neutral home position by the keys 41 or 42. Upon release of the depressedkey 41 or 42, the sector 185 and its arm 186 are restored to neutral or home position by one or the other of twosprings 201 and 202. The spring 202 holds one arm 203 of a bellcrank 204, pivoted on the stud 187, in contact with a stud 205 in the hanger 69, 
the remaining arm 211 of the bell crank 204 having a stud 206 extending across that edge of the sector arm 186 farthest from the stud 205. The spring 201 is connected to and holds the sector arm 186 in contact with the stud 206 on the arm 211 of the bell crank 204. 
 The key 42 (Fig. 4) when depressed, rocks the sector 185 and its arm 186 counter-clockwise, but, since the arm 203 of the bell crank 204 abuts against the stationary stud 205, the bell crank cannot move in a counter-clockwise direction from the position shown in Fig. 4, for which reason counter-clockwise movement-of the arm 186 tensions the spring 201, which, when the key 42 is released, restores the arm 186 and the sector 185 to neutral position, as shown. The key 41, when depressed, 
rocks the sector 185 and its supporting arm' 186 clockwise, and, since the arm 186 abuts against the stud 206 in the arm 211 of the bell crank 204, the bell crank rocks counterclockwise, thereby tensioning the spring 202, 
which, when the key 41 is released near the end of the operation, restores the sector 185, its supporting arm 186 and the bell crank 204 to'the positions shown in Figure 4. 
 Since the adding and subtracting totalizer is concealed within the machine, the operator will not know at the end of a series of addingand subtracting operations, whether the resulting balance on the totalizer is positive or negative. If it is a positive balance it will be registered on the adding wheels 104, 
whereas if it be a negative balance it will bev registered on the subtracting wheels 105. And in order to enable the operator when taking a total or sub-total of such balance, be it positive or negative, to select the proper key 41 or 42 which will set the machine so as to bring the desired set of wheels 104 or 105 into alinement with the actuators 62, 63, the adding and subtracting totalizer is arranged to control means which automatically locks against depression that key 41 or 42 which corresponds with the set of wheels which does not bear the correct balance. 
 The arm 186 (Fig. 4) has an upwardly extending projection 192 having an opening 193 (see also Fig. 6), formed of a vertical slot and a horizontal slot connected therewith, through which rojects a stud 194 on a link 195 pivoted on t e end of an arm 196 pinned to a suitably supported shaft 197 (see also Fig. 13). The stud 194 also projects through a slot 198 (Fig. 7), inone arm 199 of a bell crank 199, 200 pivoted on the stud 187. 
 The arm 200 of the bell crank, when in the position shown in Figs. 4 and 7, is normally held against movement by a stud 212 in the link 195 which seats in a notch in the hanger partway therearound in.such a manner that when the reduced'surfac'e 217 is opposite-the prong 214, the unreduced periphery of the. 
disk is inline with the prong 213,-thereby permitting clockwise movement of the arm 200, but preventing counter-clockwise movement thereof. When the locking disk 215 is rocked counter-clockwise, as will be described hereinafter, the unreduced periphery will be positioned oppositethe prong 214 and the reduced portion 217 brought to a position opposite the prong 213, thereby permitting counter-clockwise movement of the arm 200 and preventing the clockwise movement thereof. j 
 As mentioned above, the stud 212 in the link 195 normally holds the arm 200 in its neutral position and the stud 194 is normally intermediate the ends of the horizontal part of the opening 193 in the branch 192 of the sector-supporting arm 186, thereby permitting the arm to move freely in either direction independentl of the arm 200. The locking disk 215 is, therefore, ineffective to lock the keys 41 and 42 against depression on adding operations. 
When a total is to be taken from the adding and subtracting totalizer, however, it is de-- .sired to lock against, depression that key 41 or 42, which selects the totalizer wheels bearing the complement of the true balance, or, to state it another way, to enforce the depression of the key.41 or 42 which selects the'to-. 
talizer wheels on which the correct balance is registered. 
 In order to provide means for determining which tota'lizer selecting key 41or 42 shall be depressed, it is first desirable to connect the key operated mechanism, as the sector 185 and its arm 186, with the. variable locking mechanism, as the bell crank 199, 200, and further, to place the locking mechanism under control of the adding and subtracting totalizer. i 
 The connection between the key-operated mechanism and the variable locking mechanism is accomplished b first adjusting the total control lever 39 ig. 2), the body portion of which has a cam slot 220 formed therein to accommodate'a stud 218 carried on an arm 219 fast on the end of the shaft 197 which also carries the lifting arm 196 (Fig. 4) 
. The stud 218 normally lies intermediate the ends of the cam slot 220 in an enlargement thereof. The total control lever 39 when shifted in either direction from its normal in termediate or add position causes the wall of the cam slot 220 torock the arm 219 and its shaft 197 in clockwise direction (Fig. 2) to rock the arm 196 clockwise and draw the link 195 upwardly, thereby displacing the locking stud 212 (Fig. 7) from its seat in the hanger 89, and positioning the connecting stud 194 in the vertical branch (Fig. 6), of the inverted T-shaped slot 193 formed in the arm 192 connected to the sector-supporting arm 186. The connecting stud 194 when thus-adjusted is still embraced by the slot 198 (Fig. 7), in the arm 199 of the bell crank 199, 200. 
 The variable locking mechanism is controlled by the adding and subtracting totalizer by extending the transmitting shaft 151, rocked by the tripping disk 116 (Fig. 8) and tooth 117, beyond the totalizer of lowest order (Fig. 13) to a point adjacent the locking disk 215. An arm 236 (see Figs. 4 and 5) fast on the'shaft 151 carries a stud 235 which, in the normal idle positions of the parts, lies apart from the locking disk 215, as shown, but when the totalizer wheels are engaged with their actuators 62, 63, the shaft 151 with its arm 23.6 
 finger 238 projecting radially from a disk 226 journaled on the stud 216 mounted in and projecting on both sides of the hanger 69, on which stud the locking disk 215 is journaled. 
 A gear 225 (Fig. 13), fast on the disk 226 meshes with a wide pinion 227 (Fig. 4), pivoted on. a stud 228 mounted in an ear 229 of a hanger 69, which latter meshes with a second wide pinion 222 likewise pivoted on a stud 223 on the ear 224. The lastnamed wide pinion 222 is also in mesh with a gear 221 fast on the looking disk 215 which latter also carries a radially projecting finger 237. i 
 The gears 225 and 221, and the pinions 227 and 222 constitute a reversing gear similar to that associated with the arms 164, 166 
(Fig. 8) so that rotation of the disk 226 in -moved therewith to the left to position the the plane of the finger 237- stud 235 across on thelocking1 disk 215. 
Assuming t at an amount is on the posiwheels 105 for engagement wlththe actuator racks 64, the stud 235 of the arm 236 extends aclross the, 
tive totalizer wheels 104, and, that a larger in amount is to be subtracted therefrom, the 
, totalizer is longitudinally shifted to the position shown in Fig. 13, that is, with the negative wheels 105 in line with the actuator racks 64. After the actuator racks are positioned under control of the amount keys 40 (Fig. '1), the negative wheels 105 of the totalizer are engaged therewith, such engagement positioning the stud 235 (Figs. 4, 5 and 13), of arm 236 in coy-operative relation with the finger 238 on the disk 226. The actuator racks 64 are then restored to their normal positions, thereby accumulating upon the negative totalizer wheels 105 the amount which was to be subtracted from the positive wheels 104. At the same time, the positive wheels 104 are turned backwardly. The amount-thus subtracted from the positive wheels 104 being greater than the amount already thereon, the tripping tooth 117 (Fig. 8) turns in reverse direction through the zero position, and thereby rocks; the ,arm 164, bell crank 161 and the transmittin shaft 151, as explained above. As the nger 181 on the bell crank 161 (Fig. 8) rocks the shaft 151 counterclockwise, the arm 236 (Fig. 4) and the stud 235 thereon are likewise rocked counter-clockwise, and since the stud 235 was positioned as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4, the counter-clockwise movement thereof rocks the fin er 238 and the disk 226 clockwise about t e stud 216 which, due to the train of reversing gears described above, will rock the locking disk 215 counter-clockwise to position the unmutilated periphery thereof in the path of the prong 214 on the arm 200. With the locking disk 215 in this position, the arm 200 and the arm 186 which carries the sector bar 185, are locked against movement in a clockwise direction, but since the recessed or mutilated part 217 of the disk 215 has been brought opposite the' prong 213 of the arm 200, the latter, together with the arm 186, are free to move counter-clockwise. The locking disk 215, 
therefore, locks the add key 41 4) against depression, and frees the subtract key 42. Since, on total taking operations, it is necessary to press one of the keys 41 or 42, it can be seen that with the negative balance on the adding and subtracting totalizer, 
the subtract key must be depressed in order to selectv the negative totalizer wheels 105 for restoration to zero. 
 A stud 240 (Fig. 4) on a spring-pressed ages one of two notches formed in the dlsk 226 (Fig. 5) to hold this disk and the locking disk 215 in the positions to which they are adjusted. 
 Depression of the subtract key 42 at this time forces the stud 190 thereon into contact with the inclined edge 191, as described above, to shift thesector bar 185 and the arm 186 counter-clockwise, which, due 
the stud 188 therein is forced into contact with the incline 189, which tends to rock the sector bar-185, arm 186 and arm 200 clockwise. But clockwise movement of the arm 200, and consequently of the arm 186 and sector bar 185, isp'revented by the unmutilated peripher of the locking disk 215 which now lies in the path of the prong 214. The stud 188 on the key 41 will, therefore, be arrested by the sector bar 185 in its partially depressed position, and as soon as the pressure is removed from this key, a spring (not shown) returns it to its normal position. 
 Obviously, the arm 236 on the transmitting shaft 151 operates the disk 226 and locking disk 215 each time the adding wheel 104 of highest order passes'through zero in either direction, the disks remaining in the positions to which they were last adjusted until the totalizer passes through its zero position in the opposite direction, the transmitting shaft 151 being shifted with the totalizer to I position the arm 236 adjacent the fingers 237 or 238 depending upon whether the operation is an addition or a subtraction. 7 
 And if the true balance on the totalizer is positiveQrather than negative, the parts will be positioned as shown in Fig. 4, wherein the locking disk 215p'revents depression of the subtract key 42 and permits depression of. the add key 41. 
 The spring 153 (Fig. 3) restores the transmittingshaft 151 and its arm 236 (Figs. 4 and 5) to normal after each operation of the shaft by the totalizer, rockin of the arm 236 being unobstructed by that nger 237 or 238 with which the arm is not alined. As the arm 236 rocks one of the fingers 237 in clockwise direction, the remaining finger rocks in counterclockwise direction towards but out of the plane of the arm 236. 
 Restoration of the total control lever 39 (Fig. 2) to its normal add position, returns the link 195 to itsnornial position, wherein the coupling stud 194 lies'in the horizontally extending part of the opening 193 thereby disconnecting arms 192 and 199, and the locking stud 212 again seats in the notch (F'g. 7) in the [stationary hanger 89 to enable the selective keys 41 and 42 to freely rock the arm 192 in either direction in selecting the set of adding wheels 104 or 105 to engage the actuators. This adjustmentalso enables the keys 41, 42 when depressed, to lock the total control lever 39 against operation by shifting one end or the other of the horizontal part of the opening 193 over the coupling stud 192.
