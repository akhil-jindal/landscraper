General description which is printed either a single item, or a plurality of items, together with the total thereof. Transaction keys, clerks keys and a total lever are provided for controlling the various elements of the machine, all of which is fully shown and clearly described in the above mentioned Shipley applications, and to which reference may be had for a complete understanding of the machine. 
 The machine to which the present invention is shown applied is adapted for use in places of business where it is desired to register transactions comprising a single item, transactions comprising a plurality of items with the total thereof, and where it is desired to count the number of single item transactions, 
the number of items of a multiple item transaction and the number of multiple item transactions entered into the machine. 
Keyboard The keyboard of the present machine is the same as that shown and described in the above mentioned parent application Serial No. 687,305, to which reference is hereby made for a full and clear description. Only a general description of the keyboard will be given herein. 
 The keyboard disclosed in the parent application includes four banks of amountkeys,not shown herein, a bank of clerks keys, also not shown herein, a. bank of transaction keys and 31, (Fig. 1), a key 32 for releasing the depression transaction keys, a total lever 33 (Fig. 8) for controlling the machine on totaltaking and sub-total-taking operations, and a starting bar 34 (Fig. 6). 
 The transaction keys and 31 (Fig. 1) and the transaction key release key 32 are mounted in a common frame 35 supported in the machine by cross rods 36 and 37 These keys are located near the right hand side of the machine. The keys 30 are used in entering a' transaction consisting of two or more items, known herein as a multiple item transaction. The keys. 31 are used in entering transactions comprising a single item, known herein as single item transactions. 
 Keys 30 and 31 are held in their normal positions by springs, not shown, and, when depressed, are held in such positions by a locking detent 38, supported at its upper end by a link 39 and at its lower end by a link 40. Each of the keys 30 and 31 has a pin 41 mounted therein, which co-operates with a hook 42 on the detent 38. After a key 30 or 31 has been depressed, the'detent 38 is returned to its normal position by a spring 43, at which time a hook 42 embraces the pin 41 and retains the key in its depressed position. 
 The transaction keys 30 and 31 are not released during an operation of the machine, as are the clerks keys and amount keys. The keys 30 and 31 can be released by depressing another one of the transaction keys 30 or 31, or by depressing the transaction key release key '32. This key is provided with a pin 41, 
, which co-operates with a cam edge 44 on the detent 38 to move the detent down and release the depressed transaction key. There is no hook 42 opposite the key pin 41 of the transaction key release key 32, and therefore this key will return immediately to its outward or normal position. 1 
Transaction dz'fiefehtial mechanism Associated with the bank of transaction keys is the differential mechanism (Fig. 1) 
provided for adjusting the printing mecha-' tions. 
 .This difie mechanism consists of a difierentially'inovable arm (Fig. 1') which is given-a-Wariabhmovement on each opera- .tion ot'the machine. Pinned to the shaft 51', 
which' is the main drive shaft of the machine, is a pair of cams 52, which co-operate with two rollers 53, carried by-a lever 54. The lever 54- is pivoted on a difi'erential hanger 55, supported in the machine by two rods 56. At its upperend the lever 54 is connected by means of a link 57 to a segment 58, pivotally mounted on a stud 49, carried by the hr 55. The c m 52. receive one clockwise rotanote aeraeee ter-clockwise, to its normal position. The 
segment 58 receives this invariable excursion on each operation of the machme. The arm 50 is connected to thesegment 58 by a latch '59, the foot of which engages a shoulder on the segment 58, and is held in this position by a spring 60. The latch 59 is supported on the arm 50 by a link 61 and a bell crank 62. 
carriedwith it until .an end 63 of the bell crank 62 contacts the end of the depressed key, whereupon the-bell crank is rocked counter-clockwise, to withdraw the -foot of the latch 59 from the shoulder on the segment 58, and enter a nose 64 on-the latch, in the proper notch 65 in a-plate 66, supported by one of the rods 56 and the upper end of the hanger 55. The segment 58 continues its regular excursion and on its return movement, as the shoulder thereon arrives opposite the foot of the latch, the spring 60 withdraws the nose 64 from the plate 66 and reengage the latch 59 with the segment 58. At this time a stud 67 on the arm 50 is contacted by'a surface 68 on-the segment 58 which returns the arm 50 to its normal position. 
Transaction key locking Itg's desired to lock the depressed transaction keys 30and 31 (Fig. 1) against release during the registration of the items of a multiple item transaction and until the total the segment 58 is moved up, the arm 50 is i thereof has been taken. For this reason a locln'ng mechanism is, provided, under the control of the total-taking lever 33 (Fig. 8). This locking mechanism will now be described I A releasing bar 70, (Figs. 1, 2, 7 and 9) swung at its upper end on a link 71 and at its lower-end on a link 72, is provided for the purpose of adjusting an interlock to permit the machine to be released as will here'- inafter be described. The bar 70 also controls the transaction key locking mechanism. The 
link 72, which supports the bar 70 at its 'lowerend has a notch 73 formed in its eriphery, and adapted to co-operate therewith is a yoke 74, adjacent to, and fastened to, 
a spring pulled arm 75 loosely mounted on a shaft 76, and retained in its normal position by a stud 77, carried by the differentially -movable arm 50. 
depressed, the bar 70 is cammed to'the left and down by the pin 41 on the key engaging an inclined edgei78 of the bar. This movement of the bar 70 rocks the link 72 about its pivot a distance suflicient to bring the 73 opposite the yoke 74. 
It willbe' recalled that shortly after the beginning of the operation, the arm 50 is moved up, or clockwise about its pivot. This. 
movement of the arm removes the pin 77 from the path of the arm 75 whereupon a spring 79 causes the arm 75 to rock counter clockwise, which positions the yoke 74 in the notch 73. Then as the arm 50 returns to its normal position, as described above, the stud 77 passes to the right of the arm 75, as shown in Fig. 9. 
 With the arm 75 in this position, it can be seen from Fig. 9 that the yoke 74 is in the path of the link 40, supporting the locking detent 38 at its lower end. This prevents the downward movement of the link 40 and locks the detent 38 against movement, thus preventing release of the depressed key until the arm 75 is moved to restore the yoke 74 to its normal position, free of the notch 73. This is accomplished by adjusting the'total lever 33 (Fig. 8) in a manner which will now be described. 
 After the last item of a multiple item transaction has been entered, the machine is prepared for taking the .total thereof, by moving the total leverfrom its add position to its item total position, which is a counterclockwise -movement, as viewed in Fig. 8. The lever 33 is provided with a slot 80 for giving an initial clockwise movement to the shaft 76, prior to a total-taking operation. Projecting into this slot is a pm 81, 
' carried on a lever 82, pivoted at 83. An arm 84 also pivoted at 83, is held in coactive relation with an upwardly extending arm 85 on the lever 82 by a spring 86 stretched between them. The arms 84and 85 are shaped to form a 'camslot 87 into which projects a pin 88 carried by an arm 89, pinned to the shaft 7 6. 
 The counter-clockwise movement of the lever 33 rocks the levefi 82 and consequently the arms 84 and 85 counterclockwise, which, through the slot 87 and pin 88 rocks the arm 89 and shaft 76 slightly clockwise. This movement of the shaft 76 rocks an arm 90 (Figs. 1, 7 and 9), pinned thereto, into con-' tact with a stud 91 on the arm 75, as shown farther during total taking operations to cooperate with the stud 91 to rock said arm arm 90 in contact with the stud 91, and therefore the arm '75 is rocked clockwise about its pivot, which removes the yoke 74 from the notch 73, and positions the arm 75 in the'path of the stud 77. As the arm 50 movement by a cam groove 92 (Fig. 6), J 
adapted to co-operate with a roller 93, carried on a pitman 94. The roller 93 is n0rmally held in a notch in the groove 92, and withdrawn from its effective position in the groove by the total lever, in a manner well known in the art. For a detailed description of the mechanism for withdrawing the roller 93 from the notch see Letters Patent of the United States, No. 1,242,170, granted to FL. 
Fuller .on October 9, 1917. The pitman 94 is guided by a stud 106 upon which the cam 92 is freely mounted. At its left hand end the pitman is pivoted to one end of the lever 107, pivoted on a stud supported by the side frame of the machine. At its opposite end the lever 107 is connected by a link 108 to an arm 109, pinned to the shaft 76. The cam 92 receives one counter-clockwise rotation on a total-taking operation in a manner later to be described, and which through the mechanism just described, gives the shaft 76 its second clockwise movement. 
 Mechanism is provided which is associated with the transaction differential for adjusting the selecting means for the special counters appropriate to the transaction key depressed. This mechanism includes a beam 95 (Fig. 1) pivotally mounted on the arm 50, and at its right hand end bifurcated to co-operate with a pin 96 mounted in a link 97. At its lower end the link is pivoted to an arm 98 secured to one end of the sleeve surrounding a shaft 99, carried by the side frames of the machine. At its upper end the link 97 is pivoted to an aligner segment 100, pinned to a shaft 101. A roller 102 is mounted on the lever 54 to co-operate with the beam 95 to position the beam commensurate with the transaction key 30 or 31 depressed. 
Co-operating with the aligning notches in the'segment 100 is an aligner 103, carried by a plurality of arms 104, pinned on a shaft 105. T e aligner 103 is adapted to be disengaged from the segment 100 to permit the segment to be adjusted. The mechanism for operating the aligner is neither shown nor described herein, as it forms=no part of this invention and is fully shown and clearly described in applicants above mentioned co-pendinanplication, Serial Number 608,281, filed December 21, 1922 to which reference may be had for a complete understanding thereof. 
Transaction special counters The machine is provided with nine transaction special counters (Fig. 3), one for each of the keys 30 and 31, and two for counting p I v D the number of cash and charge multiple item 112. Each pawl 113 is pivoted on a yoke 115, 
pivoted on shaft and held in engagement with the ratchet 114 by a .coil spring 116. Pivoted to the yoke 115 is a link 117 which at its opposite end carries a stud 118, to which is pivoted another link 119. The link 119 is slotted to surround a stud 120 mounted in the frame 111. operating bar 121 (Figs. 3 and 5) supported at its upper end by an arm 122 and at its lower end by an arm 123, is provided with a plurality of slots 124, one to co-operate with each. of the studs 118. The" bar 121 is given a movement to the left and down, on each operationof the machine by mechanism presently to, be described. It can be clearl seen from Fig. 5 that if an obstzguction is p aced opposite the ower end of the link 119 the downward movement "of the bar 121 will, through the slot 124 andstud 118, 
I cause the link 119 torock counter-clockwise about the stud 120 and to movethe link 117 to the left whereby the link 117 will rock the yoke 115 and the tined pawl 113 clockwise to advance itsassociated counter one step. As 
the bar 121 moves up, the parts co-operating therewith will be restored to their normal positions. 
 Obviously if no obstruction isin position opposite the end of the link 119 Figs. 3 and 5), this link will he slid idly in t c direction of its length over the stud 120 and at the same time the stud 118 will be'moved toward the bottom of the slot 124, thereby rocking the a link 117 idly about its pivot on the yoke 115. 
The mechanism mentioned above, for actuating the bar 121'will now be described. J 
 An arm 135 (Figs-3 and 4) pivoted onone of the rods 56 is bifurcated atits upper end to cooperate with a pin 125 carrie'd by a'downwardly extending finger of the arm 123. upon which one of the transaction keys de-- gment' 100, shaft 101, 
Pivoted to the.arm'135 is a link 126 carrying at its opposite end a pm 127 pro ecting into a right angle opening 128 formed in an arm ,129, pinned to a shaft 130. This shaft is given a rocking movement first counter-clockwise and then clockwise to its normal position by a cam groove 131 (Fig. 6) cut in the side ofa car 134, pinned to the main drive shaft J 51. inned to'the right hand end of-the shaft is an arm'132, to which is pivoted one end of a pitman' 133. The itman 133 at its right hand end carriw a no or pro ectmg into the K ma: 
rocks the arm 135 counter-clockwise, which in turn rocks the arm 123 supporting the operating bar. 121, clockwise, and gives to the bar 121-its reciprocating movement to actuate the special counters. -Selectz'ng the. transaction special counters The counters and 141, (Fig. 3) are actuated to count the the number of items of multiple item transactions for the item charge and item cash keys respectively. The counters 142 and .143 are for counting the number of multiple item transactions for these keys. The counters 144. are used for countin the number of sin le items registered an are selected by the eys 31. 
 As previously stated, to operate a special counter, it is necesary to place an obstruction opposite the end-of the link 119 peculiar to the counter upon which it is desired to add one. This obstruction comprises a stop 145 (Fig. 3) slidably mounted on a lever 146and spring-urged toward the stud 147 upon which the lever 146 isloosely mounted. The stop 145 is guided by studs 148 and 14$,m0unted on the lever 146, and held normally in its elfective position by 'means of a segmental cam plate 150, pivoted on the stud 147, and the per phery of which is always contacted by the inner end of the step 145 said stop being held in contact with the periphery of the segmental plate by the spring 165. 
The stop 145 is moved to select the transtioncounters commensurate with the transactioned according to the transaction keys depressed. Pinnedto. the shaft 101, near its left hand end is an arm 151, (Fig. 3), connected to the lower end of the lever 146 by a link 152. Clearly, as the beam 35 (Fig. ,1)- 
lie 
is adjusted to its various positions, depending pressed, the link 97, se arm 151, (Fig. 3), and the lever 146, will be correspondingly positioned, and will remain so positioned until another key is depressed 1 and the machine operated, whereupon'the parts ustenumerated will be moved to their new positions. The transaction-differential mechanism (Fig. 1) is shown in its 'zero or home position, to' which it returns at the end of each operation. The differenially adjust able lever 146 is shown in Fig. 3 in the position to which it is adjusted under the influ- 5 ter 142. 
121 to the left will cause the toggle formed by the links 119 and 117 to be straightened, 
which through the yoke 115 and tined pawl 113, will cause the counter wheel to advance one step. The toggles associated .with the remaining eight counters will be ineffective, as previously described, the links 119 sliding idly over the studs 120, and the studs 118 sliding idly toward the bottom of the slots 124 in the bar 121. 1 
 The counters 140 and 141 and the single item counters 144 are selected for operation by stop 145 in the manner 'just described. 
The counters 142 and 143, which count the number of multiple item transactions, are selected in a slightly different manner. It will be recalled that after the last item of a multiple item transaction has been entered, the machine is prepared for a total-taking operation by moving the total lever 33 (Fig. 8) from its add position to its item total position, which movement, as will rock the shaft 76 s ightly clockwise. 
A bell crank 155 3) pinned to the shaft 76 near its left hand end is connected by a link 1.57 to an arm 156, pivoted on the stud 147. The arm 156 is rigidly connected to the cam plate 150 by a hub. The clockwise movement of the shaft 76 will, through the bell crank 155 and the link 157, rock the arm 156 and cam plate 150 counterclockwise. As previously mentioned, near the end of the first cycle of the total-taking operation, the shaft 76 is given a second clockwise movement in a manner previously described. This second movement of the shaft 76 will cause an angle edge 158 of the arm 156 to engage a in 159, mounted in an arm 160 and rock t is arm clockwise to move a lip 161, to its'efiective position 0 posite the link 119 for the couns the operating bar 121 is moved, the end of the link 119 associated with the charge total? counter, contacts the lip 161, and as the bar 121 continues its movement, the link 117 is moved forwardly to rock the yoke 115, whereby the pawl 113 advances the counter one step. As the cam plate 150 is rocked counter-clockwise, the stop 145 influenced by a spring 165 stretched between a stud on the stop 145 and the stud 149 in the lever 146 will move from the high section 162 of the cam plate 150 to the low section 163 thereof, in which position the stop is ineffective and cannot operate the counters 140. The'pin 159 normally rests on a projection of the lever 146, being held in this position by a spring-164. I 
 The operation of the counter 143, which counts the number of multiple item cash transactions, is similar to that of the counter 142, just described. The only difference is reviously described, 
that the lever 146 is moved one position counter-clockwise by the differential mecha nism, to place the arm 160 in its proper position, relative to the link 119 of the counter 143. 
Special ao'u/nter disabliag mechanism Mechanism is provided by means of which, 
the special counter operating mechanism will be dlsabled on the first cycle of a multiple item totaltaking o eration. 
 It will be remem ered that when the total lever 33, (Fig. 8) is moved to prepare the machlne for a total-taking operation, the shaft 76 is given an initial movement in a clockwise direction. Loosely mounted on the shaft 130 is a three-armed lever 170, (Fig 3), which on its upwardly extending arm carrles a pm 171 projecting into the cam slot 172 formed in one arm of the bell crank 155. As the bell crank 155 is pinned to the shaft 76, the slot 172 by acting on the in 171, will rock the lever 170 counter-cloc wise. The lever 170 has a downwardly extending foot 173 contacting a pin 174 mounted in a lever 175 (Figs. 3 and 4). At its opposite end the lever 175 carries a pin 176 projecting into a slot in the link 126. The clockwise move ment of the lever 17 0 will, through the pin 174, rock the lever 17 5 counter-clockwise, which in turn will cause the link 126 to rock clockwise about its pivot on the arm 135 (Fig. 4) a distance sufficient to place the pin 127 in an ineffective position in the openlng 128. Just before the beginning of the second cycle of a total-taking operation the shaft 7 6 is given a second clockwise movement. The cam slot 172 in the bell crank 155 is shaped so that a second clockwise movement thereof will move the pin 171 and the lever 170 clockwise to their normal positions. A spring 177 stretched between one arm of the member 170 and the lower end of the lever 17 5, will rock this lever clockwise to its normal position which, through the pin 17 6, will move the link 126 counter-clockwise and reengage the pin 127 with a notch in the opening 128, thus effecting an operative connection to operate the special counter on the second cycle of an item total-taking operation. 
 The transaction special counter operatin mechanism is rendered ineffective when read ing or resetting the single item totalizers selected under control of the keys 31 (Fig. 1) as it is not desirable to advance the special counters 144 associated therewith on totaltaking operations. I 
 To accomplish this, an arm. 18 0 (Figs. 4 and 8) pinned to the shaft 99 near its left hand end, is. constantly urged counter-clockwise by a spring 181. The arm 186 is held in its normal position by a roller 182 (Fig. 8) carried on a lever 183 pivoted on one of the rods 56, 
lower end to engage a pin 18 5 carried by an arm186, pinned to the shaft 99. When the lever 33 is moved two steps counter-clockwise to prepare the machine for resetting the single item totalizers, an inclined edge 187 ,of the block 184 is brought opposite the roller 182 whereupon the arm 180, is rocked counter-clockwise under the influence of the spring 181, until arrested by a stud 188 projecting from the side frame of the machine. The counter-clockwise movement of the arm 180 will through its engagement with a pin 189 carried by a lever 190, rock the lever 190 counter-clockwise. The downwardly extending arm of the lever 190 engages a pin 192 mounted on the lever 175, previously described. and rocks this lever counter-clockwise, whichin turn rocks thelink 126 clockwise to remove the pin 127 from its effective position to its inefi'ective position in the opening 128 in the arm 129. The operating bar 121 will notbe affected by the movement of the arm 129 when the pin 127 is in such ineffective position. 
Totalz'zers The machine illustrated has nine totalizers (Figs. 1 and 10), arranged on three lines. The upper line contains but one totalizer, used for accumulating the total of the multiple item transactions. This totalizer is controlled by the multiple item keys 30, 
 so that during any operation of the machine with a key 30 depressed, this upper totalizer is brought into mesh with the actuators to have the amounts added thereto. A total is printed of all the items of a multiple item transaction entered into this totalizer, and therefore, this upper totalizer is rocked into engagement with the actuators to control the adjustment of the printing elements, as described in the parent application, and the totalizer is simultaneously turned to zero, as 
is well known in the art. Thus, after each complete entry of a multiple item transaction, and the total printing thereof, the upper totalizer is turned to zero, so that this totalizer will be ready for the next multiple item transaction. 
 Depression of a single item key 31, controls the totalizer engaging mechanism for the upper totalizer so that it is not engaged with the actuators during the operation of the machine, and therefore, the amounts of the single item transactions are not entered into the upper totalizer. 
 The front totalizer line has fourtotalizers (Fig. 10), used to accumulate totals for an extended period of time, for example, weekly totals. There is one totalizer on this line for each class of transaction represented by the transaction keys 30 and 31, namely,- cash, charge, received-onaccount, and paid out. 
The back totalizer line also has four totalizers thereon, one for each classification, the same as the front line, and may be used as daily totals. 
 Both the front and back totalizer lines are shifted under control of the transaction keys 30 and 31 to bring the proper totalizers into alignment with the actuators, as will be later more fully described. Both the multiple item cash key 30 and the single item cash key 31, control the front and back totalizer lines to align the cash daily totalizer and cash weekly totalizer with the actuators, so that if either one of these two keys is depressed, and the machine operated the amount of the items set up on the keyboard is added into the cash weekly totalizer on the front line and the cash daily toalizer on' the back totalizer line. The charge totalizers are selected by both the multiple item charge key 30, and the single item charge key 31. The Paid out key 31 and the Received-on-account key 31'each selects its appropriate totalizer. Thus depression of any of the transaction keys will select the appropriate totalizer on each of the front and back totalizer lines. 
 The mechanism for meshing the selected totalizer on the front and back totalizer lines with the actuator, is controlled so that the two totalizers will be moved into mesh with the actuators during every item entering operation, in order that every item entered into the machine will be entered into the appropriate totalizers. However, when taking totals, any one=of the totalizer lines can be selected by moving the total control lever 33 to the proper position. 
Each of the above totalizers includes pinions 199 (Fig. 10). These totalizers are the same t pe as illustrated in the patent to W. A. hryst, No. 1,230,864, dated June 26, 1917, and the patents to F. L. Fuller, No. 1,242,170, dated October 9, 1917, and No. 1,394,256, dated October 18, 1921. The totalizer carrying frames are illustrated in Fig. 1. As the frames are practically the same as those illustrated and described in the Fuller patents 1,242,170 and 1,394,256, onl a brief description will be given herein. ach set of totalizer pinions 199 (Fig. 10) is loose on a tube 198, carried by frames 200, 201 and 202, respectively, mounted on opposite ends of the tube andslidably mounted on shafts 203, 204 and 205, respectively. The inner ends of the frames 200, 201 and 202 are slotted to engage blocks 197 (Fig. 10) secured to the hangers 55 to prevent the frames from turning on the shafts 203, 204 and 205. The tubes 198, together with their respective frames 200, 201, or 202, form unitary structures slidable on the shafts 203, 204 or 205, for laterally positioning the pinions 199 into cooperative relation with the difi'erential segments, as is old and well known in the art and described in the Fuller patents above referred to. 
.under the control of the transaction keys 30 and 31. The mechanism for laterally shifting the totalizer lines under control of the transaction keys is as follows: 
 Connected to the arm 98 (Fig. 1), which it will be remembered is differentially positioned under control of the keys 30 and 31, 
is a segment gear 206, meshing with a rack 207 secured to a bar 208. The bar 208 is slidably mounted on two studs 209, and has a flange 210 at each end. Formed in theflanges are cam slots 212 (Fig. 10) into which project rollers 213 carried by slides 211. These slides co-operate with projections on the totalizer frames 200 and 201, to slide these frames laterally in the machine for the purpose of selecting totalizers, all of which is fully shown and described in the previously mentioned applications. 
 The cam slots 212 are duplicates and are so formed that the front and back totalizer lines move like extents simultaneously, so that corresponding totalizers are selected on the two lines. The cam slots 212 are also formed to select the same totalizer on each line when either the cash single item key 31, or the cash multiple item key 30, is depressed. The charge single item key 31, or the charge multiple item key 30, when depressed, selects the same totalizer on each line. The release ke 32 never selects a totalizer since this key 1s never held depressed while the machine is operated. There is no totalizer corresponding to the No sale key, and therefore, there are six keys in the transaction bank for selecting totalizers, and onl four total izers on each line to be selecte the cash? and charge totalizers each being selected by two keys and duplicate totalizers, one on each line, are selected during each operation of the machine. 
Operating mechanism f The machine as shown is operatedvmanually by a crank 215, whichhas integral therewith a gear 216 meshing with gear 217, which in turn meshes with the gear 134 pinned to the main drive shaft 51, previously described. The ratio of the gears is such that two clockwise rotations of the crank 215 will give onehalf of one counter-clockwise rotation of the gear 217 and one clockwise rotation to the gear 134 and the main drive shaft 51 on each adding operation of the machine. understood that during total taking operations the shaft 51 is given two complete rotations, thus requiring four rotations of the gear 216. 
 The machine may also bedriven by a motor which is not shown or described herein, as it forms no part of the invention. 
It is to be Machine release The machine is released for operation by depressing a clerks key (not shown) a transaction key 30 or 31 (Fig. 1) and a starting ,bar 34. (Fig. 6). This permits the shaft 220 to be rocked clockwise to release the machine for operation in a manner fully illustrated and described in the previously mentioned application Serial No. 687,305. 
' The shaft 220 normally tends to rock clockwise under the influence of a spring 221 com pressed between the bottom of a slot in a link 222 and the shoulders of two identical spring clips 223, pivoted on an arm 224, pinned to the shaft 220. Also pinned to the shaft 220 is an arm 225 which carries a flattened stud 226. A pawl 227 pivoted on a stud mounted in the side frame 228 of the machine normally lies in the path of the stud 226, thereby holding the shaft 220 in its normal position. Depressing the starting bar 34 will, through a stud on a slide 229 engaging a bifurcated portion of an arm 230 connected by a link 231 to a downwardly extending arm 232 of the pawl 227, rock the pawl counter-clockwise out of the path of the flattened stud 226 whereupon the spring 221 will expand and rock the shaft clockwise to release the machine. 
 An interlock between the starting bar 34 (Fig. 6) and the transaction keys 30 and 31 (Fig. 1) is provided whereby it is necessary to depress a transaction key 30 or 31 before the machine canbe released for operation by depressing the starting bar 34. 
 Pinned to the shaft 220 (Fig; 2) is an arm 235, upon which is mounted a flattened stud 236. A. projection on an interlocking pawl 237 pivoted on a shaft 238 normally lies in the path of the stud 236. The interlocking pawl 237 is held in contact with a yoke 239 by a spring 240. The yoke 239 has an upwardly extending arm 241, held in engagement with a pin 242 carried on the arm 71, supporting the release bar at its upper end. The movement of the bar 70 toward the left as the transaction key 30 or 31 is depressed, will rock the arm 71 clockwise, which through the pin 242 and the arm. 241 will rock the yoke 239 and interlocking pawl 237 counterclockwise to remove the projection on the intcrlocking pawl from the path of the stud 236 whereupon the shaft 220 is free to be released by depressing the starting bar 34. 
 Near the end of each operation it is necessary to restore the shaft 220 to its normal po sition and also to restore the release pawl 227 to its normal position in the path of the Hat tended stud 226, and to restore the projection on the interlocking pawl 237 to its normal position in the path of the stud 236. 
 Themechanism for restoring these parts, just enumerated, to their respective normal positions is best shown in Fig. 6, and includes a cam groove 245 out in the face ofthe gear 217 and into which projects a roller 246 cara 5 pin 248 engaging a notch in an opening 249 in the link 222, previously mentioned. The cam groove 245 is shaped to rock the arm 247 clockwise and back to its normal position near the end of each operation of the machine. It will be recalled that at the beginning of the operation, the arm 224 is rocked clockwise by the s ring 221, which positions the stud car ried y this arm in the top of the slot in the link 222. The clockwise movement of the arm 247, as just described, willthrough the pin 248, link 222 and arm 224, rock the shaft 220 counter-clockwise slightly past normal, whereupon the starting bar 34, pulled 1 by spring 244, will return to its normal posilllo tion, which through mechanism hereinbefore described will restore the release pawl 227 to its position in the ath of the stud 226. The shaft 220 then roc s clockwise until the stud 226 rests against the pawl, in which positions theparts are ready to be released for another operation. The interlocking pawl 237 is similarly restored to its normal POSItlOII On the total-taking operation'the machine receives two complete" operations or cycles restoration of the parts just described to their normal positions near the end of the first cycle of operation, and mechanism provided therefor will now be described. 
 Referring to Figs. 6 and 8, it will be remembered that the shaft 76 is given a preliminary clockwise movement when the total lever 33 is moved to prepare the machine for a total-taking operation. This movement of the shaft 76 through arm 109 (Fig. 6) link-v 108 and lever 107, moves the pitman 94 to the left a distance sufiicient to remove the roller '93 theredn from the notch in which it normally rests, into effective relation with the 46 cam groove 92. This initial movement of the pitman also moves a coupling plate 250 to couple the cam 92 to the gear 217 in such a manner that they will be rotated in unison. Further description of the coupling plate 50 250 is not thought necessary,as it is old and well known in the art and shown and described in'detail'in. the aforesaid Fuller patent, No. 1,242,170. At its right hand end the pitman 94 is provided with a stud 251'cooperating with a slot 252 formed in the lower end of the link 222. During the first cycle of operation of the total-taking o eration, the cam 92 will give the pitman an a ditional movement to the left which by means of the -so Sela 251 will rock the link 222 clockwise and position the opening 249 therein so as to, 
render the. pin 248 ineffective on its downward movement. During the second cycle the late 222 is restored and the shaft 220 restored as described above.
