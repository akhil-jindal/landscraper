Y., A CORPORATION OF NEW YORK ACCOUNTING MACHINE Application filed November 19, 1927. Serial No. 234,338. 
 This invention relates generally to adding and listing machines, and has particular reference to improvements in adding and listing machines of the kind which list items, ac- 
6 cumulate items into a total, and print the totals whenever desired. 
 The various ideas involved in this invention are shown in the accompanying drawings in the form they would take when embodied in a ten-key adding machine, but, as 
will be clear later on, some of the features can be used just as'well in adding machinesin which the various functions are controlled in ways other than by a ten-key keyboard. 
()ne of the objects of the invention is to i provide a simple, sturdy machine which will list items, accumulate the items into totals, and give printed totals or sub-totals, when ever desired. 
 Another object of the invention is to pro vide a machine having all of the characteris tics just stated which will perform all of its functions accurately over a long period of time with a minimum amount of adjustment or repair. 
Still another object is to provide a printing -mechanism for listing and printing totals and sub-totals which is extremely simple and eflicient, and in which the ribbon or corresponding carrier for marking material may be replaced or supplied without the trouble and inconvenience necessary to re-ink or change ink ribbons and the like used at the present time in machines now in general use. 
 Another object of the invention is to provide a machine which will perform all of the more important functions of an adding. and listing machine, but which can nevertheless be manufactured at a very low cost, with a correspondingly low selling price to the purchasing public. 
 With the foregoing and other objects in view the invention consists in a novel constructionand combination of parts, the novel features of which are pointed out in the claims and an embodiment of which suitable for illustrating the various ideas is shown in the drawings accompanying and forming a part of this specification.

 As before stated, the various ideas involved in the present invention are shown in the drawings as they would appear when embodied in a ten-key adding machine. The illustrative machine has the usual ten digit keys running from O to 9, which are operated sequentially to enter in the machine the digits makin up an item. After the item has been entere it will appear on a set of rotary indicators where it may be inspected. If found to be incorrect, an error mechanism may be brought into play and the item erased from the indicator without disturbing records which may already be contained in the machine. This error mechanism is controlled by an error kc and is actuated from a power shaft operate b a handle. 
 If the item is ound to appear correctly on the indicators it is entered in a listing mechanism and added on a totalizer. This is done by operating the power shaft. At the start of such an operation the indicators are first connected by intermediate pinions or gears to a set of item printing type wheels and the indicators then cleared, thereby transferring from the indicators to the type wheels the amount previously indicated. At the same time as t e connectionbetween the indicators and item type wheels is made, higher order type wheels which are not required in printing the significant figures are given a zero eliminating movement. Mechanism for making the printing impression then comes into play and the item is listed on a strip of paper. 
 Immediately after listing, the item type wheels are cleared, but before this occurs the item wheels are connected to a set of totalizer wheels so that the clearing movement of the type wheels causes an adding actuation of the totalizer. This totalizer may have indicators for displaying the total of amounts, but it is preferred to provide them with type for printing the totals. 
 The connection between the item type wheels and the totalizer elements is effected by engaging the totalizer with a set of pinions mounted on supports which are independently movable under the control of the totalizer elements, after the connection is established, to cause the pinions to effect a car rying movement from one totalizer element to the element of next higher order. 
 After all of the items of a series have been entered on the totalizer, the amount of the total may be printed and the totalizer cleared, or, if other items are to be added, the total may be printed and allowed to stand. 
 In the illustrative machine a. single platen is used for listing items and for printing subtotals and totals. It is normally in print ing relation with the item type Wheels and is given a printing movement at each opera tion of the main operating mechanism. When it is desired to print a total or sub-total, however, the platen is moved by means of a handle to printing relation with the totalizer wheels, movement of the handle also causing a total printing operation of the platen. 
 Associated with the totalizer wheels is a mechanism which normally serves to align and hold the totalizer elements against accidental displacement. When the total is printed this mechanism is actuated under the control of the totalizer elements to give such higher order elements as stand at zero, a zero eliminating movement. As a result, only the signlificant digits will appear in the printed tota The items and the totals or sub-totals are printed in different colors. The ink or corresponding material is carried by an ink ribbon which has none of the usual feeding and reversing mechanisms. In the form shown in the drawings it is a two-color ribbon of sufiicient len th to cooperate with the entire impression ace of the platen. It is fastened in a frame which keeps it straight'and is carried in a rectangular opening in a plate which shifts with the platen when the platen is moved to total printing position. The ribbon and its supporting frame rest upon a slide and the rectangular opening in the shifting plate is enough larger than the ribbon frame to permit a movement of the plate relative to the frame and ribbon, but after the relative movement is effected the ribbon and plate move together. Normally the ribbon frame andribbon rest with one of the color bands opposite the item printing type wheels. When the total printing operation is started, thecshifting plate moves approximately the width of a color band before it picks up the ribbon, the result being that when the ribbon reaches a position opposite the total printing type wheels the other color band will be opposite the platen so as to print totals or subtotals in a distinctive color. 
 It has been found that a properly constructed and treated ink ribbon of the kind described will give a surprisingly large number of impressions. However, when the supply of ink is used up, the frame and its ribbon may be lifted out and a new one dropped into place. 
 The machine in the drawings also has a repeat mechanism whereby the same amount may be repeatedly entered in the listing and totalizing mechanism. This mechanism comprises a control key which may be latched down and which maintains a connection be tween the item type wheels and indicators so that when the operating-handle is actuated and the type wheels cleared to actuate the totalizer, the item will also be restored to the indicators. As a result the indicators are ready to initiate another sequence of item printing and adding operations at the next operation of the operating handle, thereby making it unnecessary to readjust the indicators by means of the digit keys. 
 The machine shown in the drawings will now be described in detail. 
Referring to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, the frame work of the machine comprises a base 10 towhich are attached side plates 11 and 12. These frames 11 and 12 are tied together by plates 15 and 16, and by a shaft 104. The plate 15 supports the outer ends of numeral keys 50, an .error key 215 and the repeat key 261. The plate 16 supports a printing slide and printing mechanism described later on, and acts as a guide for a total printing lever 191 and a total reset lever 192. Notches 292 (Fig. 11) and 293 in the forward ends of slots 290 normally hold these levers in forward or home position. The base 10 and plates 11 and 12 also support a cabinet, which is made in one piece, and which slides down over the plates 11 and 12 and rests on base 10, bein held there by screws (not shown). 
The p ates 11 and 12 are supports for the. 
several shafts upon which are mounted the different units of the -mechanism. 
32 upon the faces of. which are the numerals Q to 9 inclusive. There is a hole 33 (Fig. 6) in each wheel normally engaged by a drive stud 34 fastened to a drive arm 35 secured to drive sleeve 36 mounted loosely on the shaft 31. The length of the stud 34 is equivalent to the combined width of the item wheels 30 to normally lock them in their home positions as best shown in Fig. 4. There is a drive gear 37' also fast to sleeve 36. Pivoted to each wheel 30 is a pawl 38 spring pressed toward shaft 31 and which will cooperate with the spline to turn wheels which have been moved to the left of home position back to zero position when shaft 31 is rotated by a segment 20 through its drive cam 25 fast to a main shaft 70. 
 Supported in the side plates 11 and 12, under shaft 31, is a worm shaft 40 upon which, slidably mounted, is a frame 41 (Fig. 2 1) which is a formed steel piece, having cars 44 and 45, surrounding the drive shaft 40. T hese ears move the wheels 30 laterally when the frame 41 is moved by rotation of worm shaft 40, the worm part 40 working in nut 46 which is part of frame 41. The worm shaft 40 is rotated in one direction by a spring motor hereinafter described when the motor is released by numeral keys, and in the other direction when the spring motor is returned to home position by operation of a main actuating lever 253 and the shaft 70. 
These indicating wheels 30 are turned to be visible through an opening in the cabinet. 
 The indicators are then connected to a set of item printing wheels 120 by intermediate connecting gears 126, and on being turned back to zero position by rotation of the shaft 31 (by the segment 20) they will, through the intermediate connecting gears 126, turn the item printing wheels 120 to printing position. Thus the indicator wheels 30 are first used to indicate the item to be printed and added and are then used to turn item printing wheels 120 to printing position. The item is then printed from these wheels 120, after which they are disconnected from the indicator wheels 30, which are then slid to the right or home position by movement of frame 41 through worm shaft 40, and reengaged with drive stud 34. 
 The resetting mechanism for the item indicating wheels (Figs. 2, 4, 5, 24 and 25) includes the segment lever 20 loosely mounted on the shaft 21. The segment part meshes with a pinion 22 fast to the indicator wheel shaft 31. The lower arm 23 of the segment has two rolls 24 working on the cam 25 fast to main shaft (Figs. 2, 4 and 25). Thus upon the forward stroke of the operating lever 253 and rotation of the shaft 70, the segment arm 20 will be rocked forward and, through the pinion 22, will turn the shaft 31, nine-tenths of a revolution backward and, through spline in shaft 31 contacting with return pawls 38 pivoted to wheels 30, will return these wheels 30, which have been positioned to indicate an item, to zero position, and through the intermediate gears 126 willturn the item printing wheels 120 backward to printing position corresponding to the item indicated. 
 Stud 20 (Figs. 2, 4 and 24) projects from the part 23 of segment arm 20 into a cam slot 26 (Fig. 24) of a stop pawl 27 loosely mounted on the shaft 70. A bent over portion 28 of the pawl 27 projects across the retaining pawl 76, also mounted loosely on the shaft 7 O, and which by its upper end 78 working in teeth of a ten-toothed disk 92, fast to control shaft 90, holds said shaft 90 in the positions in which it has been stopped by the upper ends 52 (Fig. 22) of the amount keys 50. Vhen segment lever 20, is rocked to return the positioned indicator wheels 30 to zero position, it will, through this constructlon, rock forward both stop pawl 27 and retaining pawl 76, thus releasing shaft 90 and allowing it to rotate by spring motor until stopped in its home position by pawl 27 contacting with the stop arm 27. This returns the operating stud 34 to home position, by which time all wheels 30 will also have been turned to zero, with the holes 33 in line with the drive stud 34, so that when the worm shaft 40 is rotated backward by forward movement of operating lever 253 it will, through worm 40. nut 46, and frame 41, force all wheels 30back on the stud 34, ready to be again used to indicate another item. On the backward or return stroke of operating lever 253, segment lever 20 will also be rocked backward and, through above connections, will rock backward, the stop pawl 27, and allow spring 77 to return the retaining pawl 76 to its normal position, thus holding control shaft 90 in zero position as shown. 
 The numeral key mechanism comprises a group of ten keys 50 numbered from 0 to 9 inclusive, pivoted on the main shaft 70. The 
forward ends of the keys are guided in a rib .51 of the base frame 10, which rib is milled to receive the keys and drilled for springs 51 which act to keep the forward ends of the keys elevated. Each key 50 has an upwardly extended arm 52 (Fig .22) hooked at its end, 
i which cooperates with spirally arranged stop fingers 91 fast to the control shaft 90. These stop fingers 91, ten in number, contacting with the hooked end 52 of depressed key 50, sto the control shaft 90 in a (position correspon ing to the key depresse Pivoted to each upper arm 52 of the keys 50 is a double arm 53, spring pressed forward against a stationary locking rail 54 which is fastened to the base 10 o the machine. When any key 50 is forced down to release shaft 90 and bring its hooked end in the path of a stop finger 91, the end 55 of arm 53 will drop over the edge of rail 54 and hold the key 50 depressed until the bent outer end of sto arm 91, contacting with the upper end 56 0 arm 53, rocks said arm counterclockwise separating it from the locking rail 54, thereby releasing the key 50 and allowing it to be raised by its spring 51' to home position. 
 Each key 50 also has a rearwardly projecting arm 57 which rests on a milled surface of the base 10 and forms a stop for the key. This end 57 is rounded on its top edge 58, and works in slotted tie piece 60 (Fig. 15) fast to the side plates 11 and 12, and between key hangers 61 pivoted to the piece 60. These key hangers 61 are so shaped on their lower ends and so hung that there is only room enough for one key end 57 to pass up between them. With this construction one key only can be operated at a time and it will be latched down as previously described until the control shaft 90 and the driven indicating wheel 30 has reached a position corresponding to the key depressed. 
 \Vhen any key 50 is depressed it will force down a bail 71 which is loosely mounted on the shaft 70. This will rock a double escapement 7 2 (Fig. 5) against its spring 73. This escapement 72 controls the worm shaft 40 in shifting the indicating wheels 30 laterally mounted on splined shaft 31, through a gear train and stop finger 74 fast to pinion 7 5 and both mounted loosely on shaft 90. Vith this construction when any key 50 is depressed the indicating wheels 30 are moved to the left one-half a space by the worm shaft 40, and when the depressed key 50 is raised by its spring 52 the indicating wheels 30 will be moved to the left the balance of a space, that is, a total distance equal to the width of one wheel. The bail 71 also depresses the single escapement 76 (Figs. 2 and 24) against its spring 77, withdrawing the nose 78 from engagement with the tooth of disk 92 fast to control shaft 90 and allowing the shaft to rotate until stopped by the upper end 52 of depressed key 50. This rotary movement will cause the drive stud 34 to turn wheels 30'to indicate the figure of the key depressed. Thus when the keys 50 corresponding to the digits in the item to be added have been depressed, one at a time, the indicating wheels 30 will successively be so positioned that the item will be visible through the opening in the cabinet. The 
main operating lever 253 can then be pulled, which will print and add this item and return the parts to home position ready to print and add another item, or the amount, if incorrect, may be erased without affecting records already in the machine by calling into play an error mechanism subsequently described. 
 The motor used to rotate the item indicating wheels to positions corresponding to thd number on the key depressed is shown principally in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 24. It comprises a drive segment 100 loose on a shaft 101 and driven forward by a spring 105 fast to rear arm 106 of the segment 100 and to the rod 104. The segment 100 meshes with a pinion 110 fast to a ratchet disk 111, both being loosely mounted on a stud 102 riveted to the side plate 12; This ratchet disk 111, through a pawl 113 fast to gear 112, drives the gear 112 one way when disk 111 is rotated counterclockwise but will not drive it when the disk is rotated clockwise to home position. 
 The gear 112 meshes with the drive gear 37 fast to the sleeve 36, which sleeve is loosely mounted on the shaft 31 and carries the stud 34 for setting the wheels 30. The gear 112 also meshes with a pinion 93 (Fig. 5) fast to the control shaft 90. This shaft is normally prevented from being turned by gear 112 by nose 78, of single escapement 7 6, Figs. 2 and 24, contacting one of the teeth of the ten-toothed disk 92 fast to the shaft 90. When a numeral key 50 is depressed, this nose 7 8, through the rocking of bail 71, is withdrawn from under the tooth of the above disk 92 and the segment 100, actuated b. its spring 105, and acting through the above described gearing, will turn the shaft 90 and sleeve 36 forward until stopped by the hooked arm 52 of the depressed key 50. As the drive stud 34 is rigid with the arm 35 and sleeve 36, and as the item indicating wheels 30 are on stud 34, the turning of the segment will turn all the item indicating wheels 30 forward to the figure on the key depressed. They are held in this position by the escapement arm 7 8, which is rocked back to holding position by its spring 77 P when the key 50 is raised by its spring 51'. By this construction, at the down stroke of any key 50 the item indicating wheels 30 that are on the drive stud 34 are all turned to the figure corresponding to the figure on the key operated. The motor is restored to home position during the last half of the forward stroke of the operating lever 253 by means of a link 108 (Fig. 5) cooperating with a stud 109 fast on a lower arm of segment 100, and connected to an arm 107 fast to the main operating shaft 70. This restoring vmovement of the motor takes place after the printing of the item from wheels 120, that printing occurring during the first half of the forward stroke of actuating lever 253. 
 The sprin motor or drive to slide the item indicating w eels to proper decimal positions corresponding to the positions of the digits in the items is best shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. Mounted on the shaft 101'is a drive se ent 1011 driven forward by spring 1051 ast to a rear arm 1061 of the segment and to the rod 104. This se ment1011 meshes with a pinion 103 fast oa gea'r 1041 loosely mounted on the stud l02. EThis gear 1041 meshes with a pinion 47 fast to the worm shaft 40 and with pinion 75 fast to stop arm 74 loosely mounted on the control shaft 90. Spring 1051 is normally held from driving by the double escapement 72 cooperatin with a stop arm 74 (Fig. 5). It is released y the depression of any key 50 which, through the bail 71, rocks the escapement 72 forward, thereby carrying its front arm from under the stop arm 74 and bringing its rear arm into the path of movement of the stop arm 74.' This allows the above gear train to turn shaft 40 about onehalf of a revolutionand, through the worm 40 and nut 46 carried by the frame 41, the 
' indicating wheels ,30 will be moved over to the stroke of depressed key 50 the double escapement is rocked rearward by its spring 7 3 disengaging the rear arm from the stop arm 74 and moving the front arm into the path of the stop arm 7 4. This allows the above gear train to turn said shaft 40 the balance of one revolution and moves the wheels 30 to the left, the balance of a wheel space. This last movement of the wheels 30 carries the left hand wheel 30 off of the drive stud 34 and into engagement with a liner-1111 (Figs. 4 and 6) on the item type wheel frame 123. This liner 1111 in its normal or lower position keeps all of the indicator wheels 30 that have been forced off stud 34 in alignment so they will mesh correctly with intermediate gears 126 when the latter are moved to connect the indicators and item type wheels. This operation is repeated as many times as there are figures in the item to be added. 
 The motor 1011 is also restored to home osition by the forward stroke of the operating lever 253, through a link 1081 cooperating with a stud 1091 fast to the lower arm of the segment or motor 1011 and pivoted to the arm 107 fast to the main shaft 7 0. This restoring movement takes place after the printing of the item from the wheels 120, which printing as before stated occurs during the first half of theforward stroke of lever 253. 
 The item printing type wheels and their connections will next be described. Referring to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, it will be seen that there are eight of these wheels 120, loosely mounted on a shaft 121, one end of which is supported in the side plate 11 and the other end in a bracket 122 fast to the upper tie plate 16. These wheels 120 are held on a frame 123 which is pivoted on the shaft 121. They are the same in size and construction as the wheels 30, except that they are narrower and the figures are raised for printing instead of being engraved for readin They also have return pa'wls 124 pivote to them. These pawls engage with a spline 1n the shaft 121 to return the wheels to zero when the shaft 121 is rotated nine-tenths of a revolution forward. The shaft is rotated by a segment 131 (Fig 2) operated by the forward stroke of operating lever 253 by a cam 135 fast to the main shaft 70. 
 Loosely mounted on a short shaft 125 supported in the frames 123 are intermediate connecting gears 126 for connecting the item indicating wheels 30 and item printing wheels 120 and driving said wheels 120 to printing position when the indicating wheels 30 are returned to zero position by the rotation of shaft 31. Also mounted on a shaft 127 in the frame 123 are a series of detent arms 128, one for each gear 126, to the upper ends of which are pivoted detent rolls 129 acting on the teeth of the gears 126, thereby holding them and the type wheels 120in proper pos1 tion at all times. As so far described, the item printing wheels 120 normally are in such a position that the figures on top are ust ahead of printing position. Rocking of the frame 123, to connect the indicating wheels 30 with the item printing wheels 120, slightly rotates the wheels 120 backward, thereby bringing the printing figures on said wheels directly over the center of the shaft 121 in the proper position for printing. This is caused by the rolls 129 holding the intermediate gears 126 and wheels 120 in alined position so that the rocking frame 123 will turn the printing wheels 120 slightly backward directly under a printing platen 295. 
 The frame 123 is rocked by a lever 240 (Figs. 2, 4 and 27) mounted on the shaft 21. The lower arm of this lever 240 has a roll 241 which acts with a cam 242 fast to the main shaft 70. With this construction, when the main operating lever 253 starts on its forward stroke the frame 123 is rocked, thereby connecting the item printing wheels 120 with the item indicating wheels 30, and when these wheels 30 are turned back home by rotation of their shaft 31 the printing wheels 120 will be turned to printing position and the printing effected. This will be done in the first half of this forward stroke, after which the frame 123 will be rocked backward by its spring 130. 
 The foregoing assumes that the movement of the arm 240 is always transmitted to the frame 123, but this is not the case. The movement of the arm is transmitted to the frame through a link 243, which may, as hereinafter described, be moved to disconnect the arm and frame so as to prevent movement of the frame by the power shaft 7 0. 
 The mechanism for clearing the item printing wheels is shown in detail in Figs. 2 and 4. It comprises a segment lever 131 loosely mounted on the shaft 21 and having a toothed portion which meshes with a pinion 132 fast to the return shaft 121. The lower arm 133 has two rolls 134 working on a cam 135 fast to the main shaft 70. Upon the forward stroke of operating lever 253 and oscillation of shaft 7 0, the segment lever 131 will be rocked backward and, through the pinion 132, will rotate the shaft 121 ninetenths of a revolution forward, and throu h the spline in shaft 121, working with t e pivoted pawls in wheels 120, will turn these wheels 120 back to zero or home position. This resetting movement of these wheels acts through intermediate transfer gears 141 to add on the total printing type wheels 160 the amount cleared from the item type wheels 120. This operation occurs on the last half of the forward movement of the operating lever 253. On the back stroke of said lever, the segment lever 131 and, through it and pinion 132, the shaft 121 will be returned to home position, leaving the item printing wheels 120 at zero or home position. 
 The total printing mechanism (Figs. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 26) includes eight of the total printing wheels 160 which are the same in construction as the item printing wheels 120. They also have pivoted awls which are spring pressed into a spline in a shaft 162 upon which they are loosely mounted, said shaft being supported in a frame 163 pivoted on the shaft 170. Each wheel 160 has fast to it a disk 171 carrying a projecting transfer tooth 169 and in which is a control notch 172 used in connection with the zero elimination mechanism to be described later. 
 As stated above, the total printing wheels 160 are mounted in a frame or bail- 163 which is U-shaped and is mounted loosely on the shaft 170. The frame has a lower extension 164 on which is pivoted a roll 165 (Figs. 2 and 26), cooperating with a cam 166 fast to the main shaft 70. Normally these wheels 160 are not connected to the item printing wheels 120, but after the item has been printed from the wheels 120 and as they are being disconnected from item indicating wheels. 30 the total printing wheel frame 163 is rocked forward byits cam 166, thereby bringing the wheels 160 into mesh with the intermediate transfer gears 141. This connects them to the item printing wheels 120 so that when these wheels 120 are returned to zero position they will turn the total printing wheels 160 forward and thereby add to them the item printed from wheels 120 and indicated on wheels 30. 
The transfer or carrying mechanism controlled by the teeth 169 includes the arms 140, one for each of the wheels 160 mounted on the shaft 121. Pivoted to these arms 140 are the gears 141 meshing with the item printing wheels 120. These transfer arms 140 are held in elevated position by trip arms 142, the upper ends of which rest under offset portions 144 of the arms 140 by tension of springs 143. The center of the intermediate transfer gears 141 is about one-half of a tooth space above a line passing through the center of item printing wheels 120 and total printing wheels 160, and when an arm 140 is released and pulled down by its spring 143 it will come to rest about one-half of a tooth space below the imaginary line. The tripped arms are stopped and held in this lower position by the offset portions 144 of arms 140 contacting with the stops 145 of trip arms 142. 
 There is an angular offset portion 146 on each of these trip arms 142 positioned in the path of travel of transfer teeth 169, so that when any wheel 160 passes from 9 to 0 this transfer tooth 169 contacts with offset portion 146 of trip arm 142, forcing the arm back against spring 143, thus unlatching transfer arms 140 and allowing them to drop until stopped by step 145 of arms 142. When any of these arms 140 are pulled down pass ing from upper to lower position the transfer gear 141 will turn its corresponding total wheel 160 one tooth space, as when this occurs, these wheels 160 are in mesh with the transfer gears 141. If the total wheel is be ing turned by its transfer gear at the time of dropping its transfer arm 140, the wheels 160 will be given one extra tooth of revolution owing to the extra turning of transfer gear 141 causedby the movement of the arm 140 about the center of shaft 121. As a result, when a total wheel 160 passes from 9 to 0 the next higher total wheel 160 will be advanced one extra tooth, that is, one extra number will be added. 
 After the completion of the adding movement the total printing wheel frame 163 is rocked backward by its spring 170, carrying the total printing wheels 160 out of. mesh with the intermediate transfer gears 141. On the backward stroke of the operating lever 253 the restoring bail 171 will be elevated by a cam 171?) on the main shaft forcing the transfer arms 140 upward to the positions where they will be latched ready to be again tripped at the next operation of the machine. Normally this bail 171 is in raised position under all the transfer arms 140, but on the forward stroke of operating lever 253 the bail 171 will fall or be forced down by the dropping of any transfer arm 140 that may be unlatched' by a transfer tooth 169. 
 As previously stated in a more or less general way, both the item type wheels and the total wheels have associated with them zero eliminating mechanism operating to prevent 120, the wheels 120 still remaining in line with the bent portion 50 of piece 49 will be turned about one-half of a space, thereby taking the zeros out of printing position. Thus the zeros to the left of the last figure, or to the left of the highest adjusted wheel of the item type wheels, will not be printed on the paper. lVhen the frame 123 is rocked back to home position the detent rolls 129 return the wheels 120 to normal or home position. 
 The zero eliminating mechanism for the total printing wheels (Figs. 2, 8, 6, 7, 8 and 18) employs a set of arms 180 loosely located on the shaft 181 of the U-shaped frame or bail 182 pivoted on shaft 101. There is one of these arms for each of the total printing wheels 160. They have a forward offset nose 183 which works in the teeth of the total wheels 160. W hen a total is printed from these wheels 160 the arms 180 turn the wheels that are at the left of the highest figure to carry the zeros away from the printing position. For this purpose each arm 180 carries a finger 184 cooperating with one of the notches 172 in the disks 171a fast to the sides of the total Wheels, the arrangement being such that when the zero is in printing position the notch 172 is directly in line with the finger 184 of arm 180. WVhen a total is being printed a U-shaped frame 187 will be rocked forward, carrying a shaft 186 (Figs. 2 and 8) from under the rear portion 188 of the arm 180, allowing the arm 180 to be rocked upward by its spring 189 and cans ing the hook-shaped end 184 to enter the notch 172. The upper offset nose 183 being in a tooth space of the wheel 160, its upward movement will turn the wheel forward to carry the zero away from the printing position. The arms 180 also have a bent portion 190 which underlies the arm 180 of the next higher order so that the lower order wheels cannot be turned by these arms 180 if a higher order wheelis not at zero position. This is fully illustrated in Fig. 18. The frame 187 is rocked by the total lever 191 in the operation of total printing. 
 The printing mechanism employed includes a frame, supporting a strip of paper, and a platen is'mounted on a printer slide and is rocked by the main operating lever to print items, and may be moved back over the total wheels and then rocked to print totals by means of the total printing cam 193. The printer frame 201 is a U-shaped frame pivoted to downwardly extended ears of a strap piece 202 (Fig. 6) which is screwed to the slide 200. The printer frame 201 has an arm 203 (Fig. 8) extending downward in the path of a lever 204.- loosely mounted onthe shaft 17 0. J ournaled in the frame 201 are paper feed rolls-277 and 278, and fast to the lower front edge of the frame is a platen frame in which is mounted a rubber platen. Loosely pivoted on the roll shaft 275 is a presser frame 274 having a roller 276 resting on a tube 273 which is loosely mounted on a shaft riveted in the frame 201. A downwardly projecting piece 295 (Fig. 17) of the platen frame cooperates with upwardly extended piece 123' (Fig. 6) of wheel frame 123 to prevent the platen from contacting with the type on wheels 120 unless said wheels are connected to the wheels 30 by the rocking of the frame 123. 
 There is a ratchet 280 (Figs. 6 and 9) fast to rubber roll 277 which acts with a spring pressed pawl 27 8a pivoted in. a bracket 279 which is fast to slide 200. hen the frame 201 is forced down to print theratchet 280 will pass down over the pawl one tooth and when the frame is raised by its spring 301 (Fig. 8) the pawl will turn the ratchet 280 and rubber roll 277 one tooth space, and through roll 277 contacting with fluted roll 278 will feed the paper forward one space. The pawl 281 (Figs. 6 and 9) mounted on the end of fluted roll shaft 275 is forced in the teeth of ratchet 280 by a spring and holds said rubber roll in fixed position. The detail paper 270 is passed between rolls 276, 273, un- 
' der the rubber platen, and up between rubber feed roll 277 and fluted roll 278, and can be torn off above this roll. The printing frame 201 is held up by spring 301 (Fig. 9), one end of which is fast to stud 302 on the side of frame 201 and the other end to the inner end 303 of a screw stud 304 on the handle of the printing lever 191. 
 To print the items after having been indicated. the main operating lever 253 is pulled forward; and at about the middle of its forward stroke, through a printer operating cam 210 (Fig. 8) fast to the main shaft 70 an operating lever 204 is rocked clockwise and through contact with a lower arm 203 of the frame 201 rocks said frame, thereby forcing the platen 295' against the type on wheels 120 to make the printing impression. 
 In printing from the total printing type wheels 160, the platen and paper are moved rearwardly over the total wheels and the platen actuated to make the printing impression. This total printing operation is effected by movement of the total printing lever 191 loosely mounted on the shaft 170 and guided at its top end in the slot 292 in the top tie piece 16. The lever 191 is normally held in home position by the notch 292 of said slot (see Fig. 11). The lever 191 is rigid with a cam 191 (Fig. 10) which, when the lever is forced back, rocks the frame 187' to allow the arms 180 of the zero eliminating mechanism (Fig. 8) to be rocked ontheir sup port shaft 181 by their springs 12.9 to eliminute the zeros at the left of the last figure of the total. This lever 191 also carries a cam 193 with a locking tooth 193'. \Vhen the lever 191 is forced backward to print a total the cam 193' rocks a lever 196, forcing its hooked end 197 in the path of a projection 197 of a cam 198 fast to main shaft 70, thereby locking said shaft when the lever 191 is out of its normal or home osition. The locking tooth 193 also acts with locking end 195 of lever 1-96 to lock the lever 191 when the lever 196 is rocked by the cam 198 when the main shaft carrying the latter cam is rocked by the operating lever 253. Thus the lever 196 acts to lock the total printing lever 191 when an item is being printed and added and to lock the main shaft 7 0' when a total is being printed. 
 To print the total, the lever 191 is forced slightly to the left, taking it out of the notch 292. It is then forced back as far as it will go, and through its stud 299 contacting with the cam slot 300 in the side of printing frame 201, the frame containing platen, ribbon and paper will be brought back until the platen 295 is directly over the center of the total printing wheels 160. The slide 200 supporting the platen mechanism is stopped in this position and by a further backward movement of lever 191 the stud 299 will force the printer frame 201 downward against the tension of the spring 301 and strike the platen against the type on the wheels 160, thereby printing the total on the paper. 
 After the total has been printed as just described it may be left standing so that further items may be added to it or it may be erased from the total wheels if the accumulation of a new total is to be started. The erasing or clearing is effected by means of the lever 192 previously mentioned. The clearing mechanism is shown in Figs. 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11. The lever 192 is pinned to the shaft 170 and is guided at its top by one of the slots 290 in the top tie plate 16, and held in home position by notch 293, Fig. 11. Also pinned to the shaft 170 is a resetting segment 194 in mesh with a pinion 194 fast to the resetting shaft 162. Fast to lever 192 is a cam 1921 with looking tooth 1922 (Fig. 8). This cam. and tooth cooperate with the lever 196 to lock out the lever 192 when the main shaft 70 is out of home position and to lock the main shaft when the lever 192 is out of home position. Withthis construction the operations of printing and adding an item and resetting the total wheels cannot be done I link 243. 
at the same time. This locking mechanism is practically the same as .is used with the total printing mechanism. 
" ,There is a cam slot 194' (Figs. 2 and m the lower part of the segment 194 engaging a stud 182' on the frame 182. This slot and stud connection 'causes the lining arms 180 to be withdrawn from the teeth of the total wheels 160 so that the wheels can be reset by resetting lever 192." 
 To reset the total wheels 160 the lever 192 is forced slightly to the left, taking 1t out of the notch 293. t is then forced back as far as it will go, and through the above mentioned mechanism will lock the main shaft in home osition, will unlock the total wheels by witlidrawing the arms 180 from the teeth of wheels 160, and will then turn shaft 162 nine-tenths of a revolution, causing the resetting pawls 161 pivoted to the wheels 160 to engage with a spline on the shaft 162 and turn the wheels to their zero positions. 
 To prevent overthrow of the total wheels at this time and also to prevent the wheels from being dratg ed back from zero position by the return 0 t e resetting shaft 162, there is provided a set of arms 295a (Fig. 2 mounted on a stationary shafti296 and eac having a felt roll mounted in its forward end. Normally these rolls are not in contact with the faces of the teeth of wheels 160, being held in elevated position by the lower ends of arms 295 resting against the shaft 181 of the U- shaped frame 182; but the rolls are drop 6. 
J down on the faces of the'wheels 160 w en the frame 182 is rocked backward by the resetting lever 192. These felt rolls put a brake on the wheels 160 on their forward or resetting movement and act as a choke to them by dropping in a tooth space and preventing any backward movement of wheels when the resetting shaft is turned to home osition. Incidentally the felt rolls serve to co clean the type on the wheels 160. 
 he error key mechanism hereinbefore mentioned is illustrated in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 and is controlled by the error key 215 pivoted on the main shaft 70. Its outer upright end is pivoted to the forward end as shown 1n Fig. 2, to enable the key to be latched in depressed position. It has an u per extension 216 with a cam slot 217 engaging a stud 218 fast to the drive link 243. With this construction, when the item set up by the numeral keys 50 is not correct the error key v215 is depressed, which causes the upper arm 216 by its cam slot 217 and stud 218 to lower the drive link 243 so that the stud 244 fast to the drive arm 240 will be in the upper part of the L-sha ed slot 245 of the connecting en the drive lever 240 is then rocked by its 7 cam 242, the item printing wheel frame 123 will not be rocked forward and the item printing wheels 120 will not be connected to the item indicating wheels 30. 
The indicator wheels 30 are returned to zero as previously described, but the item printin wheels 120 and total printing wheels 160 wil not be rotated. 
 The mechanism for repeatedly adding the same amount is illustrated in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8. It is brought into play by means of the repeat key 261 pivoted to the main shaft 70. Its outer upright end is pivoted to the forward end (as shown in Fig. 2) to enable the key to be latched in depressed osition. Its upper arm 275 (,Fig. 8) lies bac of the extension of the detent shaft 127 of the frame 123, and when the key is depressed it will rock said frame 123 forward, thereby causing the pinions 126 to connect the item indicating wheels 30 and item printing wheels 120. The key 261 also has an upward curved portion 270 clearing the bail 71 so that neither the single escapement 76 nor the double escapement 72 will be rocked to release the motors during repeat operations, Pivot'ed to the inner end of the key 261 is a stud 272 projecting under the links 108 and 1081. Depression of the key 261 will raise these links, thereby preventing them from'returning the motors to normal or wound position. 
 After the item is set up on the wheels 30, by operation of numeral keys 50, the repeat key 261 is latched down to connect the wheels 30 to the item printing wheels 120 and disable the return of the motors, the forward stroke of the operating lever 253 causin the indicating w eels 30 to return to zero y the segment 20 and shaft 31. The wheels 30 acting through the intermediate gears 126 will then turn the item type wheels 120 to printing position. The printing from these wheels then takes place, after which the total print- ,ing wheel frame 163 is rocked forward to connect the total printing wheels 160 with the gears 141 and item printing wheels 120. The item printing wheels 120 are then turned to their zero positions by the se ent 131, pinion 132 and shaft 121, and, tirough the transfer gear 141, turn the total printing wheels forward to add the amount. On the backward stroke of the operating lever 253 the segments 20 and 131, and the shafts 31 and 121, are returned to home position. The frame 163 also is rocked by its sprin 130 to disconnect the item wheels 120 from t e total wheels 160. Owing to the fact that the indicators and item type .wheels are connected while the latter are cleared, the amount will be returned to the indicators when the item type wheels .are cleared. This operation is repeated as many times as required, but before the last operation of thelever 253 the repeat-key 261 is unlatched and allowed to return to home position so that the next or last operation, in addition to the adding and listing, will also return the motors 100 and 1011 to their home or normal positions, as the links 108, 108' will have been lowered in are position to return the motor segments against the tension of their springs 105, 105'. As a result the worm shaft 40 will, through its worm portion 40 and nut 46, return or move the indicator wheels 30 to the right or home position, the flexible double escapement 72 allowing for the backward rotation of stop 74 and motor gear train. The return of the repeat key 261 to home position also allowed the item printing wheel frame 123 to be rocked back by its spring 130 as in a regular adding operation, so that when the item type wheels were cleared the indicators were not disturbed. The machine will then be ready to have a different amount entered on the indicators by operation of the keyboard. 
 The novel ink ribbon mechanism previously referred to herein comprises a short piece of two-color ribbon and a formed sheet metal frame for supporting the piece of ribbon. This ribbon mechanism and the mechanism for operating it are shown in Figs. 6, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14. Mounted upon the cross plate 16, previously mentioned, are two guides 16 engaging the edges of the sliding plate 200 which, as before stated, supports the movable platen and paper feeding mechanism. The plate 16 is cut away to provide openings opposite the item printing and total printing type and the plate 200 is provided with a rectangular opening which is about the same length as the ink ribbon frame 290. 
 As before stated, in a general way, when the mechanism is set to print from the item type one of the color bands is under the platen, and when the platen is moved to total printing position, as previously mentioned, the other color band will be set to cooperate with the platen. This change of color is effected by holding the ribbon in either the total printing or the item printing position for a short period of time after the printing platen and its sliding frame 200 have started to move from the one position to the other. For instance, if the ribbon 290 is in the position shown in Fig. 11, which is the item printing position, the black half of the ribbon will be in position to cooperate with the impression platen. Whenv the platen and its supporting plate are moved toward the rearward or total printing position, however, the plate 200 will move about the width of one of the color bands on the ribbon before it will pick up the ribbon and cause it to move with the plate. This relative movement will therefore bring the red color band on the ribbon under the printing platen. 
 An examination of Fig. 8 will show that the ink ribbon 290 is accessible when the parts are in their normal position, so that if it becomes necessary to insert a new ribbon the old one may readily be removed and the new one dropped in place. 
 The metal frame holding the ribbon may be formed from tinned sheet metalor any other material suitable for the purpose, and the entire unit, including the two-color ribbon, can be producedand supplied for a small fraction of the cost of the standard ink ribbon. 
In addition to the low price of the ribbon, 
this construction does away with all ribbonfeedin and reversing mechanisms, as well as complicated mechanisms for shifting the ribbon for multi-color printing. 
 While it is believed that the construction and operation of the machine is clear from the preceding description a general summary of the operation will now be presented in order to bring out more clearly the sequential operation of the mechanisms described. 
 In order to set up an amount to be entered in the machine, which will be exhibited upon the indicators 30, the operating keys 50 are successively depressed. The key of the highest denomination is first operated and thence the remaining ke s in sequence, to the final operation of the ey indicating the lowest denomination. 
 If, for example, the amount 2.50 is to be entered the 2 key 50 is initially operated and upon depression of this key the related stop finger 52 (Fig. 22) will be placed in alignment with the stop finger designated 2 which it will be observed from Fig. 22 requires a differential movement of shaft 90 of two steps commensurate with the value of the key depressed. 
 The shaft 90 is released for operation by withdrawing the nose 78 (Fig. 24) out of the path of one of the stop fingers 92. This is efi'ected by the depression of the bail 71 which is operated by depression of any of the keys. 
 When the shaft 90 is released as just described, the spring 105 (Fig. 2) will be ac tive to turn shaft 90 until the latter is stopped by the coaction of the hook 52 (Fig. 22) with the related stop finger 91. 
 The gear 112 meshing with a driving gear 37 (Fig. 5) will also turn the sleeve 36 (Fig. 4) and the arm 35 secured thereto. It will be remembered that the drive stud 34 (Fig. 4) engages the holes in the indicator wheels 30 so that the rotation of the sleeve 36 will turn all the item indicating wheels 30 that are engaged by the drive stud 34, and in the problem under consideration, all the wheels 30 will be turned to indicate 2. 
 From Fig. 22, it will be noted that when the related key 50 is depressed the hooked n 55 of the bell crank 53 will engage the detent plate 54 temporarily latching the key in depressed position. However, the engagement of the stop finger 91 with the cam portion 56 will disengage the hook 55 from the detent plate 54 thereby releasing the key 50 for its return to normal position. 
When the wheels are set in their differential positions, the series of wheels are given a half-step of movement laterally under 0011- trol of the double escapement 72 (Fig.' .When the bail 71 is depressed by the opera- (Fig. 5 will tion of the key; the 'escapement fin er 72 rocked clockwise t ereby carrying 'itsfront arm from out of contact with the stop arm 74 andbringin its rear.

However, upon the upstroke of the de ressed key 50 "the doub esca ement is roc 'edrearwardlg lzy its spring m the stop arm 74 an moving the. front arm into the path of the stop arm 74. The shaft 40 will, therefore, be turned the balance of one revolution to move the wheels 30'to the left,the 
73 isengaging the rear arm last movement carrying the left hand wheel gaged from the stud 34 t e remaining type. carriers are turned to their normal positions under control of the same motor devices which turns a series of wheels to their difierential positions. The next digit to be entered is 5 in which case the key carrying the key cap 5 will be operated. In the same v manner as previously explained, the series of the indicator wheels with the exception'of the one which was left at the 2 osition will all be turned to indicate 5 so t at upon the return of the depressed key the second indicating wheel 30 will remain at the 5 position and the others will be restored to their normal positions. The last digit to be represented by the keys is 0 in which case the 0 key50 is operated. In such instance, the 
shaft will not be turned as the 0 stop will represent the value 2.50, the amountto be entered in the totalizer. At the first or forward operation of th main operating handle 253 the cam 242 (Fig. 
27) acting on the lever 240 will rock 'frame 123 (Fig. 2) to connect the gears 126 with the indicator wheels30. The item printing Wheels will now be rotated slightly backwardly to bring the printing characters in the printing line. 7 
 During the forward stroke of lever 253 the segment arm 20 (Fig. 2) meshing with gear 22 will turn shaft 31 (Fi 6) so that the groove thereof coactingwi the pawls 38 will When set the platen 295' will be operated to effect an impression from the printing wheels. 
. After wheels 120 are turned to printing posit on, the frame 123 is rocked by a'spring. to I disengage the gears 126 and indicator wheels 30. v 
 At the last half of the forward movement of theoperating lever 253 the cam (Fi 2) acting on the segment 131 will turn shaft 121 (Fig.6) and by means of the spline engaging the variously positioned pawls 124 of the item printing wheels 120 will turn them to zero position and by means of the intermediate gears 141 will turn thetotalizer elements 160 commensurately' The motor 100 is restored to home position during thela'st half of the forward stroke of .-lever 253 by the link 108 (Fig. 5) cooperating with stud 109 secured to motor 100. This restoring movement takes place after the printing im ression from wheels 120 is effected. 
 n t e same manner during the last half of the forward stroke of lever 253 the motor 1011 (Fig. 5) is restored, to home position, throu h the link 1081' (Fi 16) cooperating with t e stud 1091 (Fig. 4% fast to the lower arm of motor 1011. 
 After the wheels 30 are restored to normal the worm shaft 40 will be turned in a direc. tion opposite to the direction it is turned during the operation of the keys to thereby restore the indicator carriage 41 to its home position whereby the wheels 30 are re-e ngaged by the stud 34. 
The amounts entered in the item printing wheels are transferred to the totalizer elements 160 during the resetting of the item printin elements 120. Upon operation of the sha t 70 the cam 166 (Fig. 26) acting upon the extension 164 of the totalizer frame 163 (Fig. 6) will engage the totalizer elements 160 with the item printing wheels 120 through intermediate gears 141. As the item printing wheels 120 are restored to normal the totalizer elements 160 will be actuated a commensurate amount. 
 After the entry in the totalizer the totalizer frame 163 is restored to its normal position, the elements 160 now being held out of engaggment with the transfer gears 141. 
, hen a totalizer element 160 of lower order passes through zero the transfer tooth 169 (Fig 6) thereof contacting the offset portion 146 of the related trip arm 142 will force it backwardly unlatching the transfer arm until it is stopped in its dropping movement by contact with the step ofthe associated arm 142. :The transfer gear 141 will thereby turn and enter an extra unit in the next higher order totalizer element 160. The transfer operation may also be effected when the totalizer element is being actuated during the entry operation in order to effect an extra movement to the higher order totalizer element 160. 
 The tripped'transfer arms 140 are elevated by cam 1716 (Fig. 2) on the main shaft. This operation occurs during the final operation of the machine. 
 'hile the entries are being effected in the totalizer under control of the operating keys precisely in the manner just explained, it is (lsirable to effect the printing of each item as it is entered in the totalizer. This is ac complished by the action of a cam 210 (Fig. 
8) which through contact with an arm 204 rocks arm 203 and the printer frame 201 to force the platen 295' against the item printing wheels 120. 
 When the printer frame 201 is rocked the ratchetwheel 280 (Figs. 6 and 9) will pass down over the pawl 278a a distance of one tooth space so that when the frame 201 is raised, the pawl will turn the ratchet 280 to feed the paper an increment to space the printed items. 
 After a series of items have been entered in the machine, the total is printed on the paper by forcing the total printer lever 191 rcarwardly so that by the action of a stud 299 contacting with the cam slot 300 (Figs. 8 and 9) the printing frame will be shifted rearwardly until the platen is directly over the total printing wheels 160. Further movement of lever 191 will cause the printer frame to be shifted downwardly thereby effecting a. total printing impression on the paper strip by the coaction of the platen 295 with the total printing elements 160. 
 \Vhen lever 191 is forced back, it rocks the frame 187 (Fig. 8) to allow the arms 180 of the zero eliminating mechanism to be rocked on their support shaft by springs 189 to eliminate the zeros at the left of the highest significant figure. 
 If it is desired to restore the totalizer to zero when a total has been derived the resetting segment 194: (Fig. 8) will be operated and by its engagement with the pinion 19 1 secured to the resetting shaft 162 will turn the same and by means of resetting pawls 161 (Fig. 6) will restore the totalizer elements backwardly to zero in a manner well known in the art. 
 When themachine is printing items, the black half of the inking ribbon 290 (Fig. 11) will be employed to effect item imprints upon the record strip in black ink. However, when the total printing frame is shifted rearwa rdly to effect a total imprint the plate 200 will be shifted rearwardly the width of a color band on the ribbon thereby bringing the red color band of the ribbon under the printing platen to identify the total imprints by their printing in a red color. 
 In the event that an amount entry in the indicator wheels 30 is incorrect the error key 215 is operated prior to an operation of the main operating handle; Depression of the error key 215 will cause the link member 243 (Fig. 2) to be shifted downwardly placing the stud 244 of the lever 240 in engagement with a concentric part of the bayonet slot in link 243. This will prevent the item printing wheel frame 123 from being rocked into engagement with the indicators so that when the latter are restored the amount represented thereon will not be entered in either the item printing wheels 120 or the total printing Wheels 160. 
 To effect repeat operations of the amount represented by the indicators, the repeat key 261 is depressed. When such key is latched in its depressed position, it will by the coaction of the arm 275 (Fig. 8) with the stud 127 of frame 123 cause the continuous engagement of the gears 126 with the indicating wheels 30.
