' 40 Claims. (01.177-311) 'I'he present invention relates primarily to a machine adapted, when certain indicia such as numbers are registered therein, to give a signal when any one of the numbers is again entered in the machine. The machine is adapted for the reception therein of various indlcia, but ordinariy each machine is designed with reference to some particular indicia which it is to receive. 
 As illustrative of the invention and in order to make clear the general principles involved, we shall describe hereinafter and ,with reference to the accompanying drawings, a machine particularly designed to be loaded with the'license tag numbers of automotive vehicles, it being assumed that notice of such numbers is desired for some reason, as in the case of stolen cars. In the use of such a machine, the machine has initially registered therein the tag numbers in question. Thereupon, an operator stationed so as to be able to view the tag numbers of vehicles traveling a preferably arterial highway or street enters in the machine the number of each passing vehicle. Should a number be set up corresponding with one of the registered numbers, a signal is given, immediately advising the operator that the number just entered is that of a. sought car so that, as in the case of a stolen car, apprehension may follow. 
 As another example, when. it is desired to identify certain bank notes, their numbers may be loaded in the machine, the operator, as in a bank, then entering in the machine the numbers of the notes'passing through his hands. .For 
this latter use, however, a machine of relatively large range is required in view of the larger numbers to be handled as compared to license tag numbers, As a matter of convenience, therefore, we have chosen to describe a machine only of-sumcient sizeto handle the ordinary license a numbers. 
 In the State of California at the present time, license tag numbers run to no more than six spaces of which five may be numerals and one a letter. By way of example, .we have chosen to describe a, machine of a capacity designated forsuch typical indicia, that is, made. up of no more than five numerals and a letter. A machine of this capacity must be able to register distinctively a number of less than the maximum number of places as well as full numbers and numbers wherein the same numeral may be repeated any number of times up to five. For this purpose, 
five separate banks of numeral keys may be provided, but preferably, and as hereinafter described, a single bank or series of keys, 0 to 9, 
' results. I Since the invention can be best underis provided, each individual key being capable or five selections. This latter feature is mentioned particularly since it is of general application and not limited to use in the main machine with which the present invention is concerned. 0 Briefly, the main machine comprises number and letter keys actuatable to swing shield plates from a limit position in which the plates are normally at rest to a limit operated position. For the D Pose of registering a number in the machine, the proper keys are depressed, thus mov-' ing the associated plates from normal to operated position. The plates which are initially imperforate are provided with aligned apertures while in this limit position and thereupon are returned to normal position bysuitable clearing means. When the same keys are again depressed, again swinging the same plates to their limit positions, the apertures are again in alignment and a source of light at one side of the series of plates is adapt- 20 ed to activate, through the aligned openings, a photo-electric cell-at the other side of the series of plates, the cell being arranged to cause a signal to be. given. The machine to be described is designed to have several hundred numbers thus 25 registered therein and when any one of them is again set up, a signal will be given, whereas when any number is set up which has not been previously registered in the machine, no signal is possible. The movable plates constitute carrying 30 means for a multiplicity of given individual data (herein numbers), each datum having a plurality of components in certain order and the various data having diilerent'com'ponents or components in common but in difierent-arrangement or association; A key is provided for each possible component and when the keys are operated to repeat a datum which has been previously set up on the carrying means, a signal stood from a specific description of the apparatus, 1 we shall proceed to describe it with reference to the embodiment shown in the drawings, this embodiment, it is again emphasized, being shown merely by way of example.

. Referring to the drawings, and particularly to Figures 1 and 2, the machine comprises a casing generally designated by the reference numeral 2@,'this casing being made up of a rectangular bottom plate ii, a front plate 22, a rear plate 23, side plates '26 and 25, and top plates 25 and 27. For the support of the machine, cushion feet as at Ella. may be secured to the lower side of plate 2i. The outlines of the side plates may beclearly' seen in Figure 2, from which figure itwill be noted that the forward portion of these plates is rearwardly and upwardly inclined to 'rear, upwardly projecting substantially semi-circular portions. The top plate 27 is flush with the upper edges of the inclinedportions of the side plates and at itsupper end is supported on a bar 28 which extends between the side plates and is secured thereto. The top plate 26 conforms to the semi-circular edges of the rear portion of the side plates and is supported therebetween, its 
rward edge projecting into a groove 28' in bar 29 immediately behind the upper edge of plate 2'3. A shaft 29 extends between the side plates for support thereby in substantially concentric relation to the curve of the semi-circular side plate portions. To the rear of shaft 29, bars 30 and ti extend between the side plates with their upper faces in the same plane, the side plates forwardly of shaft 29 being similarly connected by a bar 32. 
 Referring also to Figures 3, 6 and 7, a frame, or block, generally designated by the reference numeral 33, consists of a series of segment shaped plates 34 pierced adjacent the spices and strung on shaft 29. The plates 34 are suitably interconnected in uniformly spaced relation by spacer strips or plates as at 34 and the frame thereby constituted extends substantially from side to side of the machine, rests on bars 30 and 3|,and is fixedly secured in this position. Each plate 34 is provided with a multiplicity of perforations 35, those of each plate being in register with those of the other plates and also with. perforations 24' and 25' formed in the side plates 24 and 25, Figure '1. 
 A. series of segment-shaped shield plates 36, Figures 1, 2,- 3, 6 and 7, is strung on shaft 29' in alternating relation to the plates 34 so as tobe able to swing from a normal orrest position in which their outer ends are supported by bar-' 2 to an operated limit position in which they are disposed between the plates 34 and rest on strips 34 in blocking relation to all of the apertures 35 in the latter. The plates 35 have a somewhat smaller radial dimension than plates 34 and thus clear the tie rod 31 which connects the side plates Hand 25 adjacent the tops of the latter. As shown in the figures just mentioned, plates 36 are constituted by metal plates provided with perforations adapted to register with perforations 35 of the fixed plates 34, the perforations of the shield plates being initially filled with some readily melted material. As 
clearly shown in Figure 3, each plate 38 is provided with an aperture 39 of a size to receive freely shaft 29 and at its apex with a rounded heel portion to and an opposite straight portion Mi. 
 A modified form of a shield plate 36' is shown in Figures 14 and 15, each of these plates cornprising a metal frame 38 of substantially segmental form and provided with an aperture 39' of a size to receive freely shaft 29. Between its diverging arms frame 38 supports a sheet ii of cardboard or the like, the cardboard being engaged in the frame in the manner shown in Figure 15m The outer edge of the cardboard issimilarly engaged in an arcuate frame portion 38. 
1 Ordinarily all of the plates 36 rest'on bar 32. 
 By means of keys and certain related mechanism, 
selected ones of the plates may bethrown to a position in which they lie within frame 33. The position of plates 35 may be viewed by the operator through a transparent panel 23' in the forward side of cover plate 26. 
 For the purpose ofselecting the proper plates 36, there is provided a keyboard comprising a transverse series of number keys J2 and three rows of letter keys so, the number keys bearing the numbers to 9. A full quota of letter keys is provided, except, as here shown, the letter keysI, 0, and Q, .which are replaced by keys bearing the numerals 1, 2 and 3, these keys being hereinafter referred to as blocking keys. It will be understood that the blocking keys may have any other desired arrangement on the keyboard, but preferably the normal typewriter key arrangement is retained with as little change as possible. The number keys 42 are arranged on the upper ends of stems as at 44, Figure 2, which project downwardly through suitable comb plates ar-, 
ranged in an opening 21' in plate 2? and form parts of key levers 45. The letter keys 43 are similarly arranged on stems 46 forming parts of levers 41. Levers 4 1 are pivoted in suitably spaced relation on a rod 48 supported beneath bar 28 and have their inner extremities flattened to lie in a horizontal plane and bifurcatediigures 2, .3 and 6. As may be seen from Figure 6, 
rod. 48 is secured to the side plates and has strung thereon spacer blocks 49 for the levers 47. Each lever 41 is fixed in a kerf in an associated block 49 and thus has ample bearing surface on rod 48. 
Bar 28 is provided with a vertical bore immediately above each lever 41, the lower end of each inner extremity of the lever then being directed upwardly and rearwardly and provided with'a barrel portion 52 secured thereto and pivotally engaging a rod 53 extending between the casing side walls. The barrels are held against axial bore receiving a compression spring 50 which, 7 
displacement on rod 53 by means of stop collars as at 54, Figure 6. 4 Fixed toeach barrel and constituting a part of each lever 45 is a downwardly extending finger 55 and each lever 45 forwardly of shaft 53 is connected with bar 32 by means of a tension spring 45'. The arrangement of fingers 55 on the barrels is such that they are uniformly spaced along rod 53. 
 Each of levers l5 and 41 .is guided in a comb plate 58 mounted on a cmss bar 51, the latter having also mounted thereon a yoke 58 having a horizontal portion extending above all of the levers and covered with yieldingmaterial 88 to limit upward movement of the levers. A pair of arms 88 and GI, Figures 2 and 8, rigidly secured beneath bar 51 and projecting toward front plate 22 support three yokes 62, 83 and 84 which have padded cross portions 85, 88 and 81 providing downward stops for the three rows of letter key levers, a similar yoke 88 being mounted on bar 51 for cooperation with the number key levers. 
 From the above, it will be understood that all of the key levers are normally held in the position shown in Figure 2. Upon depression of a number key, the finger portion 55 there is given movement toward the rear of the machine, while on depression of a letter ke its inner extremity is swung upwardly. 
 Directly beneath the inner ends of levers 81, a bar 68 is fixed between the side walls of the casing, Figures 2 and 3, this bar being provided with a vertical bore 18 beneath each lever and each intersecting a counterbore 1|. An angle strip 12 secured to bar 68 has a horizontal top flange 12' above bar 88 and is provided with bores in alignment with bores 18. A stop member in the form of a pin 13 is vertically slidable in each of bores 18 and has its upper end extending through and provided with a head I3 somewhat above the flange 12' with the lower end of the pin normally blocking counterbore II. A compression spring interposed between said flange 12' and an abutmen. 15 on pin 13 normally holds the latter in the position shown in-Figure 3. The inner bifurcated ends of levers 41 normally lie against the top flange of member 12, each engaging a pin 13 below the head 13 thereof. 
 Slidable in each counterbore II is one end of a rod 16 whose other upwardly oil'set end is slidably supported on a bar 11 extending across the rear portion of the casing. Fixed on the rear end of each rod 16 is an upstanding substantially rectangular plate 18 which, in the-rest position of the bars, has a front edge in substantial engagement with the curved heel portion 48 of a shield plate 38. In this position of parts, the forward end of rod 16 abuts pin 13, as shown in Figure 3. An anchor plate 18 is secured against the lower face of bar'68 and has secured thereto the ends of tension springs 88, which at their other ends are secured to rods 18 through downwardly projecting ears 8I. 
 A cross bar 82 is spaced somewhat rearwardly of the lower end of fingers 55 and secured between the casing side walls. Bar 82 is provided, as here shown, with fifty vertical bores 83 which are in alignment with bores formed in the horizontal upwardly spaced flange 84 of an angle strip secured to bar 82. A counterbore 88 intersectsthe lower end of each bore 88 and slidable in each bore 83 with its upper end guided in the flange 84 is a pin 81. Passed through each pin '81 in parallel relation to the casing side walls is a pin 88 which has a substantial projection forwardly and rearwardiy of thepin 81. A compression spring 88 is interposed between pin 88 and flange 84 so that each pin 81 is normally yield ingly held in the position shown in Figure 3. The rearwardly projecting portion of each pin 88 is engaged between a pair of posts 88, Figures 2, 3 and 6, these posts having their lower ends fixed in vertical bores in bar 82 and serving to hold pins 88 against any appreciable movement about .the 
has a beveled portion immediately overlying the upper edges of the plates. Rods 8| are continued a substantial distance beyond the associated plates 82 and have downwardly turned extremities to which are connected tension springs 83 which at their other ends are connected to an anchor plate 84 on bar 11. 
From the above, it will be understood that in the rest position of the parts, rods 16 and 8| are blocked in the positions shown in Figure 3 by means of pins 13 and81, the plates 18 and 82 associated with rods 18 and 8|, respectively, being in substantial engagement with the curved heel portions 48 of plates 38 which are in their normal position wherein their upper ends are supported on bar 32. Preferably, bar 32 has a facing pad 32' on which the edges of plates 38 rest. It will be seen from Figure 6 that the rear portions of rods 16 are also somewhat laterally oifset for the sake of proper clearance. 
 Bar 82 has fixed to its forward face an elongatedblock 85 provided on its forward face with a horizontal groove 86. Horizontal members as at 81 projecting forwardly of bar 82 support an elongated block 88 in parallel relation to block 85 and provided with a' horizontal groove 88, 
"groove 88 being parallel to groove 88 and lying in the same horizontal plane. An elongated slide or carriage I88 is provided with grooves MI and I82 on its opposite edges in registering relation with grooves 88 and 88, the opposed pairs of grooves. receiving balls I83 and I84 adapting the slide for guided longitudinal movement relative to members 88 and 86 with a minimum of friction. 
 A shaft I85, Figures 3 and 4 in particular, is supportedat its ends by means of uprights I88 and I81 at the ends of slide I88, the shaft being held against longitudinal displacement by means of stop collars I88 and I88 on the opposite sides of upright I88. Strung on shaft I85 are ten seletor members or intermediate levers I I8, one associated with each of the number key levers. Each of these levers includes a barrel portion III oscillatable on rod I85 and a longitudinally expanded downwardly projecting arm portion 4 l2, and has at its extreme right hand end, Figure 6, a finger H3 which projects rearwardly from an elongated web I I4. The fingers I I8 are uniformly spaced along shaft I85. A horizontal rod H5 extends in parallel relation to shaft I85 and slightly below the latter, rod H5 having forwardly turned ends secured to the carriage uprights I88 and I81. The arm portion II2 of each intermediate lever I I8 has secured to its rear side a leaf spring H6 which engages the underside of rod H5 and thus normally yieldlngly holds the finger H3 in engagement with the top of the rod. In the rest position of the machine, the lever H0 at the extreme left, Figure 6, has its finger II3 positioned beneath pin 88 of the first stop pin or member 81. As will be hereinafter explained, the carriage I00 is adapted to be stepped to the right so that each finger H8 comes successively under the next four pins 88 for possible cooperation therewith. The left hand extreme portion of the carriage is determined by a buffer pad Ill adjustably mounted on a bracket H8 in position to be engaged by the endof shaft I05. As most clearly seen in v I45 and surrounds pin I44. 
Figures 3 and 4, the number lever fingers 55 I have their lower ends positioned immediately adjacent the lower ends of arms N2 of the intermediate levers I I0 and each finger 55, due to the longitudinal extent of its associated arm II2, is always in position to engage the latter throughout the range of travel of the carriage I00. The carriage is normally yieldably urged toward the right by means of a tension spring H8 connected at one end to post I06 and at its other end to an arm II9, Figures 3 and 4, projecting from bar 32. Carriage I00 at its intermediate portion is pro- 'vided with a series of forwardly faced rack teeth I20, Figures 3 and 4, engaged by'a gear .I2I which is fixed on a vertical shaft I22 journaled at its upper end in block 98, clearance for the forward portion of gear I2I 'being provided by a slot, I23 in angle strip I2. 
 The lower end of shaft I22 is angularly grooved to receive rollers I20 and I25 journaled in upright flanges I26 and I21 on a ratchet wheel I28, Fig-' ures 3 and 11. The ratchet wheel rests on the horizontal vflange I29 of a bracket I30 which is fixed to a block I3I on the floor plate 2i. Ratchet I28 is spaced somewhat above fia'nge I29 by means of a collar I32. The ratchet is connected by means of a sleeve journaled in flange I29 with a disc I33 spaced below the'latter, the lower extremity'of shaft I22 being received in the sleeve. A brake arm I34, Figure 10, pivoted beneath flange I28 is held against disc I93 by means of a leaf spring I35mounted on the arm and bearing against an adjustable stop I35 on the bracket Bracket I30, Figures 3, 5 and 11, has a pair of forwardly and upwardly projecting arms I36 and I37 in which are threaded and locked by means of associated nuts, a pair of pivot'pins I38 and I39, whose opposed pointed ends engage bearing recesses formed in the upright arm portions of a v yoke I40, said'arm portions at their upper ends supporting a cross member 'I4I to which is'bolted a forwardly projecting arm I42. The forward end of arm I42 projects betwten the legsof a yoke I43 which has'a padded cross portion serving to limit upward movement of arm I42. A pi n I44 is pivoted to the extremity of arm I42 on an axis parallel to the pivoting axis of yoke I40, the 
' pin extendingupwardly and having its end re- -ceived in an aperture in the extremity of an arm I45 which projects forwardly from a rock shaft I46 pivotally mounted on needle point bearings comprising-pins I41 and I48 supported in brackets I49 and I50 on the forward face of bar 69, Figures 3 and 5. An angle strip I5I is supported on arms I52 and I53 projecting forwardly from rock shaft I46, arm I45being passed through an opening in bar I 5I, which latter extends directly beneath the downwardly bowed portions of all of levers 45. A compression spring I54 is interposed between the extremities of arms I42 and The action of the spring is limited by means of an abutment I55 on pin I48 above arm I45. 
 Yoke I40 has a rearwardly extending arm.I56 on which is pivoted a pawl I57 by means of a screw I58. At its ofiset extremity, Figure ,11, arm I55 has pivoted thereto, and therebeneath, a pawl I59, both of these'pawls being adapted to cooperate with ratchet I28. Yoke I40 has a forwardly extending arm portion I6I in the extremity of which is formed a slot I62 substantially concentric with pin I58. A finger I63 is pivoted on a screw I64 which passes through slot. 
its of this oscillation may be determined through selective positioning of pivot screw I64 in slot I62. Pawl I59 has fixed thereon an upwardly extending pin I66 which is adapted to abut a portion IS? on arm I56 to limit the movement of its nose portion toward the ratchet and pin I is connected with the tail portion of pawl I5l by means of a tension spring I68. 
 Pawl I5l is normally engaged with a tooth of ratchet I28, the ratchet tending to rotate in a clockwise direction, Figure 11, due to the action of spring I I8, whose efiect is transmitted through the rack teeth I20 on the slide, gear I2I, and shaft I22. Due to this rotative tendency of the ratchet, pawl I5? is held in its limit position of counter-clockwise rotation as determined by the finger I63 and in this position, its operative face is substantially in the same vertical plane as the operative extremity, f the nose portion of pawl I59. If arm I42 is eprgessed, thus rocking yoke movement of slide I00 is permitted. As pawl I5'I is moved upwardly, as just described, to release a tooth, spring I68 acts to swing the pawl in a clockwise direction so that its nose comes to a position above and behind the tooth which it has just engaged and above and in front of the sucyoke I40. 
ceeding tooth. If arm I42 is now permitted to. swing upwardly, the arm I56 of yoke I40 swings downwardly, the-nose of pawl I59 is moved below the tooth with which it has just been in engagement to free the same and at the same time the nose of pawl I51 is moved in front of the succeeding tooth. Hereupon, ratchet wheel I28 is rotated in clockwise direction through the action of spring IIB until it is brought to a stop by pawl I51 as the latter reaches its limit of movement in counter-clockwise direction, the pawls now being in their original rest position in which they are yieldingly held by means of a torsion spring I69 surrounding the outer end portion of pivot pin I39 and anchored at one end to the latter and at the other to the adjacent arm of The rear sides of the ratchetteeth are preferably beveled, as shownin Figure 3,- to facilitate the commutating action of the pawls. The described rotational step of ratchet wheel I28 has permitted slide I00 to advance one step to the right, Figures 4 and 6. It being understood that fingers II 3 of intermediate levers III are each associated with five of the stop pinsl'l, 
the step to the right permitted by the mechanism just described will bring each finger under the succeeding pin 88 of its associated group. Succeeding steps will bring the fingers under the succeeding pins 88 up to the final and fifth pin. 
 At its right hand limit of movement, Figure 4, the slide upright I81 abuts a spring contact finger I18, see also Figure 16, moving it against a fixed contact finger Ill and closing a circuit, to be more particularly described hereinafter, up to a relay I12, Figures 6, l2 and 13. The relay includes a coil I18 and a core I14 in front of which is disposed an armature I15 which is fioatingly supported by means of slots in its sides engaging spaced projections at the ends of a, leg I16 of a bracket I18, the lower extremity of the armature resting against a wall I11 of a yoke I11 secured to leg I18 and being yieldingly held against said wall by means ,of a compression spring I18. 
 The spring I18, influencing the armature below its pivoting axis, normally holds the upper portion of the armature away from core I14, as particularly shown in Figure 12. Armature I15 has .an insulating backing I18 aflixed thereto and through which projects a stud I88, likewise secured to the armature, the stud being surrounded by an insulating sheath I8I. An arm I82 has an apertured hub portion I88 of insulating material received on the end of stud I88 and'clamped against sheathing I8I by means of a nut I84. In order to prevent arm I82 from turning about stud I88, its lower extremity is engaged by a pin I 85 which is fixed at one end in the insulating backing I18. A contact plate I86 is apertured to receive the insulating sheath I 8I and is slidable thereon. The lower end of the plate is also apertured and provided with an insulating bush ing I81 which is slidable on pin I85, the lower extremity of the plate being formed as a finger bent in the direction of theinsulating block I18 and received in an aperture I88 therein, all of these provisions serving to maintain plate I86 in the upright position shown. A compression spring I89 surrounding sheath I8I abutshub I83 with one end and plate I88 with the other and holds the latter normally against insulating backing I18. 
 At its upper end, plate I88 is bifurcated to present a pair of contact fingers I88 and I8I. Arranged on an insulating block I82 on an upper leg of bracket I18 are a pair of fixed contacts I88 and I84 in connection withterminal screws I85 and I88 and separated by a shield plate I81 of insulating material. The upper end of arm I82 is provided with an aperture in which is slidably engaged one end of a pull rod I88 which has a head I88 on the inner side of arm I82. The other end of pull rod I88 extends through an aperature in the casing side wall 28 and is connected to one arm of a bell crank lever 288, the same arm of this lever being connected by means of tension spring 28I with a lug 282 on a vertical. 
wall 288 of an extension framesecured to the outer side of wall 28 of the main casing so that head I88 is held against arm I82 and the movement of the pull rod under the influence of spring 28I thereby limited. The bell crank lever 288, Figures 7 and 9, comprises a vertical shaft portion pivoted between screws 284'and 288 secured in brackets 288 and 281 fixed to wall 28 of the machine casing. The other arm 288 ofthe bell crank lever 288 normally projects slightly within wall 288 through .an opening therefor provided and has pivotally mounted thereon on a vertical I of lever 244 has its terminal portion bent subaxis a pawl 288 which is pulled in a counterclockwise direction by means of atension spring 2I8 connected between a. tail portion of the pawl and a lug 2 on arm 288. Rotation of pawl 288 under the influence of spring 2I8 is limited by 5 abutment of the tail portion of the pawl with a pin 2I2 on arm 288. 
 Referring particularlyto Figures 1 and 7, a cylindrical collar 2I3 fixed to casing side wall 24 in surrounding relation to'perforations 24 has 10 hinged thereto a reflector housing 2 I4 which carries a parabolic reflector 2I5, a bulb 2I8 and a transparent closure plate 2". The reflector housing 2 is adapted to be held in operative position by means of a thumb nut 2I8 in well 15 known manner. Collar 2I3 has a translucent insert 2I9 by means of which the operation of the bulb may be observed. 
 A cylindrical collar 228 is secured to casing side wall 25 in surrounding relation to perforations 20 25' and supports a plano-convex lens 22I. A free space exists between lens HI and an end wall 222 of the extension frame. Quick acting shutter mechanism 223 is secured to the outer side of wall 222, which latter is provided with an aper- 25 ture registering with the shutter opening. The shutter mechanism, which may be of any suitable construction, includes a shutter 224 and an actuating plunger 225 which carries a roller 228 at "its extremity, the plunger being guided between 30 a pair of rollers 221 and 228 J'curnaled between a pair of strips228 and 288 fixed to the wall 222, Figures 7 and 9. A shelf 23I fixed on the outer side of wall 222 supports a socket 232 in which is engaged a photo-electric tube 283 in register 35 with the shutter opening. 
 A spindle 284 mounted in wall 222 and the parallel wall 235 of a bracket secured to the outer face of wall 222 has rotatably mounted thereon a wheel 286 providewwith peripheral cams 281 which cooperate with roller 226 of the shutter actuating plunger 225. Wheel 2218 is intended to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction and each cam surface has a relatively gradual arcuate shaped cam rise terminating in an abrupt drop. A pin 238 is fixed in each cam element, these pins being uniformly spaced and projecting toward wall 222. 
 Also journaled on spindle 284 is a disc 288 to which are secured, near the periphery of the disc, a series of pins 248 projecting toward wall 288. Wheel 288 and disc 288 are connected by means of a torsion spring 2 surrounding spindle 284, the spacing of the discs on the spindle being maintained bysuitable collars, of which the end ones are shown at 242 and 248. v 
 A bell crank lever 244 is pivotally supported on a vertical axis on a plate 248 secured in the corner between walls 288 and 222. One arm 2.48 
stantially at right angles and projecting through an opening in wall 222 and into the path of pins 288, one of the pins normally abutting the extremity of arm 248 to hold wheel 288 against rotation. The other arm of lever 244 has its extremity bent at substantially right angles and extending through the opening in wall 288 provided for lever arm 288 and provided with a recess 241 having at its outer end a cam surface adapted to be engaged by the nose of pawl 288. Lever 70 244 is yieldingly held in the position shown in Figure '7 by means of a tension spring 248 extending between an arm of the lever and a fixed arm 248 on wall 222, the action of the spring being limitedby a stop 258 on wall 222 in post- 18 shaft 252 has secured thereto an upright arm 253, to the other end. of which is pivotally connected a latch 250 on an axis parallel to shaft Latch 254 is in the plane of pins 260 and 252. is provided on its underside with a notch 255 adapted to engage one of said pins. Finger 250 is yieldingly pulled downwardly by means of a tension spring 256 which is connected between it and the arm 253. Fixed to shaft 252 in the plane of teeth 238, but to one side of the extremity of lever arm 296, Figure '1, is an upwardly extending arm 251 whose upper end normally projects slightly within the rotational path of pins 238 at a point slightly above the end of lever arm 256. A tension spring 253 is connected between arm 253 and a bracket 222' on wall 222 and takes up any play in the linkage to assure that latch 256 will normally be held in its extreme right hand position, Figure 9, so that a pin 240 will always be properly engaged in notch 255. This spring also assures the proper limit positoning of arm 251 whose upper end normally projects only to a slight extent into the path of pins 238. A dog 240a, pivoted on bracket222', normally engages a pin 290 to hold disc 239 against retrograde movement under the action of torsion spring 24!. The dog is yieldingly urged toward the pins by a tension spring 240b, its 
range of movement being limited by a pin 2400 fixed on bracket 222 and extending into a recess 240d in the dog. The inner end of shaft 252 has fixed thereon an upstanding arm 258 to the upper end of which is pivotally connected oneend of a link 259 which extends outwardly througn wall 203 and along casing wall 25 to the upper end of an arm 260 fixed on the outwardly projecting end of a rock shaft 26! which, within the machine, is journaled in the fixed arms 60 and 6|. 
 Fixed to shaft 26l at the ends of the keyboard are a pair of forwardly extending arms in the form of socket elements 262 and 263 adapted to receive the shank portions 264 and 265 of a hand bar 266 at the front end of the machine, the said shank portions being passed through slots as at 261, Figure 2, in the front casing wall 22. Beneath a lug on arm 263 is disposed a compression spring 268 which, at its lower end, bears against the seat 269 on bottom plate 2|, any suitable stop means being provided to limit'the effect of the spring. A rearwardly extending arm 210 rigidly fixed on shaft 26l, has at its rear extremity a slot 21l in which is engaged a, pin 212 on'an arm 213 which is fixed to a rock shaft 214 extending between the casing. side walls. .Adacent its ends, shaft 214 has fixed thereon upvardly and rearwardly extending arms 215 and 216, Figures 2, 4, 6 and '1, which have slotted extremities engaging a bar 211 which normally occupies a position immediately in front of the straight heel portions 40'- of plates 36 when the latter are in the dotted line actuated position shown in Figure 3. Bar 211 has its ends secured in arms 218, Figures 2, 3 and 7, which at their other ends have apertures freely receiving shaft spectively, and the pair of switches thus connected thereto and to a post 28! projecting downwardly from bar 11, Figure 3. A vertical rock shaft 282 pivotally engaged at its ends by'polnts 283 and 286 in a bracket 285 has secured thereto a sickle shaped arm 286 which is engageable '5 by arm 219 upon rocking shaft 214 in a clockwise direction, Figure 3, to, rock-shaft 282 in clockwise direction, Figure 6. At its top, shaft 282 has fixed thereto a forwardly'p'rojecting arm 281 which has a bifurcated end in which the 10 slide upright I06 is freely engaged, Figure 6. 
 Arm 210 has fixed thereon a cam block 288, Figures 2 and 4. A block 289, fixed to bottom plate 2!, between arm 210 and yoke I43 pivotally supports an upwardly extending finger 290, the 15 pivoting axis of the finger being parallel to the vertical plane of arm 210. Finger 299 is urged toward cam block 288 by means of a compres-' sion spring 29L the action of the spring being limited by a'stop in the form of alock screw 20 292. At its upper end, finger 290 pivotally supports a lever 293 on an axis parallel to its own pivoting axis. At its right hand end, Figure 5, lever 293 rotatably supports a roller 294 which is engageable by cam block 288 when arm 210 25- is elevated upon depression of the hand bar 266. Lever 293 has a tail portion extending above an 'arm I42 fixed to and extending below the outer -erably somewhat bevelled as shown in Figure 5. 
When the cam block strikes the roller, lever 293 and finger 290 are moved somewhat to' the left,35 
Figure 5, and the tail of the'lever is depressed, engaging arm I42 and rocking yoke- I40 in a counter-clockwise direction, Figure 3, so that pawl H9 is moved into operative position. relative to ratchet I28. 1 
 The blocking keys I, 2 and 3, hereinabove referred to, have downwardly extending stem portions 295, 298 and 291 respectively, Figure 8. An insulating slab 298 is supported between arms 60 and 6|, Figure 8, and supports a fixed contact finger 299 beneath stem 295 and a fixed fin- .ger 300 beneath stems 296 and 291. An insulating block 30l on top of slab 298 has fixed thereto spring contact fingers 302 and 303 overlying the fixed contact fingers 299 and 300, re- 
stituted are normally open, as shown in Figure 8. F 
 On an insulating block 304 is mounted a spring contactfinger 305 which has secured to its free end a projecting insulating plate 306 disposed beneath a clip 301 mounted on block 304 imme-' diately beneath a lug 308 on am 262, a compression spring 309 being interposed between lug 308 and the insulating plate 306 and passing through an aperture 3l0 in strip 301. Mounted on an insulating strip 3| l .which overlies the rear portion of contact strip 306 is a. fixed contact finger 3| 2 backed bya rigid 1118119 lating plate 3l3. With lever arm 262 in the normal position shown, the switch constituted by strips 305 and 3l2 is closed. 9 Since in the particular use ofthe machine de'- scribed, house current is ordinarily not avail able, all of the electrical devices are preferably adapted to be operated from an ordinary 6,vol t automobile battery. While in Figure 16we have included such a battery in the diagram, the battery being designated by the reference numeral 3, it will be understood that ordinarily a socket 75 switch no, m, the fixed portion In of the lat ter being in connection through a conductor 3I8 with a conductor 3 I 9 which is in connection with one end of coil I13, the other end of the coil being grounded. Switches 299 and 300 are arranged across conductors 3I1 and 3I8. 
 A conductor 320 leads from relay contact I94 to one end of the filament of bulb 2I6, the other end of the filament being grounded. Conductor 3I9 leads to the spring contact finger 305, the fixed contactfinger 3I2 being in connection with conductor 320 through a conductor 32I. 
 -The terminal A+ of the B eliminator is grounded. Terminals -B+ and B- are led'to a 30,000 ohm resistor 322 through conductors 323 and 324 whence C leads 325 and 326 extend to a potentiometer 321 which may be conveniently disposed in the casing plate 21, Figure 1. Whenlight strikes the photo-electric cell 233 current flows from the terminal B+ of the B eliminatorthrough conductor 324, a conductor 328, the coil 329 of a relay 330, a conductor 328' and a milliammeter 33I, arranged in casing plate 21, Figure l, to the plate of an amplifying tube 332 and the anode 333 of the photo-electric cell 233. From this point the flow is through the cell, which includes the cathode334', a conductor 335, the 
grid of tube 332, a grid resistance 336 to the point 331 of the potentiometer 321. A filament circuit extends from terminal A of the B eliminator through a conductor 338, a rheostat 339, and a conductor 338 to the filament and thence" to a ground. Finally, a buzzer or other signalling dev'ce 340 is in connection with terminal A- of the eliminator through a conductor 340, and 
through a conductor 342 and relay 330 to a ground. 
The B" eliminator is of a flat type adapted to rest on the bottom plate of the machine casing beneath the frame 33 and the disposition of the amplifying tube 332 is shown in Figure '7, the re- -lay 330 being shown in Figure 9 as is also the 30,000 ohm resistor 322. The rheostat 339 is also shown in Figure 9 and the resistance 336 may be conveniently made up of a number of units arranged in series in a glass tube mounted in the casing at the rear of the machine. All the elements outside of easing wall 25 are enclosed in a casing extension 20'. 
 It, for example, the number 8M8496 is to be registered in the machine, the number key 8 is depressed, it being understood that carriage I00, 
is in its extreme left hand position as shown in Figure 6. Upon depression of the number key its associated lever is swung about shaft 53 andits depending extremity 55 strikes the expanded arm II2 of its associated selector member or intermediate lever IIII causing the lever IIO to.rock in counter-clockwise direction so that finger II 3 of the lever rises under pin 33 and thus lifts stop pin 81. As the stop pin rises the inner end of its associated rod 9I is released and the rod is instantaneously moved toward the front of the machine through its associated spring 33. The plate 92 on rod 9| being engaged behind'the 'pass through to the lens 22I. 
heel portion 40 of the plate 36 moves the same from its full line position, Figure 3, to the dotted lineposition wherein it lies-in frame 33 between a pair of perforated plates 34. Depression of the key has also caused depression of bar I5I, Fig- 5 ure 3, and arm I45,-and the latter acting through spring I54 and arm I42 rocks'the yoke I40 in a counter-clockwise direction about its axis so that pawl I51 moves upwardly to free the engaged tooth of ratchet I20 and pawl I59 comes in front 10 of the same tooth without permitting any rotation of the ratchet. However, as soon as the number 0 key is released, permitting arm I45 to as-' sume its normal position, yoke I40 is likewise returned to its normal position and ratchet I28 is permitted to rotate one tooth in the manner previously explained so that finger II3 now rests beneath the second pin 88 of its associated group to permit the associated rod 16 to move forward under the influence of spring 80 so that another shield plate is moved into frame 33 in the manner above mentioned. This operation does not affect the position of the slide I00. 
 The number 8 key is again depressed and lifts the second of its associated group of stop pins 81, causing another shield plate to be moved into the frame. When the key is released the carriage again advances one step. 
 The 4, 9 and 6 keys are now pressed in succession, in each instance causing another shield plate to be'moved into the frame and in each instance causing a one step advance of the carriage upon releaseof the depressed key. There are now six shield plates 36 in frame 33. The reflector housing 2I4 being swung out, a heated rod or wire is inserted in a perforation 24' and run through the aligned perforations in plates 36, 40 thus forming aligned perforations in the six shield plates 36 which are in frame 33. Thus a through opening is provided from side to side of the machine so that light from bulb 2I6 may Since there may be several hundred perforations 24, 25 and 35, several hundred different numbers may be similarly registered or loaded in the machine. Desirably a puncturable and renewable sheet 345 is secured to the inner-side of plate 24 in covermg relation to perforations 24 as a means of indicating, through the perforations appearing therein, those of perforations 24 which have already been used. 
 Assuming that in the subsequent operation of the machine the number "8M8496 is entered by the operator, as the number 6 keyis released and the slide is stepped to the right, it abuts the spring contact finger I10, moving it against the fixed finger HI and closing a circuit up to 00 coil I13 of relay I12 so that the latter is energized and attracts armature I 15. The movement of the armature causes plate I86 to bridge contacts I93 and I94 so that a circuit is now completed to bulb 2I6 and at the same time a holding circuit for the armatureis completed by means of conductors 3I9 and MI through switch 305 3I2. Movement of the armature I15 has also drawn pull rod I98 to the right, thus rocking bell crank lever 200 which in turn, through pawl 209, rocks bell crank lever '244 in a counter-clockwise direction, withdrawing the extremity of arm 246 from beneath the pin 233 resting thereon. Hereupon cam wheel 236 is rotated in a counter clockwise direction, Figure 9, under the influence (I of spring 2M, and while bell crank lever 244 immediately returns to its original position, in the path of the next pin 238, the latter strikes the top surface of arm 25! so that rotation of the cam wheel is arrested with roller 226 substantially at the peak of the cam rise, shutter 224 being thus opened. Since the number just entered is one of those originally set up in the machine, a light ray will traverse the frame and the aligned apertures of the shield plates 35 therein. Whatever the positionof this ray with respect to lens 22! it will be refracted by the latter so as to pass through the shutter opening and affect the cell so that relay 330 is operated and a signal is given by buzzer 360. A forward circuit for the cell is shown. 
 If, on the other hand, the number just entered is not one which has been initially registered in the machine, no light is permitted to pass through frame 33 due to the fact that the movable shield plates therein have no apertures in alignment. 'When' the machine is to be cleared the operator presses on the hand bar 2% so that the shaft 26! is rocked in aclockwise direction, spring 268 being compressed. Hereupon, spring 389, Figure 8, acts to move contact finger 335 downwardly to break the circuit to relay I72 and bulb 2H5, Figure 16. The armature being released, rod I98'moves to the right under the force of spring and pawl 209 rides into normal position'in recess 24'! of bell crank lever 263. Simultaneously shaft 252, Figure 9, has been rocked through arm 260, link 259 and arm 258, see also Figure 7, thus moving arm 25'! from beneath the engaged pin 238 and permitting the latter to come to rest on the extremity of arm 246 of bell crank lever 244. At the same instant roller 226 snaps off of the engaged cam 23'! and shutter 224, through its spring, is instantaneously closed. This is desirable since, as will be described, the movable shield plates are simultaneously being moved out of frame 33 and due to the lag of lamp 2H5 light might reach the cell 233 were it not for the quick actuation of the shutter. 
 As arm 210 rises, cam block 288, Figure 5, swings lever 293 to rock yoke I40 in the manner heretofore described so that the-ratchet wheel in is engaged by the spring-pressed pawl l59, Figure 3. Shaft 214 is rocked in a counter-clockwise direction and thus forces bar 211 to move inia clockwise direction about shaft 29, Figure 2, thus returning all the actuated shield plates to their normal position wherein they rest on bar 32. As'the shield plates move to normal position their heel portions cam the plates 18 and 92 rearwardly so that rods 16 and M are carried rearwardly until stop pins 13 and 81 again come into blocking relation thereto. In the meantime arm time riding freely over the teeth of ratchet I28.- 
As slide I00 reaches its left hand limit position, theroller 294 rides off of the lower edge of cam block 288 and the consequent movement of lever 293 releases arm I42 for upward movement, yoke I40 thereupon swinging in a counter-clockwise- The rocking of shaft 252, in addition to moving arm 25'! in the mannerabove described, also causes arm 253 to swing toward the front of the machine, Figure 9, carrying latch 254 so that disc 235 is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction, winding the torsion spring 24L As pawl 254 completes its stroke the dog 240a engages behind the succeeding pin 240 on disc 239. Upon release of the hand bar 266 all the parts thereby actuated are returned to the normal positions illustrated by means of their associated springs. 
 In describing the operation of the machine as above, it has been assumed that a six place number has been registered in the machine and again entered in the subsequent operation of the machine. In the case of a number of less than six places it is evident that the slide I00 will not reach its right hand limit position so as to close switch l'lii, iii, since the slide is stepped to the right from its initial position only by a number of steps equal to the number of numeral keys which have been depressed. It is for this reason 20 that the blocking keys 1, 2 and 3 have been provided, these keys being actuatable to close switches 299 and 363 across conductors 3H and 3l8 when the number entered in the machine is less than six places. 
 For example, if the number to be registered in the machine is 8M8, after the 8 key has been pressed the second time, the number 1 blocking key is depressed since the number includes only one numeral after the letter. The number 1 blocking key has a shield plate 36 associated therewith in exactly the same manner as the letter keys and after its depression the hot rod or wire is run through block 33 in the manner above described. In the subsequent'operation of 35 the machine as the number 8M8 is again entered, the number 1 blocking key will also be depressed and a through opening will be provided so that the photo-electric cell will be activated. The number 2 and number 3 blocking keys likewise have shield plates associated therewith and are used respectively when the number to be registered includes two or three numerals after the letter. It will be seen that if it were not for these blocking keys if the registered number were 8M8496 the photo-electric cell would be affected not only when the full number was again entered in the machine, but also when the first three, four or five places thereof were entered. 
 Due to the fact that each number key can select five separate shield plates it will be evident that the same numeral can be repeated five times in the same numbenas for example in 8M8888, and each time another shield plate will be moved into the block 33. Also no confusion can result in the case of reversed numbers as in the case of 8M4 and 4M8. In-enteringthe number 8M4, upon depression of thenumber 8 key the first one of the group of stop pins associated therewith would be lifted while the third one of the group of stop pins associated with the number 4 key would be lifted. In the case of the number 4M8 the first stop pin of the group associated with the number 4 key would be lifted and-the third stop pin of the group associated with the number 8 key would be lifted. It will thus be'seenthat in the case .of these-two numbers entirelyv different shield platesare affected by the number 4 and 8 keys. For each number set in the machine there is a sub-group of swingable plates having apertures which are in alignment only with each other in their limit position. Each sub-group consists of a maximum number of six swingable plates in the disclosed machine, although the sub-group-may be composed of a lesser number, as for example, 75 
when the number 8M8 is set in the machine. In this case, the shield plate associated with the number 1 blocking key forms a member of the sub-group since it is perforated in alignment with the other plates at the ,original'setting. However, if the number 8M8888 is set up in the machine and the number 8M8 is subsequently entered without having been previously set up, the actuated plates do not comprise a sub-group nor is the blocking plate, which now exercises a blocking function, a member of the sub-group. In each operating cycle of the machine, a number may be entered which may or may not affect a predetermined sub-group of plates and, as explained, a sub-group may comprise the predetermined maximum of six plates or a lesser number of plates. 
 Upon removal of the cover portion 26, and upon detaching shaft 29 from side plates 24 and 25, the block' 33, Figure 2, may be bodily removed without interference from the cross members, 3| and 31, bar 21'! moving out of the open upper ends of arms 215 and 216. There is no interference of the heel portions of plates 36 with the plates 18 and 92, since there is only an abutment relation of the latter. The block is removed in this manner when it is necessary to replace plates 36. 
In the use of the machine just described, it will ordinarily be mounted in an automobile so as to be readily transportable to strategic positions and the position may be chosen without refer-- unit being self-contained in this respect. In the present machine signaling means only is provided 'to show that a number previously registered has been entered in the machine, it being assumed that the operator will remember the number just set and, will thus be able to take the necessary steps. However, if desired, recording mechanism may be provided so that each number entered will be visible at least until the machine is cleared. 
 As intimated at the outset the invention is not limited in its application to machines of any particular capacity and the machine which has been specifically described may be appropriately enlarged where required. For example, each number key may be associated with groups of more than five stop pins so as to be able to handle numbers wherein the same numeral is apt to be repeated more than flve times. Also, if in any particular case letters are apt to be repeated in the same indicia, each letter key may be provided with selective facilities such as herein have been described only in association with the number keys. 
 Thus, the machine of the present invention is susceptible of considerable variation as to the form and relation of its parts and as to capacity. Accordingly, the invention is not 'to be considered as limited by the specific disclosure herein, its scope being determined in the following claims.
