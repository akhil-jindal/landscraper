52 Claims. 
 This invention relates to improvements in accounting machines of the type illustrated and described in Letters Patent of the United States F No. 1,203,863, issued November 7, 1916 to Halcolm Ellis and U. S. Patent No. 1,819,084 issued August 18, 1931 to Emil John Ens. 
 As disclosed in the instant invention, the Ellis type accounting machine is equipped with a traveling carriage and typewriter keyboard in addi- 10 tion to the regular adding machine keyboard. However the typewriter attachment is a matter of choice and may be omitted where the business system does not demand it. 
 In order to better adapt the Ellis machine for use by large department stores, banks, public utility companies and the like, who issue periodical statements to a plurality of customers certain novel improvements were provided, particularly in the traveling carrier and platen controlling 20 mechanisms. 
 Therefore, it is broadly an object of this invention to incorporate in a machine of the type referred to various improvements to increase its utility and flexibility so that it may be easily 25 adapted for use in the majority of modern business concerns. 
 A more specific object is to provide novel means for selectively controlling the traveling carriage and platen mechanisms of accounting machines. 
 Another object is to provide means to return the traveling carriage to certain predetermined positions and simultaneously release the machine for operation and initiate the platen feed. 
 Still another object is to provide means to lock 35 the selective controlling and traveling carriage returning means during a part of machine operation. 
 A further object is to contrive means to skiptabulate the traveling carriage. 
 A still further object is to supply adjustable stops for use in connection with the selective controlling means and the skip-tabulating means. 
 Another object of this invention is to provide means to release the machine for operation by depressing certain control keys. 
 Still another object is to contrive means whereby the traveling carriage in tabulated positions controls depression of certain control keys. 
 Other objects of the instant invention are: to devise means to control the mechanism that feeds the, platen upon return of the traveling carriage 55 nisms, and to provide means to effectuate the platen feeding mechanism by means of the traveling carriage in tabulated positions thereof. 
 With these and incidental objects in View, the invention includes certain novel features of construction and combinations of parts, the essential elements of which are set forth in appended claims and a preferred form or embodiment of which is hereinafter described with reference to the drawings which accompany and form a part of this specification.

General description An accounting machine to be successfully used in present-day businesses must not only be rugged and free from mechanical defects but the success of such a machine depends largely upon such vital factors as accuracy, speed and ease of operation. In accomplishing these results, various improvements have been made in the traveling carriage, platen roll, and machine controlling mechanisms, and it is to these improvements that the present invention is directed. 
 In its present embodiment the instant machine is shown adapted for use by large department stores where charge accounts of a great number of individuals are carried from month to month. However, it is not desired to limit the machine of this invention to the particular use cited above as the previously mentioned improvements widen the scope and increase the flexibility of the machine to the extent that it may easily be adapted for use in most any business where it is necessary to frequently balance individual accounts and to make out statement slips or bills to be sent to a plurality of individual customers or patrons. 
 In the machine of the present invention three touch bars have been provided for returning the traveling carriage to different columnar positions. These touch bars control mechanism that cooperates with a plurality of stops adjustably mounted at the rear of the traveling carriage in the desired columnar positions. In conventional machines it is customary to tabulate the traveling carriage from an extreme right hand position in successive steps toward the left after which the traveling carriage is again returned to starting position. However, in the instant machine, in addition to the customary tabulation from right to left it is also possible by means of the mechanism outlined above to return the traveling carriage from tabulated positions to predetermined columnar positions. 
 In order to prevent the operator from depressing one of the carriage return touch bars before printing is complete, mechanism is provided for locking said touch bars against depression until after the impression is made. 
 In addition to returning the traveling carriage to a predetermined columnar position the return bar illustrated in Fig. 13 also depresses the vertical feed bar to cause the platen roll to be linespaced. 
 The instant machine is equipped with a skiptabulating touch bar, depression of which releases the machine for operation and simultanecusly locks the tabulating stop bars against movement into the path of the tabulating stops cated at the front of the traveling carriage. Oiher stops located at the back of the traveling a riage unlock the tabulating stop bars allowng them to move upwardly into the path of the nroper tabulating stop after the traveling car riage skip-tabulates to the desired columnar position. 
 The skip tabulating mechanism is so arranged that when the skip tabulating touch bar is depressed and the weight of the hand immediately removed therefrom the tabulating stop bars will be unlocked by a certain type of stop located at the rear of the traveling carriage, and when the eight of the hand is allowed to remain on the skip tabulating touch bar the first mentioned stops have no effect but the traveling carriage continues to skip tabulate until another type of stop unlocks the tabulating stop bars. 
 In the instant machine depressing the regular starting bar causes the traveling carriage to be tabulated from one column to the next without imparting any feeding movement to the platen roll. However, an auxiliary starting bar known as the vertical feed starting bar has been incorporated in the instant machine, which when depressed prevents tabulation of the traveling carriage and causes the platen roll to be rotated to line-space the record material wound therearound. Stops located on the traveling carriage, cooperating with the above mechanism, cause the platen roll to be line-spaced when the regular motor bar is used to release the machine for operation. 
 The balance key of the instant machine in addition to conditioning the balance totalizer for clearing operations also by means of mechanism shown in Fig. '7 releases the machine for operation by depressing the regular starting bar. A novel non-repeat mechanism prevents repetition of operation when the balance key is inadvertently retained depressed. In order to prevent the balance key being depressed before the traveling carriage has had time to tabulate to the balance column, mechanism has been provided to lock the balance key against depression until the balance column is alined with the printing mechanism. A stop on the traveling carriage cooperating with a hanging bar lever then unlocks the balance key. 
The mechanism briefly outlined above, and 
other mechanism of the machine pertinent to the instant invention will now be described in detail. 
Detailed description The mechanism of the machine of the present invention is supported between a left side frame 39 and a right side frame 3| (Figs. 1, 8 and 10) in turn secured to a machine base 32. Enclosing the mechanism of the machine is a case 33, which is also secured to the base 32. The back of a traveling carriage 34 is supported for horizontal movement on the case 33 by means of a lower ball race 35 secured to the case 33 and an upper ball race 36 secured to the frame of the traveling carriage and a plurality of ball bearings 31 interposed between the two races. The front of the traveling carriage 34 is supported by means of rollers which bear on the top surface of a guide rail 38 secured to the case 33. The traveling carriage is prevented from tipping up in front by means for rollers 39 cooperating with the bottom surface of the rail 38. After the traveling carriage 34 has been properly assembled on the machine case 33 a plurality of brackets not shown, 
 are secured to said traveling carriage and cooperate with an undercut portion of the race 35 to retain the traveling carriage in place on the case 33. 
 The traveling carriage 34 (Fig. 10) carries a platen roll 49 which swings upwardly away from printing position so that record material may be inserted in the front thereof and pushed around the platen roll until the proper line thereof is in printing position. For a full disclosure of the front feed platen mechanism see co-pending application of Raymond A. Christian, Serial Number 653,838, filed January 27, 1933. 
Machine keyboard and operating mechanism The machine of this invention has a plurality of denominational rows of amount keys 4|, one of such denomination rows being illustrated in Fig. 1. The amount keys 4| are depressibly mounted by means of a top keyboard plate 42 having therein slots adapted to loosely support the upper end of said amount keys and by means of studs 43 secured in the lower ends of said amount keys cooperating with vertical slots in one of the keyboard side plates 44. The amount keys 4| are flexible in that after one key has been depressed in a particular row depressing another key in that same row releases the first key depressed and so on. Each amount key 4| has a spring 45 adapted to return and retain said amount keys in their upward positions upon release thereof. 
 Depression of one of the amount keys 4| moves the stud 43 carried thereby into the path of one of a series of graduated steps 46 on an amount rack 41 mounted for horizontal reciprocating movement by means of a rod 48 and a bar 49 supported by the main frames 30 and 3|. The amount rack 41 has therein a vertical slot 50 which embraces a stud secured in a segment 52 loose on a leading frame shaft 53, opposite ends of which are journaled in the frames 30 and 3|. A spring 54 urges a projection 55 of the segment 5?. into contact with the forward edge of a leading frame bail 56 extending between a pair of arms-51 secured on the shaft 53. 
 Secured on the right hand end of the shaft 53 (Fig. is a plate 58 having therein a cam slot 59 adapted to cooperate with a roller 60 carried by an arm 6| secured on a main drive shaft 62, journaled in the frames 30 and 3|. The arm 6| has pivoted thereto the upper end of a link 63 (Fig. 3) the lower end of which is pivoted to the driven member of a motor clutch (not shown). The driving member of the motor clutch is geared to the usual constantly running electric motor 11 which is secured beneath the base 32. 
 Located on the right hand side of the keyboard is the usual starting bar 64 (Figs. 3 and '1) having stems 65 and 66 which extend through openings in an auxiliary keyboard plate 18 and are pivoted respectively to a plate 61 pivoted on a stud 68 secured in the frame 3|, and an extension 69 of a lever 10 loose on a stud 1| also carried by the frame 3|. The plate 61 carries a stud 12 which cooperates with the bifurcated end of an extension 13 of the lever 10. Another extension 14 of the lever 10 carries a stud which cooperates with the clutch release mechanism in the well known manner as shown and described in the patent of the United States No. 1,601,102 issued to F. W. Bernau on September 28, 1926. 
 Depressing the starting bar 64 (Fig. 3) rocks the plate 61 counter-clockwise against the tension of a spring 16, which in cooperation with the stem 66 of said starting bar rocks the lever 10 in a clockwise direction to move the stud 15 out of the path of the clutch releasing mechanism. This connects the clutch driven member to the driving member in the well known manner thereby causing both members to be revolved in unison by the motor. After the clutch driven member completes one revolution of movement it is automatically declutched from the clutch driving member and the starting bar 64 is simultaneously restored upwardly to normal position. Revolution of the clutch driven member as explained above by means of the link 63 rocks the arm 6| and the shaft 62 first counter-clock wise and then back to normal position through an approximate angle of sixty degrees. This by means of the roller 60 (Fig. 10) in cooperation with the cam slot 59 rocks the plate 58 and the shaft 53 first in a clockwise direction and then back to normal position. Maximum counterclockwise movement of the plate 58 is indicated by the dot and dash outline of said plate in Fig. 10. 
 By referring to Fig. 1 it is obvious that any movement of the shaft 53 is transmitted by means of the arms 51 to the bail 56 of the leading frame. Initial movement counter-clockwise of the bail 56 by means of the spring 54 causes the segment 52 to move in unison therewith which by means of the stud 5| and the slot 50 causes the amount rack 41 to move rearwardly until one of the graduated steps 46 engages the stud 43 of the depressed amount key 4|. This prevents further rearward movement of the amount rack 41 and the segment 52, consequently the bail 56 com pletes its rearward movement independently thereof flexing the spring 54. In its return movement clockwise the bail 56 picks up the segment 52 and returns said segment and the amount rack 41 to their normal or zero positions. In case no amount key is depressed the zero stop lever retains the rack 41 in its zero position, as shown in Fig. ,1 during machine operations. 
 The amount keys 4! position the rack 41 in the manner just described in adding and subtracting operations. In totalizing operations the proper denominational wheel of the selected totalizer positions the rack 41 commensurate with the amount on said totalizer wheel in a manner presently to be described. 
Totalizers In its present embodiment the machine of the instant invention is equipped with two totalizers, an upper add-subtract or No. 1 totalizer and a lower adding or No. 2 totalizer (Fig. 1), however it is merely a matter of assembly to equip the instant machine with additional totalizers. The No. 1 and No. 2 totalizers have respectively a plurality of wheels 89 and 8|, only one of each here shown, adapted to be rocked into mesh with teeth 82 and 83 of the amount rack 41 in the usual manner. 
 In adding operations after the rack 41 has completed its initial movement rearwardly and has been properly positioned by one of the amount keys 4|, as explained above, an alining bar 84 connected by a pair of arms 85 to a shaft 86 is rocked into engagement with teeth 81 of the segment 52 to retain said segment and the amount rack 41 in their set position. Following this the corresponding wheel of the selected totalizer or totalizers is rocked into mesh with said rack, return movement forwardly of which retates the wheel commensurate with the value of the depressed amount key. 
 In subtracting operations the corresponding wheel of the No. 1 or balance totalizer is rocked into engagement with the teeth 82 of the rack 4'! before said rack starts its initial movement rearwardly. Initial movement rearwardly of the rack 41 revolves the wheel of the No. 1 or balance totalizer in a reverse or counter-clockwise direction until said rack 41 is stopped by the depressed amount key, as explained earlier herein. After the leading frame bail 56 and the rack 41 complete their initial movement rearwardly the wheel of the balance totalizer is disengaged from said rack 41. This results in the value of the depressed amount key being subtracted from the balance totalizer. 
 The wheels 80 (Fig. 1) of the No. 1 totalizer each carry a tripping plate 89 with diametrically opposed tripping teeth which cooperate with add transfer pawls 89 and subtract transfer pawls 90 to transfer amounts from lower to higher denominations and to position the racks 41 in to talizing operations in a manner presently to be described. In adding operations the add transfer pawls 89 are rocked into the path of the teeth of the tripping plates 88 and the subtract pawls 90 are simultaneously rocked out of the path of the teeth of said tripping plates. In subtracting operations the subtract transfer pawls 90 are moved into the path of the teeth of the tripping plate 88 and the add transfer pawls 89 are moved out of the path of said teeth. 
 Referring to Fig. 1, which as previously stated depicts the mechanism for one denominational unit, in adding operations when either of the teeth of the tripping plate 88 wipes past the tripping point of the adding transfer pawl 89 the transfer mechanism for the next higher denomination is tripped, thus causing one to be added in said next higher denomination. In subtract operations when one of the teeth of the tripping plate 88 wipes past the subtract transfer pawl 90 the transfer mechanism for the next higher denomination is tripped, thus causing one to be subtracted from said higher denomination. 
 In totalizing operations the wheel 80 is engaged with the rack 41 prior to its initial move ment rearwardly, which movement rotates said wheel 80 in a reverse or counter-clockwise direction until one of the teeth of the tripping plate 88 engages the inner surface of the tripping point of the add transfer pawl 89. This arrests the movement of the wheel 80 and positions the rack 41 and the segment 52 commensurate with the amount on said wheel 90. The wheel 80 is now in zero position and if the operation is a clearing or resetting operation it is disengaged from the amount rack 41 before said rack starts its return movement forwardly. In reading or subtotalizing operations the wheel 80 remains in engagement with the rack 41 during its return movement forwardly, consequently the amount is replaced thereon, 
 Each of the wheels SI of the No. 2 totalizer carries a transfer tripping plate 9| similar to the plates 88 for the No. 1 totalizer wheels and having diametrically opposed teeth which cooperate with the tripping point of the No. 2 add transfer pawls 92 in adding and totalizing operations in exactly the same manner as described for the No. 1 totalizer. 
Printing mechanism 98 has another projection IOI which cooperates with a zero elimination hook I02 loose on a shaft I03 supported by the printer frame. The hook I02 has a downward extension with an arcuate surface I04 which cooperates with a stud I05 carried by an extension I06 of the segment 52. Tensioned between a pawl IU'I carried by the arm 96 and the bail of a yoke I08 secured on the shaft 91 is a spring I09 which actuates the printing segment 95 and the arm 96 in a manner presently to be described. 
 Directing attention to Figs. 3 and 7 the printer shaft 91 has secured on the right hand end thereof an arm IIO pivotally supporting an arm III, flexibly connected thereto by means of a spring H2. The arm III has. pivoted thereto the upper end of a link lI3 having in its lower end a slot which normally engages a stud H4 carried by the main drive arm GI. 
 In adding, subtracting and totalizing operations, which require a single cycle of movement of the arm GI and the shaft 52 the link II3 remains operatively engaged with the stud IM to oscillate the printer shaft 91 first in a clockwise direction and then back to normal position, as shown in Fig. 3. In the beginning of an overdraft operation which requires three cycles of movement of the arm GI and the shaft 62, the link I I3 is disconnected from the stud H4 during the first two cycles of such overdraft operation and reconnected therewith during the last cycle of operation. This prevents unnecessary operation of the printer mechanism. When the link I I3 is disconnected from the stud I I4 a notch I I5 in the rear edge thereof engages a stud I I6 in the right frame 3| to secure the printer mechanism against movement. 
 In adding, subtracting and totalizing operations initial movement rearwardly of the segment 52 (Fig. 1) and the amount rack 41 under and in influence of the leading frame bail 56 by means of the link 94 positions the printing segment 95 commensurate with the position of the amount rack 41. When the bail 56 reaches the terminus of its rearward movement it dwells slightly in this position and during this dwell clockwise movement of the shaft 91 and the yoke I08 rocks the release trigger I counter-clockwise to release the arm 96 and the printing segment 95 to the action of the spring I09 which has been given added tension by clockwise movement of the bail I08. The spring I09 urges the arm 96 and the segment 95 clockwise, causing said segment to make an impression upon material wound around the platen roll 40. Return movement counter-clockwise of the shaft 91 and the bail I08 restores the arm 96 and the printing segment 95 to the position shown in Fig. 1. 
 Whenever the segment 52 moves out of zero position the stud I in cooperation with the arcuate surface I04 of the zero elimination hook I02 rocks said hook a slight distance counterclockwise to disengage it from the projection IOI of the plate 98 thereby allowing the printing mechanism for that denomination to function. This counter-clockwise movement of the zero elimination hook I02 is imparted to the zero elimination hook of the next lower denomination when its segment 52 is retained in zero position. This allows the zeros of the lower order denominations to print and prevents the zeros of the higher order denominations from printing. When the segment 52 is returned to zero position, as shown in Fig. 1, a spring II1 restores the zero elimination hook I02 clockwise so that it engages the projection IOI of the plate 98. 
irecting attention to Fig. 2, a row of control keys H8 and a No. 1 add key II9 located on the left hand side of the keyboard control the functions of the totalizers. The functions of the totalizers are also controlled by means of stops I (Fig. '1) in cooperation with the usual hanging bar levers. The stops I20 are adjustably supported in predetermined columnar positions by a stop bar I2I secured to the front of the traveling carriage 34. 
Traveling carriage mechanism As previously brought out, the machine of this invention is provided with a traveling carriage similar to that used on typewriters. The traveling carriage is adapted to be tabulated from column to column, and means. are also provided to skip-tabulate the traveling carriage through one or more columnar positions at a time. Selectively controlled mechanism is provided to automatically return the traveling carriage from any tabulated position to an extreme right hand or starting position, or to other predetermined columnar positions. Mechanism is also provided to simultaneously effectuate the automatic platen feeding mechanism, the machine releasing mechanism, and the selective carriage returning mechanism simultaneously. Depression of the balance key is also controlled by columnar positions of the traveling carriage, and in addition means are provided whereby depression of the balance key releases the machine for operation. The traveling carriage mechanism will now be described in detail. 
Traveling carriage tabulating and platen roll feeding mechanisms Referring to Figs. 3 and 7, the extension 69 of the lever 10 has therein a stud I22 which loosely supports the lower end of the stem 66 of the machine starting bar 64 and also pivotally supports a link I23 bifurcated to embrace a stud I24 in a lever I25 loose on a stud I26 fast in the frame 3I. An upward extension I30 of the lever I25 cooperates with a right-angled projection I3I of a tabulating control bar I32 loosely supported by a slotted stud secured in the frame 3I. The bar I32 has a downward extension I33 adapted to shield a stud I34 secured in a tabulating lever I35 pivoted on a stud I36 secured in the right frame 3I. Pivoted on the link II3 (Fig. 7) is a hook I31 which cooperates with the stud I34 and has a projection I38 which is urged clockwise into engagement with the edge of the link I I3 by a spring I39. 
 It will be recalled that during operation of the machine the link II3 moves upwardly and then back to normal position to operate the printer shaft 91. A spring I44 is tensioned to urge the bar I32 toward the left to normally maintain the extension I33 thereof in position to shield the stud I34 from the hook I31. With the parts in the positions shown in Fig. 7, when the link I I3 moves up and down during machine operations, the hook I31 rides idly over the extension I33 and is thereby prevented from engaging the stud I34. 
 Loose on the stud I26 and flexibly connected to the lever I25 by a spring I45 is an arm I46, a right-angled projection I41 of which is adapted to coact with a stud I48 in a bar I49 slidably supported upon studs I50 and I5I secured in the right printer frame. A hook I52 of the bar I49 cooperates with a stud I53 in a pawl I54 loose on an arm I55 secured on a shaft I56 journaled in downwardly extending ears of a cross frame I 51 extending between the frames 30 and 3|. Another arm I58 secured on the shaft I56 has pivoted thereto a link I59 adjustably supporting a paper feed hook I60 with a downward projection I6I which cooperates with the rolled edge of a feed bail I62 supported by a plurality of arms I63 secured on a shaft I64 journaled in the traveling carriage frame. The hook I60 is pivoted on a screw stud I65 carried by the link I59 and is secured against movement by means of a nut I66 threaded on said screw. The projection I6I may be adjusted in relation to the rolled lower edge of the bail I62 by means of a screw I61 threaded in a projecting ear of the hook I60 and secured against movement by means of a lock nut I68. The end of the screw I61 cooperates with a right-angled projection of a plate I69 secured to the link I 59. 
 Secured in the left hand arm I63 in a stud I10 extending through a slot in a link I1I pivoted on an arm I12 loose on a shaft I13 which carries the platen roll 40 and which is rotatably supported by the traveling carriage frame. Turnably supported by the arm I12 is a feed pawl I14 urged into engagement with the teeth of a ratchet I15 secured on the shaft I13 by a spring I16. A spring I urges the arm I12 counter-clockwise to return the pawl I14 to normal position after feeding takes place. 
 Depressing the starting bar 64 rocks the plate 61 counter-clockwise and the lever 10 clockwise to move the link I23 downwardly. This allows thelever I 25 to be rocked counter-clockwise by a spring I8I causing the arm I30 of said lever to engage the extension I3I of the bar I32 to move the downward extension I33 thereof out of the path of the hook I31. The spring I45 transmits the counter-clockwise movement of the lever I25 to the arm I46 to move the bar I49 forwardly. 
The hook I52 of said bar, in cooperation with the stud I53 rocks the pawl I54 counter-clockwise against the tension of a spring I82. This moves the lower notched end I83 of the pawl I54 out of the path of a stud I84 in an arm I secured on the shaft 91. Consequently during operation of the machine the arm I85 moves idly first clockwise and then back to normal position. During machine operation upward movement of the link I I3 (Fig. 7) causes the hook I31 to latch over the unprotected stud I34 and after impression is complete downward movement of said link I I3 causes the hook I31 to pull the lever I35 downwardly to tabulate the traveling carriage in a manner later to be described. When the lever I35 reaches the terminus of its downward movement the stud I33 moves out of the path of the hook I31 which oompletes its downward movement independently thereof. 
 Near the end of machine operation the starting bar 84, the plate 51 and the levers 10 and I25 are restored to normal positions, as shown in Fig. '7. The spring I44 then returns the bar I32 toward the left so that the extension I33 again protects the stud I34 from the hook I31 and the spring I82 returns the bar I49 and the pawl I 54 so that the notched end of said pawl is again in the path of the stud I84 in the arm I85. 
 A vertical feed bar I86 has a stem I81 which extends through an opening in the auxiliary keyboard plate 18 and is slotted at its lower end to embrace the stud I22 in the arm 89 of the lever 10. The stem I81 carries a stud I88 which cooperates with a projection I89 of an arm I90 loose on the stud H and having an arcuate surface I9I arranged to move under the. stud I24 to block the counter-clockwise movement of the lever I25. A spring I92 urges the arm I90 counterclockwise which by means of the projection I89 in cooperation with the stud I88 normally maintains the bar I86 upwardly in the position here shown. 
 When the vertical starting bar I86 is depressed the stud I88 in cooperation with the projection I89 rocks the arm I90 clockwise, causing the arcuate surface I9I to pass under the stud I24 to block movement of the lever I 25. After this the vertical bar stem I81 in cooperation with the stud I22 rocks the lever 10 clockwise to release the machine for operation in the usual manner. Obviously the arm I48 imparts no movement to the bar I49 consequently the notched end I83 of the pawl I54 remains in the path of the stud I84 in the arm I 85 and when the shaft 91 and the arm I85 receive their initial clockwise movement the stud I84 wipes by the notched lower end of the pawl I54. When the shaft 91 and the arm I85 are being returned counter-clockwise the stud I84 engages the notched end of the pawl I54 to rock the arm I55 the shaft I58 and arm I 58 clockwise. This moves the link I59 and the hook I60 downwardly, causing the projection I6I to engage the curled lower edge of the bail I62 to rock the arm I53 clockwise which by means of the link I1I rocks the arm I12 also clockwise. This causes the pawl I14 to engage the ratchet I15 to rotate the platen roll 40 clockwise to line-space record material wound there-around. When sufficient feeding movement has been imparted to the platen a tail I93 of the pawl I54 engages an eccentric I94 secured to the printer frame to disengage the notch I83 from the stud I84. A 
spring I95 then returns the arm I 58, shaft I 56 and associated parts to normal positions as here shown. 
 The usual means is provided for controlling the extent of feeding movement imparted to the platen roll 40. Loose on the shaft I13 (Fig. 7) is a lever I96 with a radial surface I91 which cooperates with a stud I98 in the feed pawl I14. When the spring I80 returns the arm I12 and associated parts to normal positions after feeding is completed the stud I 98 rides upon the radial surface I91 to disengage the pawl I14 from the ratchet I15. By manipulating the lever I98 the moment of engagement of the pawl I14 with the ratchet I15 may be varied to control the feeding movement of the platen roll 40. 
 It is evident that when no movement is imparted to the lever I25 (Fig. 7) the bar I32 remains in its left hand position to cause the extension I33 thereof to protect the stud I34 from the hook I31. Therefore normally when the vertical feed bar I88 is used the traveling carriage remains stationary unless it is tabulated by hand in the well known manner or unless the bar I32 is moved to ineffective position by the usual manipulative means. 
 Still referring to Fig. 7, when the traveling carriage 34 is so positioned that an extension I99 of the stop I20 engages a plunger 208 free in a hole in the machine case. 32 and loosely connected to an upward extension 28I of the bar I49 forward movement of said bar I49 and the arm I46 is blocked. Consequently when the machine is released by means of the bar 64 the lever I25 moves counter-clockwise independently of the lower end thereof forming a hook 294 arranged to cooperate with the stud I24 in the lever I25. As here shown the lever 203 is in ineffective position. Moving the lever counter-clockwise to its effective position causes the hook 204 to engage the stud I 24 to prevent counter-clockwise movement of the lever I 25 irrespective of the downward movement of the link I23. Obviously this causes the vertical feed mechanism to function regardless of the use of the starting bar 64. 
Skip tabulating mechanism The machine of this invention is provided with novel mechanism which skip-tabulates the traveling carriage through a number of columnar positions to predetermined columnar positions. Depressing the skip tabulating bar releases the machine for operation and simultaneously latches the tabulating stop bars so that they cannot be moved upwardly into the path of the tabulating stops on the traveling carriage. This allows the traveling carriage to tabulate until stops located in predetermined columnar positions at the back of the traveling carriage release the tabulating stop bars so that they may be spring-urged into the path of the tabulating stops. 
 Two types of stops are used in connection with the skip-tabulating mechanism, one of which functions when the skip-tabulating bar is depressed and the weight of the hand immediately removed therefrom, but is ineffective when the skip-tabulating bar is retained depressed. The other type of stop functions either when the hand is removed from the skip-tabulating bar immediately after depression or when the skip-tabulating bar is retained depressed. Thus by holding down the skip-tabulating bar the first type of stop is rendered ineffective and the traveling carriage will tabulate until one of the latter stops releases the tabulating stop bars. The skiptabulating mechanism will now be described in detail. 
 Directing attention to Figs. '1, 19 and 20, the tabulating lever 135 has therein an opening adapted to receive the foot of a lever 205 pivoted on a tabulating frame 206 which extends between the main frames 30 and 3|. The lever 205 cooperates with a lever 201 pivoted on a stud 208 secured in the frame 206. The lever 201 has a raised surface 209 which cooperates with a stud 210 in an escapement control plunger 211 supported for vertical sliding movement in a groove in an extension 212 of the frame 206. A spring 213 is tensioned to urge the lever 201 counter-clockwise to normally maintain an upper raised portion 214 thereof in contact with the lower surface of the extension 212. 
 The lever 201 (Fig. 20) carries a stud 215 which extends through a slot 216 in a tabulating stop bar 211 the upper end of which is loosely supported in a vetrical groove in the tabulating frame 206. The right edge of the bar 211 as here observed cooperates with a rounded projection 218 of a latch 219 pivoted to the frame 206. A torsion spring 220 urges the latch 219 clockwise into contact with a stud 221 carried by the lever 201. A torsion spring 222 cooperates with a stud 223 in the bar 211 to urge said bar upwardly to normally maintain the lower end of the slot 216 in contact with the stud 215. 
 Pivoted on the stud 208 (Fig. 19) is a lever 224 with an enlarged portion 225 arranged to cooperate with the pin 210 in the plunger 211. A torsion spring 226 urges the lever 224 counterclockwise to normally maintain an upwardly extending portion 230 thereof in contact with the lower surface of the extension 212. A stud 231 pivotally connects the lever 224 to an escapement control bar 232 supported in the same vertical groove as the bar 211 and urged counterclockwise by a spring 221. The pin 223 in the bar 211 extends through an opening 233 in the bar 232. The bar 232 has a recess 234 with a notch 235 therein which cooperates with a square stud 236 in a stop plate 231 pivoted at 238 to the tabulating frame 206 and maintained in contact with a stud 239 by a spring 240. 
 Directing attention to Fig. 3, after impression is complete, clockwise or downward movement of the tabulating lever 135, effected either manually by means of the tabulating keys or automatically by means of the hook 131, rocks the lever 205 counter-clockwise as observed in Figs. 19 and 20. The lever 205 imparts a clockwise movement to the lever 201, the spring 222 in cooperation with the stud 223 lifts the bar 211 upwardly until its upper end is in the path of the tabulating stop 120. The latch 219 influenced by the spring 220, hooks over the stud 221 to retain the lever 201 in its moved position. The hump 218 of the latch 219 engages and rocks the bar 211 into contact with the left hand side of the enlarged groove in the tabulating frame 206. Clockwise movement of the lever 201 also moves the escapement control plunger 211 downwardly. Any 
suitable form of escapement mechanism may be employed to control the tabulating movement of the carriage. One form of such mechanism is shown in Figs. 19-A and l9-B and will now be described. Downward movement of the plunger 211 (Fig. 19A) by means of an aperture in the lower end thereof in cooperation with the tail of a bell crank 410, pivoted on a brackat 411 secured in the frame 206, rocks said bell crank counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise movement of the bell crank 410, by means of a connecting link 412, imparts clockwise movement to a bell crank 413 pivoted at 414 to the cross frame 151. The bell crank 413, which is connected by a link 415 to one arm of the yoke 416 loose on a shaft 411 journaled in the frame 151, transmits its clockwise movement to said yoke 416. Clockwise movement of the yoke 416 causes an extension 418 (Fig. 19B) thereof to rock the tooth of a spring urged escapement retaining pawl 419 out of mesh with the teeth of an escapement ratchet 400 to free the traveling carriage for tabulating movement. The pawl 41!] is pivoted on a stud 481 in the frame 151 and the ratchet 480 is secured on the lower end of a shaft 482 journaled in a bushing 463 threaded in the frame 151. The escapement ratchet 480 is connected to the traveling carriage by means of a pinion 484 which is secured to the upper end of the shaft 482 and said pinion 484 meshes with a rack 485 secured to depending lugs of the traveling carriage frame 34. The traveling carriage is now free to tabulate toward the right, as observed in Fig. 19, under the influence of a conventional type of spring-urged drum 486 (Fig. 10) mounted on the case 33 and connected by a cable 481 to a stud 488 secured in the carriage frame 34. As the bar 211 moves upwardly the stud 223 cooperating with the slot 233 lifts the bar 232 and the lever 224 upwardly in unison therewith. From the above it is obvious that the spring 222 is strong enough to overcome the action of the springs 226 and 221. Near the terminus of the upward movement of the bar 232 the spring 221 urges said bar toward the left to latch the notch 235 over the stud 236 in the plate 231. 
 While the traveling carriage is tabulating toward the right as viewed in Fig. 19, the stop engages first the upper end of the bar 211 which protrudes farther toward the left than the upper end of the bar 232. The impact of the traveling carriage is absorbed by the bar 211 which is forced against the right side of the groove in the frame 206. toward the right releases the latch 219 from the stud 221 in the lever 201. This sudden stop causes the traveling carriage to rebound slightly and during this rebounding the spring 213 returns the levers 201 and 205 and the bar 211 downwardly to normal position, thus removing the upper end of said bar 211 from the path of the traveling carriage stop 120. It will be noted that the bar 232 has not thus far been engaged by the stop 120 and therefore remains in its upward position which by means of the enlarged portion 225 of the lever 224 in cooperation with the pin 210 retains the plunger 211 downwardly to prevent reengagement of the escapement mechanism with the traveling carriage. When the traveling carriage returns from rebounding, the stop 120 contacts the upper end of the bar 232 to disengage the notch 235 from the stud 233. The spring 226 then returns the lever 224 counter-clockwise and the bar 232 downwardly out of This movement of the bar 211 the path of the stop I20. This counter-clockwise movement of the lever 224 allows the escapement control plunger 2 I I to be returned upwardly by resilient means (not shown) to reengage the escapement pawl 419 (Fig. 19A) with the ratchet 460 to retain the traveling carriage in its tabulated position. 
 As a safety precaution to prevent damage in case the traveling carriage is accidentally returned toward the left after the tabulating stop bars 2I1 and 232 have been moved upwardly into the path of the tabulating stops I20, the upper ends of said bars have angular surfaces over which the stops I20 ride forcing the bar 2I1 downwardly flexing the spring 222 and likewise forcing the bar 232 downwardly rocking the plate 231 counter-clockwise against the tension of the spring 240. 
 Calling attention to Figs. 3, 8 and 19, the lever 224 has an angular projection 24I cooperating with the upper hooked end of a latch 242 pivoted on a racket 243 secured to the tabulatnig frame 206. The latch 242 carries a stud 244 embraced by the bifurcated end of an upward extension of a link 245 slotted on its forward end to receive a stud 246 in a lever 241 pivoted on a stud 248 in the frame 3|. The lever 241 is slotted to receive a stud 249 in a stem 250 of a skip tabulating bar 25I the upper end of which is loosely supported in an aperture in the keyboard plate 18. The bar 25I overlies an extension 252 of the starting bar 64 with the obvious result that depression thereof also depresses the starting bar 64 to release the machine for operation. A spring 253 is tensioned to return and retain the bar 25I in home position at the end of machine operation. A spring 254 forms a resilient connection between the bar 25I and the lever 241 so that these members may be moved independently of each other when required. 
 The rearward end of the link 245 is pivoted to the lower end of a lever 255 loose on a stud 256 secured in the totalizer frame. Pivoted on the upper end of the lever 255 is a lever 251 a forward extension of which has steps 258 and 259 resiliently urged into communication with a stud 260 in the frame 3| by a spring 26I stretched between said stud 260 and an ear of the lever 251. An upward extension of the lever 251 is pivoted to a right angled projection of a plate 263 slidably supported by a stud 264 secured in the carriage ball race 35. Relative movement between the levers 255 and 251 is governed by means of a projection 265 of the lever 251 and a stud 266 secured in said lever cooperating with the upper end of the lever 255. The plate 263 carries a roller 261 which cooperates with the camming surfaces of skip tabulating blocks 268 and 269 (see also Figs. 17 and 18) secured on an angular bar 210 fast to the frame of the traveling carriage 34. The bar 210 has a series of holes which in cooperation with screws threaded in the blocks 268 and 269 provide an easy means of locating said blocks in various columnar positions. 
 Depressing the skip tabulating bar 25I (Figs. 3 and 8) by means of the spring 254 rocks the lever 241 counter-clockwise as observed in Fig. 3, which by-means of the link 245 rocks the latch 242 also counter-clockwise to hook said latch over the projection 24I of the lever 224 (see also Fig. 19). This forward movement of the link 245 rocks the lever 255 clockwise to move the lever 251 and the plate 263 rearwardly until the step 258 passes beyond the lower edge of the stud 260. The spring 26I then rocks the lever 251 clockwise so that the step 258 is opposite the rearwardly disposed surface of the stud 260. An extension 21l of the lever 251 in cooperation with the lower surface of the stud 260 limits the clockwise movement of said lever 251. Depressing the skip tabulating bar 25! by means of the extension 252 also depresses the starting bar 64. This as previously explained allows the hook I31 to latch over the pin I34 and carry the lever I35 downwardly which by means of the lever 205 (Figs. 19 and 20) rocks the lever 20'! clockwise against the tension of the spring 2I3 so that the latch 2I9 hooks over the stud 22I. The latch 242 restrains the lever 224 and the bar 232 against upward movement, consequently the opening 233 in said bar 232 in cooperation with the stud 223 likewise restrains upward movement of the bar 2 I 1. Therefore the lever 201 moves independent- 1y of the bar 2I1 the stud 2I5 moving idly in the slot 2I5. 
 It will be recalled that clockwise movement of the lever 201 moves the escapement control plunger 2II downwardly to disengage the escapement mechanism from the traveling carriage. Consequently the traveling carriage is now free to tabulate without interruption as the bars 2I1 and 232 are retained out of the path of the stops I20. 
 It will be remembered that there are two types of camming blocks used in connection with the skip-tabulating mechanism. One of these blocks 268 (Figs. 15 and 18) functions when the skiptabulating bar 25I (Fig. 3) is depressed, and the weight of the hand immediately removed therefrom. Retaining the skip tabulating bar depressed prevents the camming block 258 from functioning but has no influence on the action of the camming block 269 (Fig. 1'7). During tabulation of the traveling carriage the stop 260 engages the roller 261 to rock the lever 251 counter-clockwise thereby disengaging the step 255 from the rearwardly disposed surface of the stud 260. The spring 26I then rocks the lever 255 counter-clockwise until the step 259 of the lever 251 again engages the stud 260. This counterclockwise movement of the lever 255 returns the link 245 rearwardly to rock the latch 242 clockwise out of engagement with the projection 24I of the lever 224 (see also Fig. 19). This frees the lever 224 and the stop bars 2I1 and 232 to i the action of the spring 222 which forces them upwardly into the path of one of the stops I20 carried by the traveling carriage which in cooperation with said stop bars positions the traveling carriage in the manner explained earlier herein. 
 When the bar 25I (Fig. 3) is retained depressed the lever 251 is rocked counter-clockwise by the camming block 268 without imparting any movement to the lever 255 and link 245. This is due to the fact that the tension of the spring 261 is insufficient to overcome the spring 254. Therefore the traveling carriage continues to tabulate until one of the camming blocks 2653 (Figs. 15 and 17) with maximum throw engages the roller 261 (Fig. 3). The cam 269 imparts greater counter-clockwise movement to the lever 251 than the cam 268 thereby causing the stud 260 to engage the lever 255 to impart counter-clocln wise movement thereto. This moves the link 245 rearwardly to disengage the latch 242 as explained above to allow the stop bars 2!! and 232 to move upwardly into the path of the proper stop I20. Rearward movement of the link 245 imparts clockwise movement to the lever 241, 
which is free to move independently of the stem 258 of the bar 25I due to the slot therein cooperating with the stud 249. 
 Fig. 3 depicts the parts of the skip tabulating mechanism in the positions they invariably occupy when the machine is at rest and to which positions they are restored soon after printing is complete. As the traveling carriage may be returned from tabulated positions only after printing is complete, Fig. 3 likewise depicts the positions of the skip tabulating parts during carriage return. Therefore the roller 261 is out of the path of the camming surface of the block 268. However, the camming block 289 engages the roller 261 and rocks the lever 251 a slight distance counter-clockwise. This counter-clockwise movement of the lever 251 however is not sufficient to disengage the step 259 from the stud 268 and after the camming block moves beyond the roller the spring 26I returns the lever 251 to the position here shown. 
 From the foregoing description it will be seen that in addition to the usual step by step tabulating from one column to the next, that by using the skip tabulating mechanism just described in conjunction with the stop 298 it is possible to skip tabulate the traveling carriage through several columnar positions to a certain columnar position determined by the position of said camming block 268. It will also be seen that the use of the skip tabulating mechanism in conjunction with the stop 269 makes it possible to skip-tabulate the traveling carriage through the regular columnar positions and also through the columnar positions determined by the oamming block 268 to a particular columnar position determined by the position of the camming block 289. 
Balance My locking mechanism In the machine of the instant invention mechanism has been devised to enforce the printing of the balance in a certain column of the record sheet. Th s mechanism is normally effective to lock the balance key against depression and is rendered ineffective only when the traveling carriage is tabulated to certain columnar positions. 
 Directing attention to Figs. 8 and 9 when the traveling carriage is tabulated to certain columnar positions a downward projection 211 of the stop I28 engages an upturned extension 212 of a hanging bar lever 213 to rock said lever clockwise as here observed on its pivot 214 of the tabulating frame 286. Clockwise movement of the lever 213 lifts a hanging bar 215 which by means of a stud 218 therein in cooperation with a slot in a plate 288 rocks said plate clockwise on its pivot stud 28I secured in the left frame 38. The rearward end of a pitman 282 is pivoted to the plate 288 while the forward end thereof is slotted to embrace a stud 283 in the frame 38. Consequently clockwise movement of the plate 288 moves the pitman 282 rearwardly to disengage a right-angled projection 284 thereof from a notch 285 in the balance key II8. This unlocks the balance key II8 so that it may be depressed to print the balance in the proper column of the record material. When the traveling carriage is moved from this particular po-- sition and the stop I28 no longer engages the lever 213, a spring 286 returns the associated parts to normal position as here shown so that the projection 284 of the pitman 282 will reengage the notch 285 in the balanc key I I8, 
Machine release by balance key Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, depressing the balance key I I8 moves the notch 285 therein opposite an extension 281 of a latch 288 loose on a. stud 289 secured in the frame 38. This allows a spring 298 to rock said latch 288 clockwise which by means of a stud 29I in an extension 292 of said latch in cooperation with an extension of an arm. 293 secured on a shaft 294 journaled in the frames 38 and 3I rocks said shaft 294 counter-clockwise as here observed. Secured on the right end of the shaft 294 is an arm 295 bifurcated to receive a stud 296 in the plate 61. It is therefore obvious that counter-clockwise movement of the shaft 294 by means of the arm 295 rocks the plate 61 clockwise as observed in Fig. 8, and counter-clockwise as observed in Figs. 3 and '7 to release the machine for operation in the usual manner. 
 It is generally the practice to allow the extension 281 of the latch 288 to bear directly upon the edge of the key stems but in this instance the strength of the spring 298 is sufficient to overcome the action of the compression spring which returns the key I I 8 upwardly upon release thereof. If under the above condition the balance key I I8 were partially depressed it would be retained in that position thereby causing an. undesired effect and a possible jamming of mechanism upon operation of the machine. It was also found that accidentally or carelessly retaining the balance key depressed at the end of machine operation prevented the proper functioning of the regular non-repeat mechanism and resulted in the jamming of the machine mechanism. Therefore in order to overcome these undesirable conditions means were provided to prevent the extension 281 of the latch 288 bearing on the edge of the key stem and to make the restoring of the latch 288 at the end of machine operations independent of the release of the balance key II8. This latter being in effect an auxiliary non-repeat mechanism for the machine. 
 Describing in detail the mechanism outlined above the spring 298 (Figs. 8 and 9) normally maintains the extension 281 of the latch 288 against a vertical surface 291 of a latch pawl 298 pivoted at 299 to the left frame 38 and urged clockwise by a spring 388 against a stop stud 38I secured in the frame 38. The pawl 298 has a notch 382 which cooperates with a bent-over ear 383 of a plate 384 urged clockwise by a spring 385 and rotatably supported by a bracket 388 secured on the stem of the balance key H8. 
 Depression of the balance key IIB causes the ear 383 of the plate 384 to engage the lower surface of the notch 382 to rock the latch pawl 298 counter-clockwise to disengage the surface 291 thereof from the extension 281 of the latch 288. This allows the extension 281 to enter the notch 285 in the stern of the key H8 and in so doing said extension engages and rocks the plate 384 counter-clockwise to disengage the ear 383 from the notch 382 in the pawl 298. This frees the pawl 298 to the action of the spring 388 and when the latch 288 is restored counter-clockwise near the end of machine operation the pawl 298 snaps into position to hold the extension 281 out of contact with the stem of the key H8 and to prevent clockwise releasing movement of the latch 288 in case the balance key H8 is retained depressed after operation is complete. It is therefore evident that the device just described prevents excessive drag on the stem of the balance key H8 and also serves as a non-repeat mechanism in case the balance key is inadvertently retained depressed. 
Traveling carriage return mechanism The instant machine is equipped with three carriage return bars, depression of which actuates mechanism that causes the traveling carriage to be returned to different columnar positions. In addition, one of the bars is adapted to release the machine for operation to cause the platen roll to be line-spaced during the return of the traveling carriage. The carriage return mechanism will now be described. 
 Referring to Figs. 10, 11, 12 and 13, pivoted respectively on studs 301, 308 and 309 secured in the machine case 33 are carriage return bars 3|0, 3| I and 3|2 to which are pivoted respectively the forward ends of pitmans 3|3, 3|4 and 315. The rear ends of the pitmans 3|3, 3|4 and 3|5 are bifurcated to embrace a stud 3|6 in a plate 3|"! secured to the case 33. The pitmans 3|3, 3 l4 and 3 l5 have respectively camming apertures 3|B, 3| 9 and 326, which cooperate with a stud 32| in a lever 322 pivoted on the stud 3|6. The lever 322 carries a stud 323 upon which is pivoted an arm 324 flexibly connected to said lever by means of a spring 325. The arm 324 has projections 326 and 330 which cooperate respectively with stops 33| and 332 (Figs. 10 and 14) mounted on a bar 333 secured by a plurality of studs 334 to brackets 335 and 335 fast to the traveling carriage frame. Screws threaded in the stops 33| and 332 in cooperation with a plurality of holes in the bar 333 provide a convenient means of locating said stops 33| and 332 in the desired columnar positions. Pivoted on the plate 3|| is an arm 331 with a stud 338 urged by a spring 339 into communication with a series of notches 340 in the lever 322, said notches corresponding to the three positions of said lever 322. 
 Referring to Fig. 10, slidably supported in a vertical slot in the plate 3|! is a stud 34| carrying a roller 342, which cooperates with camming surfaces on the upper edges of the pitmans 3|3, 3|4 and 3|5 in a manner presently to be described. The stud 34| is secured in a link 343 the upper end of which is loosely connected to a lever 344 pivoted at 345 to the machine case 33. The rearwardly disposed end of the lever 344 (Fig. 16) cooperates with a lever 346 fulcrumed on a stud 341 in the machine case. The lever 346 is connected by closely wound springs 348 to a lever 349 pivoted to a carriage return gear frame 350. The rounded end of the lever 349 extends within an annular groove in the hub of a carriage return gear 35| loose on a vertical shaft 352 journaled in the frame 35|] and operatively connected to the machine motor. The return gear 35| has a plurality of clutch teeth arranged to cooperate with similar teeth in a return gear driving disk 311 secured on the shaft 352. The gear 35| meshes with a return rack 353 slidably mounted by means of a plurality of symmetrical slots 354 in cooperation with the studs 334. The 
r carriage return bars 3H), 3H and 3|2 are yieldingly retained in normal positions by springs 355, 356 and 351. 
 Depressing the carriage return bar 350 (Figs. 10 and 11) moves the pitman 3 l3 forwardly causing the aperture 3|8 therein in cooperation with the stud 32| to position the lever 322 and the arm 324 as here shown in which position the projections 326 and 330 of said arm are out of the path of the stops 33| and 332. Simultaneously the camming surface on the pitman 3L3 in cooperation with the roller 342 moves the link 343 upwardly to rock the lever 344 counter-clockwise which in turn rocks the lever 346 (Fig. 16) clockwise. Clockwise movement of the lever 346 by means of the spring 348 shifts the lever 349 counter-clockwise to raise the return gear 35| so that its clutch teeth are moved into communication with the teeth of the driving disk 311. A spring-pulled retaining pawl 358 cooperating with a downward projection of the lever 349 retains said lever and the return gear 35| in either of their positions. The member 311 revolves the return gear 35| in the direction indicated by the arrow to return the traveling carriage toward the left, as viewed from the rear of the machine in Fig. 16. When the traveling carriage arrives at starting position a. left marginal stop blocks further return movement thereof. However the rack 353 continues to move independently of the carriage flexing a spring 359. Guided by the slots 354 in cooperation with the studs 334, the rack 353 receives a downward movement near the terminus of its independent movement, which in cooperation with a flange 360 of the return gear 35| forces said gear downwardly out of engagement with the driving disk 3'". The spring 359 then returns the rack 353 to its normal position. The regular carriage escapement mechanism retains the carriage in -its returned position after the return gear is disengaged from its driving disk. 
 The shock of the return of the rack 333 is absorbed by a spring-pushed plunger 36| (Fig. 4) loosely supported in the bent-over ears of a bracket 362 secured to the traveling carriage frame, said plunger 36| being engaged by a stud 363 in the rack 353. The plunger 36| also acts as a stop to locate the carriage return rack 353 in its normal position. 
 Referring to Figs. 10 and 12 depressing the carriage return bar 3|| moves the pitman 3|4 forwardly causing the camming aperture 3l9 therein, in cooperation with the stud 32| to rock the lever 322 and the arm 324 to the position indicated by dot and dash lines in Fig. 12. In this position the projection 330 of said arm is in the path of the stop 332. Simultaneously the camming surface of the rearward end of the pitman 3|4 in cooperation with the roller 342 shifts the carriage return gear 35| (Fig. 16) upwardly into engagement with its driving disk 3'", as explained above. This causes the traveling carriage to be returned toward the left until the stop 332 contacts the projection 330 to stop the traveling carriage in a predetermined columnar position. The carriage return rack continues its movement relatively to the traveling carriage to disengage the carriage return gear 35| from the disk 353 in the manner described above. 
 Directing attention to Figs. 10, 13 and 16 depressing the carriage return bar 3|2 moves the pitman 3|5 rearwardly causing the camming aperture 320 therein, in cooperation with the stud 32| to rock the lever 322 and the arm 324 to the position indicated by dot and dash lines in Fig. 13. In this position the forward projection 326 of said arm 324 is in the path of the stop 33|. Rearward movement of the pitman 3|5 causes the camming surface thereon to shift the roller 342 and associated mechanism to move the carriage return gear 35| upwardly into engagement with its driving disk 3". This causes the traveling carriage to be returned in the manner explained above until the stop 33| engages the projection 326 of the arm 324. The rack 353 then disengages the carriage return gear 35l from the disk 311 in the manner explained above to position the traveling carriage in a predetermined columnar position. 
 When the traveling carriage is being tabulated from left to right as viewed from the rear of the machine, angular surfaces 321 and 328, (Fig. 14) on the stops 33I and 332 cooperate respectively with the projections 326 and 336 of the arm 324 (Fig. 13) to move said arm clockwise to its ineffective position. The plate 58 (Fig. 10) in cooperation with an ear 318 of the lever 322 returns said lever and the arm 324 clockwise to ineffective position during the initial part of each machine operation. 
 It will be recalled that the stud 338 in the arm 331 in cooperation with the notches 348 in the lever 322 retains said lever and the arm 324 in their various positions. 
 In addition to returning the traveling carriage, depressing the bar 3l2 (Figs. '7, 10 and 13) also releases the machine for an idle operation by depressing the vertical feed bar I86, the sole purpose of said operation being to line space the platen. Depressing the bar 3l2 also unlocks the normally locked machine releasing mechanism simultaneously with the depression of the vertical feed bar. A link 394 connects a downward extension of the bar 3l2 to a pawl 395 loose on a stud 396 in the frame 3|. A nose of the pawl 395 cooperates with a projection391 of the stem of the bar I86. Another extension of the bar 3l2 has a stud 468 coacting with a, V shaped surface on an arm 46I secured on a release control shaft 462 journaled in the frames 30 and 3|. The upper end of the arm 46I is bifurcated to embrace a stud 463 in an extension of a locking plate 464 pivoted at 465 to the frame 38 and a downward portion of which has a step 466 cooperating with a square stud 461 in the release plate 61. 
 The shaft 462, the arm 46I, and the plate 464 are normally under the control of the control keys H8 and H9 (Fig. 2) and the hanging bar levers, the latter being actuated by the traveling carriage in columnar positions thereof. Depression of one of the control keys or tabulation of the carriage to certain columnar positions rocks the shaft 462 and arm 46I counter-clockwise (Fig. 7) and the plate 464 clockwise to move the step 466 out of the path of the stud 461 to permit counter-clockwise releasing movement of the plate 61. Likewise depression of the return bar 3| 2 by means of the stud 468 cooperating with the arm 46I rocks the plate 464 to ineffective position. Depression of the bar 3l2 by means of the link 394 rocks the pawl 395 counter-clockwise causing the nose thereof in cooperation with the projection 391 to depress the vertical feed bar I86 to cause an idle machine operation to line space the platen. 
Platen feed disabling mechanism The instant machine is equipped with mechanism to feed the platen roll upon return of the traveling carriage either to starting position or any of its intermediate positions. This mechanism is so arranged that independent movement of the carriage return rack 353 (Fig. 16) after the traveling carriage has been returned to the proper column moves the platen feed bail I62 (Fig. '1) downwardly to feed the platen. This mechanism is well shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, and will now be described in detail. 
 The right hand vertical extension of the carriage return rack 353 has a camming projection 369 when they are coupled together. 
364 which cooperates with a roller 365 on an eccentric stud 366 secured to an arm 361 pivoted on a stud 368 in the bracket 362 secured to the traveling carriage frame. Turnably mounted on the stud 368 is an arm 369 with a bushing 318 loosely supporting a spring plunger 31I having secured to the upper end thereof (Fig. 6) a knob The bushing 310 and knob 312 have notched. 
312. cuts and tenons which when meshed allow the downward end of the plunger 31l to enter an aperture in the arm 361 to connect said arm 36! and the arm 369 for unitary movement. Lifting the knob 312 as viewed in Fig. 6 disengages the plunger 31I from the arm 361 and turning said knob degrees in either direction so that the tenons are opposed retains said plunger disengaged from said arm. 361. A right-angled extension 313 of the arm 369 has an upturned lip which cooperates with a stud 314 secured at the right end of the feed bail I62 in the curled lower edge thereof. 
 As previously explained when the traveling carriage is stopped in its return movement by any one of the various stops, the carriage return rack 353 continues to move toward the left (as viewed in Fig. 4) independently of the traveling carriage to disengage the carriage return mechanism. This movement of the rack 353 causes the camming extension 364 thereof in cooperation with the roller 365 to rock the arm 361 counter-clockwise or downwardly. If the plunger 31I engages the aperture in the arm 361, the arm 369 will be moved in unison therewith and by means of the extension 313 in cooperation with the stud 314 (Fig. 4) will rock the platen feed bail I62 downwardly to feed the platen roll in the manner previously explained. Obviously disengaging the plunger 31l (Fig. 5) from the arm 361 disables the automatic feed of the platen roll upon return of the traveling carriage. It will be recalled that the bail I62 (Fig. 4) after its feeding movement is completed is spring-returned upwardly to normal position. This also returns the arms 361 and When the arms uncoupled the arms 361 is returned upwardly by a spring 315 (Fig. 5) tensioned between said arms. 
 A full stroke device is provided to insure that the arms 361 and 369 and the bail I62 complete their feeding movements. Secured on a stud 316 in the bracket 362 (Figs. 4 and 6) is a full stroke pawl 38!) with teeth 38I adapted to cooperate with a beveled upper edge 382 of the extension 313 of the arm 359. The pawl 388 has a right angled projection 383 which cooperates with a stud 384 in the camming extension 354 of the carriage return rack 353. A spring 385 urges the pawl 388 counterclockwise which movement is blocked by the stud 384 when the rack 353 is in normal position. However when the rack 353 moves toward the left independent of the traveling carriage to feed the platen roll the stud 384 moves away from the extension 383 of the full stroke pawl 386 allowing the spring 385 to engage the ratchet teeth 38I of said pawl with the beveled edge 382 of the extension 313. While the arm 369 is moving downwardly to operate the bail I62 the edge 382 ratchets over the teeth in the pawl 380 to prevent the arm and hail backing up before their full stroke has been completed. The pawl 38!) retains the arm 369 and bail I62 in fed position until return movement of the rack 353 causes the stud 384 to engage the extension 383 to rock the pawl 388 clockwise out of engagement with the beveled
