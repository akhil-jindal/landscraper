15 Claims. 
 This invention relates to improvements in card punching machines and has more particular relation to improvements in punching machines which are capable of being controlled by another machine located at a distant point. 
 The main object of the present invention is to provide a punching machine which is capable of being controlled by a structurally separate and distantly located machine, such as a cash register, with provision 0!. means whereby the correctness of the punching on the card can be verifled by its comparison with the entry made in the cash register. 
 Cash registers are now equipped with one or more totalizers to secure a segregated analysis of the various classification of items entered therein. Such types of machines are relatively expensive and to avoid such complicated machines it has been the object of many inventions to construct such machines with card punching attachments whereby with the aid of existing card sorting and tabulating machines an analysis of the sales may be made in greater detail. Such punching mechanisms were usually incorporated in the cash register and it is an object of the present invention to construct the cash register so that its entry may be reflected by a card punched in a punching machine located at a distant point, usually in the bookkeeping or auditing department of the place of business. In this manner, the analysis may take place without any interruption to the operator of the cash register necessitated by frequent withdrawals of the punched cards for purposes of sales analysis. 
 With this object of theinvention attained it is possible to locate the cash register at the place of business and by electrical connections to the punching machine control card punching operations from the cash register. The punching operations ensue automatically after its initiation by the operator of the cash register by the provision of a special key. 
 Obviously, the efliciency of the system is determined mainly by the accuracy of the punching operation and any discrepancy between the total amount accumulated in the cash register and by the card tabulating machine will usually signify an error in the punching operation. Such errors are only discernible by visual inspection of both machines and is usually only found, due to this reason, when a complete series of entries and card pu'nching operations have been made. 
 It is, therefore, the object of the present invention to determine the accuracy'of the punching operation by a comparison of the value of each card punched with the amount or value set up on a cash register immediately after punching each card. This direct comparison is instituted after each card punching operation and by suitable signalling devices the operators of both the punching machine and cash register are informed when there is an error. 
 It is more specifically an object of the present invention to provide a series of mechanisms in the cash register which are diflerentially set to represent the value entered. These mechanisms are then read out to control the punching machine to cause a card to be punched to represent this value. 
 The card is then analyzed to difierentially set up a series of mechanisms in the punching machine to represent the value on the punched card. 
The series of mechanisms of the cash register is then returned to normal under control of the series of mechanisms in the punching machine, and thereafter the series of mechanisms of the punching machine is returned to normal under its own control. Suitable testing devices then act automatically to determine if both series of mechanisms are at normal. Obviously, if the value set up on the cash register is -734- and the card is punched --'734-- both series of mechanisms will return to normal. If the card is incorrectly punched to represent 733- the units mechanism of the cash register will be ofl. normal and the error will be located. J 
 It is a further object of the present invention to cause said testing devices to selectively assort the cards as to whether they are correctly or incorrectly punched and to provide suitable locking devices to lock the cash register when card punching operations are initiated and to unlock it if the card is correstly punched. 
 The series of mechanisms referred to comprise well known electrical read-out devices controlled by emitters.- The cash register sets up brush structures of its read-out device and by a controlling emitter electrical impulses are transmitted by wires of a cable to punching control magnets at diflerential times to thereby punch by a set of punches holes in the columns of an intermittently moving card. 
 The holes of the card are then analyzed to transmit electrical impulses to magnets which to diflerentially set up the brush structures of a read-out device of the punching machine. By means of an emitter impulses are directed at differential but complementary times to control magnets which cause the brush structures of the II cash register read-out device to return to normal, if the card is punched correctly. The pivoted brush structures comprise flexible inclined wires and, obviously, they can only be moved unidirectionally and for this reason both read-out devices are returned to normal by complementary rotation of their brushes. If a brush structure was at the 7 position only three units of complementary movement are necessary ,to return it to 0". The brush structures of the punching read-out device are returned to normal under their own control and another emitter by causing complementary timed impulses to be directed to control magnets which cause the return of brush structures of the read-out device of the punching machine to 0. A circuit is then closed at one point to determine its continuity by the position of the brush structures of both readout devices. If one fails to return to 0" the circult is ,opened, a distinctive signal is lighted, the card is rejected and the cash register fails to unlock. 
 The provision of electrical control instrumentalities in both machines lends itself admirably for distant control and this object is attained by a novel electrical solution. 
 The various operations instituted in the punching machine proceed automatically without attention of either operator. All incorrect operations are immediately discernible, such as, failure to reset both read-out devices, whether due to incorrect card punching, mechanical or electrical failure, the failure of a card to feed in the punching machine, etc. 
 It is a further object of the nivention to provide for punching of repetition data on each of a series of cards. punching machine to punch each card to represent, for example, the clerk operating the machine. In a similar manner, there is a control in the punching machine to represent the machine number, for example. 
 The invention is shown by way of example applied to a well known form of cash register which is equipped with a value indicating mechanism. If a card is incorrectly punched the indicating mechanism will indicate the value that should have been punched since it is not restored to normal until at the beginning of the next cash register operation. 
 Instead of the cash register any other form of entry device may be used, such as, an adding machine, calculating typewriter, etc., and the invention is not to be limited by the combination herein disclosed. 
 The invention is illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings in which:

 The cash register shown in connection with the present improvements is for illustrative purposes only as any other iorm of item entry accounting device may be employed. The type of machine shown is well known and a complete description thereof may be found in numerous patents, particularly the patent issued to J. P. Cleal and F. A. Reinhard, No. 580,378, dated April 13, 189 
 As shown in the patent referred to the ma-, chine is provided with a series of banks of keys, of which only one bank is shown in Fig. 1. These keys are indicated by reference numeral I0 and are depressed against the tension of their springs H to determine the differential movement of operating segments i 2. The operation of any of these keys ill in a bank elevates its detent l3. The segments i2 are all journaled loosely on a main shaft l4 and are provided with slidable looking or latching plates I 5. The segments l2 carry pivoted pawls it which are adapted to engage and be stopped by the inner end of any depressed key it. 
 When the pawl 95 abuts a depressed key the plate i5 is moved to the left and into one of a series of notches W of a plate 08 thereby locking the segment ii! in adjusted position. 
 The main shaft M is arranged to be oscillated at each operation by a crank arm 89 connected through a link 26 to a second crank arm 2! rigidly mounted on an operating shaft 2'2 of the machine. Rigid on shaft it is a series of segments 23 one for each segment it which together with depending projections 24 serve to move the segments 12 in opposite directions in a well known manner. It will be understood that although this mechanism is shown in connection with only one bank of keys there will be a segment l2 and a cooperating mechanism for each bank. The segments l2 each carry a rack 28 which in the case of the amount keys of the banks is adapted to control the setting of an indicator wheel 21 and a totalizer element 28. 
 The operating handle 29 (Fig. 4) of the cash register is provided with a pinion 30 which meshes with a gear 3| which in turn meshes with a gear 32. The gear 32 is secured to one end of a transverse shaft 33 and meshes with a gear 34 secured to the transverse shaft 22. 
 Upon the rotation of shaft 22 by the crank handle 29 by the gear drive just described all of the segments I2 which have previously been difierentiallypositioned will be first rocked counterclockwise by the projections 24. Upon the return or clockwise movement of the segments 23 shoulders 35 formed on the segments 23 will be engaged by the slides I of the banks in which keys have been depressed, so that the actuators i2 carrying the latches or pawls of the banks in which keys are depressed will also be carried rearwardly distances determined by the values of the key depressed. 
 The actuators l2 are returned to their normal positions at the beginning of each operation of the machine by the extensions 2 1 which engage with the actuators l2 and thereby carry them to their normal positions. 
 The operation of the type of cash register shown is briefly explained herein as it is so well known by those skilled in the art. 
 It will be understood that after a rack 26 has been returned to normal from its previous differential adjustment it is then turned clockwise a clifierential amount to set up value corresponding to the key depressed. This clockwise movement of rack 28 is utilized to set up an item wheel to represent the value entered and a plurality of such units are provided to take care of a plurality of denominational orders, although a description of only one order is herein given. 
 Continuously in mesh with the segment rack a gear 36 (Fig. 1) meshing with a gear 3'5 loose on a rod 38. Attached to the gear 3? is a gear 39 (Fig. 1a) and adjacent the gear 3Q is a gear 40. The gear It is sleeved to a gear ll loy a sleeve 42 loosely surrounding the shaft 38. The gear 4! meshes with a gear 43 attached to an index wheel 44. In alignment with the adjacent gears 39 and 46 is 'a broad pinion 45, that is; itis of suflicient width to engage with both gears 39 and when shifted to a position to engage with both gears 39 and 39. This engagement is provided to communicate the clockwise movement of gear 39 to the gear 40 and thus to the index wheel 44 to thereby set up on said wheel 44 a value corresponding to the key depressed. The means for accomplishing this function will now be described. 
 The gears 45, of which there are several, are carried on a rod 46 supported by arms 41 attached to a shaft 48. Secured to the shaft 43 is an arm 49 having a link connection 50 to a bell crank 5| to which is connected a pitman 52. A cam 53 fast on the shaft 22 cooperates with a roller 54 on the side of the pitman 52 to throw the pinions 45 into mesh with the pairs of gears 39, 40 so that the counterclockwise diiferential movement of gears 36 will be communicated to the various item wheels 44. After the segments 26 have been given their differential movements the cam 53 will withdraw the broad pinions 45 out of mesh with the pairs of gears 39, 49 and they will remain so disengaged during the counterclockwise or restoring movements of the segment racks 26 at the next operation of the machine. 
 The above described mechanism is essentially the same as that shown in connection with the engaging mechanism for the totalizer utilized in the machine disclosed in the aforesaid Clea] and Reinhard Patent No. 580,378. 
 In mesh with the gear 43 is a gear 55 (Fig. 1) which is in mesh with a gear 56 to which is secured a brush structure 57 so that the brush structure 51 is angularly displaced according to the setting of the item wheel 44. The brush structure carries two brushes, one of which engages with one of a series of segments 58 and h lized to control the punching of a card to represent the value of the keys depressed and which mechanism will now be described with particular reference to Figs. 5 and 6. 
 It should be noted that the register is intended to be used at the place where sales in a busimass are made while the punching device is lo cated at a distant place, preferably in the bookkeeping or auditing department so that as the various sales are made a card is punched at a distantly located place to give unchangeable records of the sales made. Hence, it will be observed that the punching machine disclosed in Figs. 5 and 6 is structurally separate from the cash register or other item entry controlling device and distantly located, although they are electrically interconnected for control operation to be described. 
 Figs. 7c and To when adjacent in the order they are just mentioned disclose the preferable form of electrical wiring'diagram. When an amount is to be punched on the card the operator depresses a start key ST mounted on the cash register but only disclosed in the wiring diagram in Fig. To. This completes a circuit, described from the negative line side til, through contacts ST, a wire magnet to the positive line side 65, thus energizing magnet t3 which causes a series of contacts 53a, 63b, 53c, and 63d to close. 
 The circuit for the motor M of the punching device is now completed since its circuit is from the positive line side 5i, through motor M, contacts 53b, to the negative line side. The circuit for the motor N (Fig. 3) of the cash register is also closed as it leads from the positive line side ti, through motor N, contacts 632) to the negative line side 59. Motors M and N now operate. 
 A stick circuit for magnet $3 to retain its series of contacts 53o, 33c, etc closed is provided by a line wire leading from closed contacts 53a to contacts CC-2 now closed, to the negative line side to, and another stick circuit leads from contacts 63a, wire 65, and relay contacts 660 closed when magnet 66 is energized, and thence to the negative line side 60. The circuit for the energization of magnet 66 will be described later. 
 The blank cards to be punched have been placed in a magazine 61 (Fig. 5) of the punching machine so that the lowermost card rocks a pivhi it will be evident that this will close the circuit. 
of the magnet 69, thereby causing the energization of the same, and the closure of contacts 69a. 
 A circuit fora card feed clutch magnet I0 is closed when cam contacts CC-I close and which is described as follows: from the positive line side 6|, (Fig. 7a) magnet '10, contacts 630 now closed, contacts 69a now closed since there is a card in the magazine 61, contacts 661) closed normally by a spring attached to one contact blade, the circuit being closedxto the negative line side 60 when contacts CCI are closed by an operating cam. 
 From Fig. 6 it will be evident that motor M drives a pulley I2 to which pulley there is secured a pinion 93 driving a gear I3 to which there is secured a pinion I4 meshing with a gear I5 which is loosely mounted on a shaft I6 but attached to which is another driving gear 11. 
 Attached to gears I5 and Ti is a notched disk 18 loose on shaft I6. Adjacent the disk "I8 is an arm I9 secured to shaft I6 and carrying a clutch pawl 80 pivoted thereon. The pawl has an extension adapted to fit in the notch of the disk 18 and is urged to engage the disk by a spring 8|. 
 However, the pawl is held disengaged by an armature latch 02 which engages an extending arm on the pawl. When the card feed clutch magnet is energized the associated armature is attracted and latch 82 is rocked to the left about pivot 83, releasing pawl and connecting shaft 76 to the driving gears. 
 The gear 'I'I which it will be observed is continually rotating is in mesh with a gear 84 which is in mesh with a gear 85 secured to a shaft 86. The shaft 06 carries a series of cams adapted to close contacts designated herein as the CC contacts one of such for instance, being the contacts CCI. Therefore, these are closed at a .certain point in the cycle to cause energization of the card feed clutch magnet I0. 
 When shaft i6 is operated a pair of complementary earns 07, 80 (Fig. 9) fast thereto are operated. A two-armed lever 89 secured to a shaft 90 carries a pair of rollers cooperating with the cams 81, 86, so as to rock the shaft 90. Attached to the shaft 90 are sector arms M (Fig. 5) provided with gear teeth that mesh with racks on the picker slides 92. A knife 93 attached to the slides is adapted to engage the bottom card in hopper 61 and move the card to the left (Fig. 5) when the picker slides 92 are reciprocated by the earns 87, 88 on the shaft 16. 
 The gear which drives the gear I3 (Fig. 6) and which is attached to the pulley I2 is designated by numeral 93 and the same is attached -to a shaft 94 and rotates continually. 
 A roller 95 (Fig. 9) on a stud extending from the gear 93 forms a means for driving a Geneva step motion gear 96 with an intermittent movement. The Geneva gear 96 is attached to a shaft 91 but is locked in each position by the cooperation of a concentric formation 98 at the. end of each radial extension with a hub 99' on shaft 94. The roller 95 moves idly for the greater part of the are about shaft 94 until it engages in one of the slots I00 in gear 96. The gear is moved with a gradually accelerated and then gradually retarded motion which is stopped as the roller 95 slips out of a slot I00. The gear 96 is released for each step of movement by a depression IOI in the side of hub 99. The depression IOI is presented only when the roller 95 is in position to drive the gear '96. 
 Attached to the shaft 91 is a gear I02 which meshes with a gear I03 and a gear I04. The gear I04 is attached to a shaft I05 to which is secured a pinion I06 (Fig. 6) in mesh with a pinion I01 attached to a shaft I08. As shown in Fig. 5 a pair of rollers I09 is secured to the shafts I05 and I08 and thereby the card is fed between the rollers I09 and to a series of punches H0 in a step-by-step motion. To feed the card as it passes the series of punches there is provided a pair of rollers III (Fig. 5) attached to shafts H2. Shafts II2 are intergeared by pinions II3 (Fig. 6) and the uppermost gear H3 is rotatable with the gear I03. 
 Therefore, the card is fed by the pairs of rollers I09, and III in a step-by-step movement past the line of punches H0, of which there is one for each column of the card. 
 Referring to Fig. 5 and the wiring diagram when the card emerges from the hopper 61 it operates to close the die card lever contacts DCL (Fig. 7a at the right of a horizontal central line) thereby extending the negative line side 60 to a commutator ring II5 of an emitter shown in Fig. 7a and designated Emitter No. 1. It is well known that cam contacts may be timed by a cam to close at the end of one cycle and continue the closure for the first part of the next cycle as illustrated for CCI in Fig. 10. This same overlap is provided by the cards for card lever contacts DCL and RCL. The first card will close such contacts at the 14 point in the cycle, keep the contacts closed during the remaining part of the cycle, and such contacts are also closed during the first part'of the next cycle from D. to 14. The larger heavier timing line between D and 14 indicates this overlap. The above makes it clear that successive cards keep contacts DCL and RCL closed. As shown in Fig. 6 the gear 85 meshes with an idler pinion H6 which is in mesh with a gear H'I attached to the shaft I 98 of the emitter in the punching machine. The brush H9 engages the segment H5 and the brush I20 engages one of a series of segments PM. 
By the gear driving connections shown the segments I2I are caused to be engaged by the brush I 20 in the order that the corresponding index points of the card to be punched are presented to the punches H 0 of the punching machine. From the segments lZI there are wire connections in a cable I22 which lead from the punching machine and as shown in Fig. 7a to electrical devices of the distantly located cash register. If, for example, the brush structure 57 (Fig. 1) should be positioned to represent 9 then the card will be perforated at the nine index point position to represent 9 by the following electrical connections. At the time the 9 index point is beneath the punch |I0 brush I20 engages the 9 segment I2I, extending the line through a wire in cable I22 to the segment 589 (Fig. 7b) 
which is engaged by its related brush structure 51 and by its commutator segment 53 the line is extended to a plug socket I23. 
 By a plug connection I24 the line extends by a wire I25 to a socket I23, and thence by a plug connection I21 to a punch control magnet I28, which leads to the positive line side 3|. Only one emitter is necessary for a series of read-out devices.of the cash register and the banks of keys which are to control punching operations are selected by the plug connections I23. Also punching in the desired card columns can be selected by the plug connections I21. Thus, as the card is stepped along it is punched in the various colums. Any suitable punching mechanism may be provided and the following is a description of a preferred form which is shown in detail in the application of C. D. Lake, Serial No. 685,379, August 9, 1933, now Patent No. 2,032,805, dated March 3, 1936. 
 After leaving the first set of rollers I33 the card is fed between a stripper plate I33 and die plate I3 I. Then the card enters between the pair of feed rollers III which feed it between guide plates I32 of a sensing station. A card lever RCL (Fig. 5) is operated as the card passes between sensing brushes I33 and a contact roller I34. 
 The selective operation of the punch plungers II3 will be explained with reference to Figs. 5 and 8. In Fig. 8 it is noted that the continually rotating shaft 34 is formed with an eccentric I35 which is encircled by an arm I33. The upper end of this arm is pivotally connected to an arm I31 on shaft I33 which is provided with another pair of arms I33. Between these arms I33 and a punch operating bail I43 there is provided an adjustable turnbuckle connection. A threaded rod I is pivoted at I42 on arm I33, and another rod I43 is pivoted at I44 on bail I43; both rods being connected by a double ended bolt I 45 which is adjustable to vary the position of the bail I43. 
 The ball I43 is pivoted on a stud I43 in the main side frames and carries a punch actuating bar I41 which is adapted to cooperate with notches I43 (Fig. 5) in any of a plurality of selected interposer pawls I43. Each of the punch plungers II3 has an interposer pawl I43 which is pivotally connected thereto by a pin I33. Normally the pawl I49 is held out of the path of the bar I41 (see Fig. 5) and the plunger H3 is held above the die by a spring I 5| attached to the pawl; However, 
when a magnet I23 is energized, the associated pawl is drawn into cooperation with bar I41 and the related plunger is subsequently depressed to perforate the card. 
 The armature I32 of the punch controlling magnet I23 is part of a lever I33 pivoted at I54. The lower end of lever I33 is pivotally connected to a call wire I55 the other end of which is pivoted at I33 on pawl I43. A plurality of such connections are made, one to each pawl, the magnets I23 being arranged in staggered rows and columns. The brackets I31 carry the ma nets of one row as a unit, and have arms I33 which hold an insulation bar I33 suspended above the magnets to function as a terminal bar. 
When attracted, the armature I32 swings the lever I53 in a clockwise direction, Fig. 8, and 
draws the wire I55 to the left, urging pawl I43 into cooperation with bar I41. The wires I 33 are guided by a slotted plate I33, and the pawls I43 are aligned by slots in a plate I3I fastened on a supporting bar I32, the plate I" also being used to secure one end of springs IN. The edge of bar I32 cooperates with a cam face I33.;n, each of the pawls I43 to hold the selected pawls into cooperation with bar I41 as the bar I41 is lowered An extension I34 on a fixed bar I35 cooperates with the upper ends of the pawls to cam them in a clbckwise direction out of engagement with the ascending bar I41 on the return stroke of the bail. In order to positively hold the pawls in disengaged position, the end of bar I41 cooperates with a cam face I33 on each pawl. There is a limit to the downward motion of the plungers I I3 because of the presence of a fixed bar I31 which projects into notches I33 cut in the side of plungers I I3. The plungers are guided above the holes in the die I3I by sliding in holes in a fixed bar I39 and the stripper plate I33. 
 The operation of punching is timed to occur during the pause in card feeding when the Geneva wheel 93 (Fig. 9) is not in action. The eccentric I35 (Fig. 8) is placed on the shaft 34 in such a position that the bail I43 is reciprocated while the roller 33 is out of engagement with wheel 33. As the bail I 43 and bar I41 are reciprocated, any of the pawls may be moved over by the call wires until notches I48 engage the end of bar I 41. Then the connected pawls and plungers are depressed to perforate the card and quickly withdraw therefrom to permit the feeding of the card to continue to the next index position. 
 Referring to the wiring diagram, it will be recalled that magnet 33 is held energized by the closure of contacts CC--2, since closure of contacts 33a is retained by the continued'depression of the'start key ST, the operating cycle being so short in time that the operator will hold the key ST depressed sometime during the closure of the CC-2 contacts. Therefore, since contacts CC-'-I are closed at the start of the next operating cycle all necessary operations including the energization of the card feed magnet 13 will always be effected at a definite point in the first cycle, although the cams on shaft 33 may not have been at a normal starting position when key ST was manually depressed. 
 A cycle is herein considered to be a single revolution of the cam carrying shaft 33 (Fig. 6). 
 After the start of the feeding of a card cam contacts FC-I close. These contacts, as shown in Fig. '6 are closed by a cam secured to the driven shaft 13 and therefore, as shown in Fig. 7a cause the energization of the relay magnet 33 and closure of contacts 330, thereby closing a stick circuit for relay magnet 33. To cause continued energization of magnet 33 there is provided a stick circuit for magnet 33 described as follows: from the positive line side 3 I, magnet 33, relay contacts 335, the left contacts 243!) now closed, ejector card lever contacts ECL-I now closed, to the negative line side 33. Therefore, contacts 33a will remain closed as long as the last described stick circuit is held closed. The motors M and N will continually operate because contacts 33b are held closed by continued energization of relay magnet 33. 
 Attention is directed to the fact that when contacts 33b are opened due to the energization of relay magnet 33 the circuit for card feed clutch magnet 13 is opened to prevent repeated energization of this magnet 13 even though contacts CC'I close during the next cycle of operation. Hence, only one card will be fed from the hopper 31 (Fig. 5) during the successive cycles of machine operation. The pair of rollers I II continue to rotate so as to feed the card past the analyzing brushes I33. The first cycle of operation in which card feed occurs brings the leading 6 edge ofthe card to the line of punches I I0, while the second cycle of operation inwhich punching occurs brings the leading edge of the card to the analyzing brushes I33, at which position of the card. card lever contacts RCL will be closed. 
From Fig. 711 it will be evident that closure of card. 
lever contacts RCL during the second cycle of operation will cause relay magnet I to be enersized which will cause the closure of its contacts "011 and H022. 
 During the first part of the second cycle of machine operation the aforementioned card lever contacts DCL closed and when contacts CC4 close at the end of this cycle a circuit described as follows is closed, from the positive line side 6|, a feeding roller clutch magnet I1I, wire I12, cam contacts CC4, card lever contacts DCL, to the negative line side 60. Magnet IN is shown in Fig. 6 and is adapted to cause the operation of supplemental sets of feeding rollers during the third cycle of machine operation, in which the punched card is analyzed. 
 Referring to Fig. 6 it will be evident that the gear I03 is in mesh with a'gear I12a which is loosely mounted on a shaft I13 but rotatable with a notched disk I14. Secured to the shaft I 13 is an arm I carrying the usual clutch pawl I16. 
I To the shaft I13 there is secured a gear I11 (Fig. 9) in mesh with a larger gear I10. While in Fig. 9 it appears that the gear I11 is in mesh with gear I03 it should be noted that gear I03 is in a diiferent plane and is in mesh with the gear I12a, as shown in Fig. 6. The armature of clutch magnet I1Iv is designated by numeral I1Ia. The operation of this clutch is similar to the clutch controlled by magnet 10 and a more detailed description, therefor, need not be given. At the beginning of the start of the third machine cycle, the notch in disk I 14 will be engaged by the clutch pawl I16 and gear I18 will then be driven in a step-by-step fashion since it is controlled by the Geneva gear wheel 96. Gear I18 is secured to a shaft I19 and by intermeshing gears I80 drives a pair of rollers I8I (Fig. 5). A gear I82 (Fig. 6) 
in mesh with one of the gears I80 drives one of a Pair of intermeshing gears I83 to drive a pair of feeding rollers I84 (Fig. 5). Meshing with gear I18 (Fig. 6) is a gear I85 in mesh with a gear I86 secured to a shaft I81. Shaft I81 carries a gear I 88 in mesh with a gear I89 to drive a pair of feeding rollers I90 (Fig. 5). Idler gear I9I (Fig. 6) driven by a gear I 88 is in mesh with one of a pair of intermeshing gears I92 to drive the last set of feeding rollers I93 (Fig. 5). 
 It should be observed that magnet "I is held energized after the first revolution of the disk I14 to prevent a disengagement of the clutch pawl I16 from the disk I14 after the first revolution of the disk I14. This is done because the gear ratios selected and employed in the machine of Patent No. 2,032,805 require a second revolution of shaft I13 during the middle of the third cycle of machine operation so as to feed in the present machine the card entirely past the analyzing brushes I33. Referring to the wiring diagram Fig. 7a and Fig. 6; it will be seen that the armature of clutch magnet I'II closes contacts 694 when clutch magnet I18 is energized. During the last part of the second cycle as previously stated when contacts CC4 close to energize clutch magnet I1I contacts ICC-I6 are also closed at this time and the latter are retained closed during the middle or the third cycle of machine operation'to retain the 5 energization of magnet I1! during the thirdcycle of operation by providing a stick circuit for magnet I1I through contacts I94. By timing contacts CCIG so as to be closed at the completion of the first revolution of shaft I13 the continued energization of magnet I1I will retain pawl I16 in engagement with the notch of disk I14 and as the pawl I 16 will not be rocked out of engagement with the notch of the disk a second revolution thereof will be effected. Card lever contacts DCL by virtue of the passage of the card past the related card lever have .opened and are, of course, open at the end of the third cycle of operation so that even though contacts CC4 and CC- -IG close during the end of the third cycle of operation the circuit to magnet I1I will not berclosed' and the card will be stopped between rollers ;I8I v and I84. 
 During the third cycle of operation the punched card is fed past the analyzing brushes I33 with a step-by-step motion. Referring to Fig. 7a, and recalling that card lever contacts RCL are closed during the third cycle of operation and, therefore, relay magnet I10 is energized to retain contacts I10b closed, contacts I10b extend the negative line side 60 by a wire I94a through animpulse distributor ID to a brush I95 in continuous contact with the metallic contact roller I34. 
The series of brushes I33 engage the roller I34 through the card perforations. Bymeans of plug connections I96 the card columns which are perforated are selected for controloperations-and obviously the columns selected will correspond to those punched by punches H0; From plug'connections I96 there are wire connections I91 connected to relay contacts I98 which are now closed. The series of relay contacts I98 is connected to clutch control magnets I99, all of which are wired to the positive line side 6|. As the perforations are analyzed during the passage of the card obviously the clutch control magnets I 99- will be energized at differential times. The magnets I99 are also shown in Fig. 5 and, obviously,are a part of the punching machine. 
 From Fig. 6 it will be observed that the continually rotating gear 84 is in mesh with a gear 200 which is in mesh with a gear 20I secured to a shaft 202. The shaft 202, as will be observed from Fig. 5, drives a shaft 203 by means of a gear 204 secured to shaft 202 which is in mesh with a gear 205 secured to shaft 203. The gear 203 rotates continually and in synchronism with the shaft I 13 (Fig. 6) which drives the .feeding rollers which feed the card past the analyzing brushes I33. 
 The magnets I99 are adapted to set brushes 206 of a read-out device in the punching machine in a manner by means similar to that shown and described in the aforementioned Patent No. 1,921,454. In general, a magnet I99 is adapted to attract its armature to release a clutch control lever 201 to permit a clutch connection to be effected by a clutch 208. This clutch will connect the shaft 203 with a gear 209 to rotate the latter when the magnet I99 is energized. 
 This rotationwill commence when a perforation is analyzed and terminate at the end of the cycle, thus setting the gear 209 and the brush 206 rotatable therewith a diiferential amount. Brush 206 will now engage with a particular segment 2I0 card are read out and set up on the read-out device shown in Fig. 5. 
\ The impulse distributor I. D. referred to and shown in Fig. 7a is of the usual construction and comprises a commutator rotating synchronously with-the feeding of the card. Wire 181a is connected to a ring of the commutator which is electrically connected to all the segments, while the brush connected to the contacts i'lflb engages the segments at the times the analyzing brushes I33 analyze the index-points oi the card. Hence, if there is a perforation at a particular index-point an electrical impulse will be directed to the appropriatemagnet i99. 
 During the third cycle of machine operation it will be-recalled card lever contacts RCL (Fig. 5) closed causing, as stated, the energization of relay magnet I10 (Fig. 7a) and the closure of relay contacts .i'lfla. When cam contacts CC-S close at the end of this cycle a circuit for a relay magnet 213 will be closed through the relay contacts "a, as shown in Fig. 7a. A stick circuit for relay magnet 2i3 will be effected by the closure of relay contacts 2 I So closed by relay magnet 2I3, extending the circuit from contacts H311 to spring closed contacts 2l4b (Fig. 7b) and thence to the negative line side 60. Contacts 2| 4?) and the related relay magnet 2 are located in the cash register. 
 When relay magnet 233 is energized contacts 2l3b (Fig. 7a) close. Relay magnet 2M and a relay magnet 2l5 (Fig. 7b) are each connected to the positive line side 6i and both are in series with contacts 2l3b (Fig. 7a) The circuit for magnets 2H and 2i5 in the punching machine then extends from contacts M31: in the punching machine through contacts FCC-i in the cash register to the negative line side to thus cause relay magnets 214 and H to be energized since cam contacts RCC-i are closed at the beginning of a cycle of machine operation of a read-out device in the cash register. 
 Referring now to Fig. 3 it will be evident that motor N, which at this time is running continually, drives a shaft 31$ through a Worm wheel and gear mechanism 3i? and shaft 316 is adapted to rotate a series of cams for closing contacts in the cash register designated as, REC-Pl, ECG-2, RCC3 and RCC-J; cam contacts RCC4 being shown in Fig. 3. 
 Shaft Sid continually revolves and while the magnet 2 it may be energized at any time during the cycle of operation of shaft tit, cam contacts RCC-l close at the end of one cycle of operation of the shaft 3M and are closed at the beginning of the cycle of operation of shai't 351% to initiate certain operations in the cash register at a dell-- nite time in the first effective cycle. This is analogous to depression of the start key ST when the contact operating cams of the punching machine may be of! normal but causing its operations to start at a definitely timed starting point in the first cycle. 
 When relay magnet 2!! is energized, referring to Fig. 7b, relay contacts 2H?) will open thereby attempting to open the stick circuit of magnet 2 i8 but to prevent this contacts ECU-*3 are shunted across the relay contacts 2 Nb and they keep the stick circuit of relay magnet H3 closed during the opening of contacts 2H!) and for a short time thereafter to thus prevent deenergization of relay magnets 2 and 215 by the opening oi! contacts 2l3b. 
 A stick circuit for relay magnets 2M and 215 is provided by contacts REC-4, which are closed at the time contacts ROG-4 close, and contacts 2 Ha which are now closed due to the energization of relay magnet 2. As stated above the energization of magnet 2 is held over by cam contacts ROG-4 and contacts 2H0 are closed "when contacts ROG-2 close. 
Due to the above described circuit ior relay magnet 2 contacts 2H0 (Fig. 7b) are closed by the energization of relay magnet 2 to perform a function now to be described. Contacts 214:: are closed by the energization of relay magnet 2 it and the latter. is held energized by the cam contacts ECG-2 during the time a brush 2i6 (Fig. 7b) of an emitter designated Emitter #3" in Fig. 7b passes the series of nine segments 211. The emitter Just described is also shown in' Fig. 3 and the brush structure thereof is rotated by means of a gear m secured to shaft 315 meshing with a gear 219 secured to a shaft 220 to which the brush structure 2i is secured. As the brush 216 passes the segments 2!! a series of impulses will be transmitted by lines wires in a cable 22! (Fig. 7a and Fig. 771) connected between the cash register and the punching unit. 
 With respect to Fig. 5 it will be recalled that the brushes 206 of the read-out device in the punching machine have been diflerentially set in accordance with the values punched on the record card, since the analyzing of the card by brushes i33 determined their diflerential setting. The brushes 20B are also shown'in the lower lefthand corner of Fig. la and also the segments 210. The horizontal series of segments 2 i ii iorthe same digit is connected in multiple, as explained fully in the aforementioned Patent No. 1,921,454 since a single emitter may be used to send impulses for a plurality of orders oi? the read-out device. Segments 2M are connected by ten line wires 222 to the segments 2 i! but the electrical connections are made in an inverse manner. That is for example, the segment 2479, of the emitter designated "Emitter No. 3 in Fig. 7b is connected to all the segments 2W representing the digit "1, segment 2ila to all segments representing the digit 2, etc. Now ii a brush designated 2%: should engage segment 2351, when brush 2|6 engages the segment 2 lie an impulse will be directed from the negative line side 60, (Fig. 7b) contacts 2 Hie, through the emitter, line wire 2221, (Fig. 7a) segment 2W1, brush 2681, to its common segment M2 and thence by a wire 22 to contacts H51, (Fig. *ibl now closed, to magnet 22% and thence to the positive line side ti. Hence an impulse will be directed at the 9 point in the cycle instead of at point 1 since brush 2M1 was previously set to represent the digit 1. In a similar manner, electrical impulses are directed to magnets 225 at points in the cycle which are complementai to the amount represented by the setting or the various brushes 2%. 
 Referring to Fig. 7b a series of contacts 2i51-1c and 25511 are closed by the previous energization oi the relay magnet 2W. Magnets 225 are arranged in the cash register, as shown in i, and they are adapted to cause the rotation of the brushes 5! from their difierentially adiusteol positions a complemental extent, and if all adjustments were correctly made, to a normal starting or "0 position; in which case the brush previously engaging the segment $39 110? engages the 9 segment 53. 
Shaft 318 (Fig. 1) which is continually rotating has attached thereto a gear wheel 228 in meshwith a gear 221 secured to a shaft 228. when a magnet 22-5 is energized it is adapted to effect the usual clutch connection between the shaft 228 and gear 55. When magnet 225 is energized it releases a clutch lever 229 to engage a clutch 230, one element of which is secured to the shaft 228 and the other to the gear 55. The clutch device referred to is well known and described in many patents, and Patent No. 1,307,740 to C. D. Lake, dated June 24, 1919, may be examined for a more complete disclosure. As the gears 55 are turned complementally the brush previously engaging the segment 59 should after this operation engage the segment 58 representing In further detail, in a, cycle of machine operation when such'a clutch as clutch 230 (Fig. 1) is engaged at the 9 point in the cycle gear 56 would be turned nine steps. Hence, if a brush 206 in the read-out device stood at a position to represent 1, instead of energizing magnet 225at the 1 point in the cycle to turn gear 56 one step, the inverted wire connections between the emitter 2I6, 2H, 220 and the readout device in the punching machine comprising line wires 222 of cable 22l would cause the gear 56 to be turned nine steps, in the example just assumed. 
 It is-further pointed out that the two read-out devices 51 and 206 shown in Figs. 1 and are constructed as disclosed in the patent to G. F. Daly, 1,921,454, and they are also similar in construction of certain parts to the usual Hollerith accumulator shown in Patent No. 1,307,740 except that they do not have the tens carry mechanism shown in the last cited patent. This permits the resetting of the read-out devices to zero by the clutches which in Patent No. 1,307,740 
 are used for entering items in the accumulator iii but in the present machine are utilized to re-set the brush carrying elements to zero position. 
 As is shown in the lower part of Fig. 7b the energization of the relay magnet 2l5 closes contacts 2l511 and these contacts are in series with cam contacts RCC4 which close after the brushes 5! have been reset to zero position, thereby extending the negative line side 60 to a wire 23I and cause the energization of a relay 232 since the latter is connected at one side to the wire 23! and at the other side to the positive line side 6|. 
 Relay contacts 232a thereupon close, providing a stick circuit for relay magnet 232 from the positive line side 6| through these contacts and normally spring closed relay contacts 23% (Fig. 7a) which are connected to the negative line side 60. 
 It will be recalled thatthe cam carrying shaft 86 (Fig. 6) of the punching unit is also rotating and obviously when the 60-6 (Fig. 7a) contacts close by a cam secured to shaft 86 a circuit for relay magnets 233 and 234 will be closed, described as follows: The positive "line side 65, magnets 233 and 234 in multiple,- cam contacts (JO-6, contacts 2325 to the negative line side 60. Energization of the magnet 233 opens contacts 233D but the latter are shunted by cam contacts CC-0 which are now closed and this effectively prevents the deenergization of relay magnets 233 and 234 by the opening of contacts 232b, which would be performed if relay magnet 232 was deenergized by opening contacts 2331). 
 As relay magnet 233 is now energized contacts 233a.- close and since cam contacts 00-! are timed to be closed when cam contacts CC -6 are closed, a stick circuit for relay magnets 233 and 234 will be provided by relay contacts 233a and cam contacts CC-l but the stick circuit is opened at the end of the cycle by opening of contacts CC-l. 
 It should also be observed with reference to Fig. 75 that when contacts RCC-Z opened during the cycle of operation in which and after the brushes 5'! were returned to normal that relay magnets 2 l4 and 2l5 were deenergized. 
 Hence relay contacts 2|51 i1 will now be opened electrically disconnecting magnets 225 from the read-out device of the punching machine shown in the lower left hand corner of Fig. 7a. 
 The energization of the relay magnet 234 will cause the concurrent closure of a series of ten relay contacts 2341 to 23410 (see Fig. 7a) and the opening of the series of relay contacts I98. As relay magnet 233 is now energized it will also cause the closure of its relay contacts 2330 (Fig. 7a) thereby extending the negative line side 60 through closed contacts 2330 to a collector segment 236 of an emitter 231 provided in the punching unit, which is drivenby the shaft H8 and designated as Emitter No. 2 in Fig. 7a. The construction of this emitter is precisely the same as the emitter shown in Fig. 3 and further description need not be given in view of the detailed description previously given for like Emitter #1. The segments 238 of -the emitter are connected to the several seriesof like segments 2|0 of the read-out device in an inverse manner, similar to that previously described. The complementary timed electrical impulses will be transmitted by line wires 239 to the clutch control magnets I99 through the closed c0ntacts2341 1o, since contacts 2|51-m (Fig. 7b) are now open. Magnets I99 (Fig. 5) now receiving the electrical 'iinpulses will cause the brushes 206 to rotate in the same direction they were turned to secure their differential adjustment. The series of brushes 206 will now be reset to their normal position. It should be noted that when a brush structure (of either read-out device) is turned a complemental extent that one of the brushes engages the zero segment and in each instance it will comprise the brush which previously engaged the common segmental collector, identified by numeral 59 in Fig. 1 or 2l2 in Fig. 5. 
 Referring to Fig. 7a it will be noted that the energization of relay magnet 233 has also closed contacts 233d, thus extending the negative line side to cam contacts CC-l0 which are timed to close after the brush structures are reset to their normal positions. This extends the circuit to the segment 2l0o which is engaged by a. special brush 206a. It should be explained with reference to Figs. 5 and 7a that rotatable with each brush structure 206 is a supplemental brush structure, one being designated 2060. in Fig. 7a. This brush at the normal or reset position is in engagement with a single segment 2060 and a supplemental collector segment 2060. In other words for each denominational order of the read-out device there is a duplication of the structure shown in Fig. 5 and shown diagrammatically in Fig. 7a. The segments of the different orders corresponding to segment 2060 are connected by wire connections 240, and in view of the engagement of the brushes, such as 206a, with their segments 2060 and zero contact points 2060 the circuit is extended by a line wire 24l to the zero segment of the read-out device of the cash register shown in Fig. 7b. The read-out device of the cash register is constructed similarly to that for the punching machine and if the card was punched to represent the same amount as the item set up on the cash register the circuit will be extended, by similar connections described with reference to Fig. 7a, to a wire 242 to cause the energization of'a relay magnet 243 (Fig. 7a). 
It will be understood that following the cycle of operation of the resetting devices for the readout device of the cash register the punching machine goes through the fourth effective cycle of operation. During this fourth effective cycle of operation the punchingmachine read-out vdevice is reset and during this cycle of operation magnet "I (Fig. 6) is energized to cause the rotation of the feeding rollers IBI, I64, I99 and I93 during the fifth effective cycle of operation by the following electrical control. 
 When magnet 243 (Fig. 7a) is energized relay contacts 243a are closed, thus providing a stick circuit for relay magnet 243 through the right contacts 243b closed when relay magnet 243 is energized, through card lever contacts ECL2 now closed, to the negative line side. This circuit will retain magnet 243 continuously energized until card lever contacts ECL2 open. 
 It will be recalled that magnet 66 is still energized and to prevent its stick circuit through the left contacts 24317 from being opened due to the energization of magnet 243 which opens the left contacts 24%, cam contacts CC-3 are provided. These are shunted across the left contacts 2431; and close a little time before and also when contacts CC-IO close. Thus, the stick circuit for magnet 66 will extend through contacts 66a, cam contacts CC-3, card lever contacts ECLI, to the negative line side. When the right contacts 2432) close the stick circuit for relay magnet 66 is transferred to the right contacts 243!) now providing a common stick circuit for both magnets 66 and 243. 
 At the beginning of the fourth effective cycle of operation cam contacts CC--1 are closed which retain the energization of the relay 234 and the closureof contacts 23411 (Fig. 7a). When cam contacts CC9 close a circuit for the clutch control magnet l1l will be completed by the closure of cam contacts CC--9 and contacts 23411. 
'Cam contacts CC--l6 together with the closure of contacts I94 which are closed by the energization of magnet I" provide the usual stick circuit for magnet Ill, thus continuing the energization of magnet ill at the beginning of the fifth effective cycle of operation. At this time the notch in disk I14 (Fig. 6) will be engaged by the end of the clutch pawl I16 thus causing the feeding rollers l8l, I64, I99 and 493 to rotate. Cam contacts CCI6 retain the energization of magnet l1l during the fifth cycle beyond the middle thereof so that another rotation of shaft I13 will ensue, which necessity was previously described. 
 When cam contacts CCI6 open magnet Ill will be deenergized. However, contacts CC--9 close shortly thereafter and since contacts 2430 are now closed (because card lever contacts ECL2 are closed) another energization of mag-- net ill will be effected and its energization will be continued and extended to and during the sixth effective cycle of operation by cam contacts CCI-6. 
 It will be noted that cam contacts CC1 open near the end of the fourth effective cycle of operation to cause magnets 233 and 234 to be deenergized. Of course, this causes relay contacts 23411 to be opened so contacts 2430 are provided to cause the energization of magnet l1! when cam contacts CC-9 close. These contacts 2430 are shunted across contacts 23411. 
' At the beginning of the fifth cycle of operation the card is between sets of rollers l6l, I84, (Fig. 5) and at the end of the fifth efiective cycle the card is between the sets of rollers l93--l84. 
At the beginning of the sixth cycle the card is still being fed and by means of the rollers I93 the card which has been found to be punched correctly is fed into a receptacle 245. At the beginning of the sixth effective cycle of operation card lever contacts ECL2 open, thus resulting in the deenergization of magnets 243 and 66. 
 Since relay magnet 66 is now deenergized stick contacts 660 (Fig. 7a, upper middle) will open to cause deenergization of relay magnet 63. Contacts 63?) will now open to attempt to stop the operation of motor N of the cash register and motor M of the punching device. It should be noted that cam contacts CC2 are shunted across contacts 660 and they will hold the energization of relay magnet 63 even though contacts 660 open. This will insure a sufficient operation of the motor M so that feed rollers I93 will feed the card to allow it to drop in the receptacle 245. It should be noted that when contacts 6311 (Fig. 711) closed due to the energization of relay magnet 63 caused by the depression of the start key ST that by a wire 246 a circuit for a looking magnet 241 (Fig. 7b) was closed. Magnet 241 is shown in Fig. 4 and when energized it operates a lever 248 to bring a notch 249 thereof into locking cooperation with a square stud 250 attached to the gear 3|. This will prevent any operation of the cash register during the operation of the punching machine and in view of the holding of contacts 63d closed during the six cycles of operation the magnet 241 will retain the locking lever 246 in a locking position during this time. When contacts 63d open the operating handle 29 (Fig. 4) will be unlocked so that another item entry operation may be instituted. 
 The last described operation assumes that the card was punched correctly and corresponded in each column punched with the value of the item entered by the various banks of keys of the cash register. If the card is punched to represent the incorrect amount, this amount will, nevertheless, be set up on the read-out device of the punching machine and will subsequently be reset. The true amount which was to be punched on the card was, however, set up on the read-out device of the cash register and as this read-out device is reset under control of the incorrectly set read-out device of the punching machine, one or another of the brush structures 51 will fail to return to normal position. Hence, the circuit to the relay magnet 243 will not be energized when contacts CCI close at the end of the resetting of the read-out device of the punching machine. Under certain other conditions, relay magnet 243 will also fail to be energized when contacts CC-lll close. For example, the amount entered in the cash register may be correctly represented by perforations on the card but due to some mechanical or electrical failure one or another of the brush structures 291 of the read-out device of the punching machine (see Fig. will not be turned to normal. Again; the brush structures 51 (Fig. 1) of the read-out device of the cash register may not return to normal due to some mechanical or electrical failure, even though the read-out device of the punching machine was correctly set to represent the amount entered on the cash register. 
 It is desirable that the operator be apprised of any of the above described faulty operations, or others, since the correctness of subsequent card punching operations is entirely dependent upon whether or not the read-out devices of the punching machine and cash register are at normal at the beginning of an item entry operation of the cash register. There will now be described the means whereby incorrectly unched cards'will be selectively disposed in a reject pocket designated by numeral 25! in Fig. 5. 
 As previously stated during the fourth cycle of operation of the punchingmachine in which the read-out device of the punching machine is reset, contacts CCID close but since the circuit to relay magnet 243 (Fig. 7a) is not closed when the brush structures of either read-out device are not at normal contacts designated 243d (Fig. 7a) will remain closed. 
 However, the energization of the clutch control magnet I'H (Fig. 7a) will be effected by the circuit previously traced and described so that the incorrectly punched card will be fed during the fifth effective cycle of machine operation. 
 When the card is fed to the left (Fig. 5) by the rollers l8l card lever contacts ECL-l of the left pair (Fig. 7a) will be closed early in the cycle and since at this time contacts designated 243d (Fig. 7a) are closed, it will be observed that a circuit for a relay magnet 252 will be closed, said circuit leading from the positive line side 6| through magnet 252, contacts 243d now closed, card lever contacts ECL-l of the left pair now closed to the negative line side 60. 
 Relay contacts 252a will now close providing a stick circuit for the relay magnet 252 through contacts 252a, stop key contacts SP1 of the punching machine and stop key contacts SP2 (Fig. 7b) of the cash register. The energization of magnet 252 will continue until either of these stop key contacts are manually opened. 
 It should be observed that the opening of the right (Fig. '70.) card lever contacts ECL-l (Fig. 7a) will open the circuit to the magnet 66. This will result in the opening of contacts 660 and the subsequent deenergization of relay magnet 63 when cam contacts CC-2 open late in the cycle. The deenergization of the magnet 63 caused by the opening of contact CC--2 will permit the opening of contact 6311 and attempt to cause the deenergization of the'locking control magnet '24! (see Fig. 7b) to release the cash register for operation. However, under the incorrect conditions now being assumed, it is necessary that the cash register be locked and it is maintained locked by means of contacts 252d (Fig. 7a) upper right which were closed previous to the opening of contacts 6311. When looking magnet 24! (Fig. 7b) was energized, it closed its contacts 241a. The circuit for the locking magnet 24'' will therefore now be extended through contacts 241a, maintained by contacts 25211, to the positive line side 6|. As previously stated, magnet 252 which causes contacts 252d to be closed will be retained energized until either the stop key of the cash register or the stop key of the punching machine is manually depressed. The depression of either stop key will therefore release the cash register for a subsequent entry operation. i 
 There will now be described certain operations which take place after the resetting of the readout device of the punching machine which, it will be recalled, occurs during the fourth effective cycle of machine operation. 
 Referring to Fig. 'laand understanding that since magnet 243 is not now energized due to an incorrect reset operation, it will be noted that contacts 243e will remain closed. Whencam contacts CC-H close, cam contacts CC-1 are also closed for retaining magnet 233 energized, so that contacts 233e are closed. A circuit will therefore be instituted from the negative line side 60 (Fig. 7a) through relay contacts 233e now closed, relay contacts 243e now closed, cam contacts CCH now closed, to a magnet 256 which is connected to the positive line side 6i. When magnet 256 is energized, it causes the closure of its own contacts 256a to provide a stick circuit through these contacts, contacts 251a, cam contacts CC-IZ to the negative line side 60. Cam contacts 00-! 2 are timed to be closed at the time contacts CC-'| and CC-l| are closed. Cam contacts CC-l2 will, therefore, continue the energization of magnet 256 at the beginning of the fifth effective cycle of machine operation. At the beginning of this cycle of operation, card feeding rollers I84 (Fig. 5) which engage the leading edge of the card are rotated. When the magnet 256 (see Fig. 6) is energized, it will attract its armature 258 to rock a shaft 259 to which the armature is attached. Attached to the shaft 259 as observed in Fig. 5 is a vane or card deflecting plate 260. When the magnet is energized, the free end of the deflector plate 260 is elevated a slight extent and as the incorrectly punched card is now being fed by the rollers I84, it will be observed that the card is guided in the reject pocket 25! during the fifth effective cycle of machine operation. 
 It is desirable that magnet 256 remain energized during this cycle of operation and during a portion of the next in order to insure that the card will be properly fed. The following described circuits adequately provide and insure the desired operation. 
 During the 'fifth eifective cycle of machine operation, contacts CC-l3 close and since contacts CC--l2 are now closed, the negative line side 60 will be extended through cam contacts CC-IZ, contacts 251a, contacts 256a, through cam contacts CC-l3 to a relay magnet 251. This will cause the opening of contacts 251a and an attempt to open the circuit to relay magnets 256 and 251. However, at the time contacts CCI3 close, contacts CC|4 are also closed and since contacts CC-|4 are shunted across contacts 251a neither relay magnets 256 nor 251 will be deener'gized. When relay magnet 251 is energized, 
relay contacts 251D will be closed thereby extending a circuit from the negative line side through cam contacts CC-l5 which are closed at-the time cam contacts 00-" open, a wire 26! relay contacts 251!) now closed, contacts 256a, relay magnet 256 to the positive line side. Obviously, the energization of the deflector control magnet 256 is now under control of the cam con tacts CCI5. Since cam contacts CC|5 are closed at the time contacts CC-l3 close, relay magnet 251 will be held energized under control of cam contacts CCI5. When relay magnet 25! is energized, it will close its contacts 2570, and as said contacts are in series with cam contacts CC-l5 it will be noted that the energization of relay magnet 25'! will now be continued and placed under control of the cam contacts CC--I5 after cam contacts CC|3 open.. 
 When cam contacts CC-|5 open, relay magnets 256 and 257 will be deenergized and due to the deenergization of magnet 256, the deflector plate 266 (Fig. 5) will assume its normal position shown in Fig. 5. by means of a spring 262 (Fig. 6) 
' attached to the armature 258 of magnet 256. 
 While the preceding description has described a machine which is fully operative for all purposes, there will now be described certain adjuncts in the nature of distinctive signalling devices which indicate to the operators of the cash register and the punching machine that certain operations'have been properly completed or improperly carried out. 
 These various signal devices are illustrated only in the electrical wiring diagram in Figs. 7a and 7b but are attached to the different machines. Reference numerals 263 and 26% indicate electrical lamps which are colored green. The lamp 263 is located at the punching machine for observance by the operator controlling the punching machine while the lamp 264 is visible to the operator of the cash register since it is located thereon. The circuit for lamps 261i and 264 start from the positive line side 6I, through contacts 63d which are closed when relay magnet 63 is energized, contacts 25212 which are closed when magnet 252 is deenergized and then from said contacts 252b to lamps 263 and 264, the other side of each lamp being connected to the negative side. If the punching operation has been correct and both of the read-out devices have been returned to normal, magnet 63 will remain energized and relay magnet 252 deenergized thereby causing their respective contacts 63d and 25217 to be closed. 
 Therefore, when the start key of the cashregister ST is depressed, lamps 263 and 264' will be initially lighted and will remain illuminated until the end of the sixth effective cycle of the operation of the punching machine when they will be automatically extinguished. The illumination of the lamps informs both operators that the punching machine is in operation. 
 Distinctively colored lamps, designated 265 and 266, in the wiring diagram indicate to the operators of both machines that some operation has been incorrectly performed, as has been previously described. These lamps 265 and 266 are preferably colored red and they are illuminated during the operation of the punching machine when an incorrect operation has been performed. The circuits for both lamps 265 and 266 are controlled .by contacts 2520 which are closed when relav magnet 252 is energized. Such energization, it will be recalled, is instituted when either readout device fails to return to normal. 
 It is desirable that the operators of both machines be informed when there is no card in the hopper 61 of the punching machine. 
 It will be recalled that the card lever contacts MCL (Fig. 5) are closed only when there is a card in the magazine 61. On the presence of a card therein these contacts will close to cause the energization of relay magnet 69 and the opening of contacts 69b to extinguish a pa r of lamps. These lamps which indicate to the operators by their lighting the absence of a card in hopper 61 are preferably colored yellow and are designated by reference numerals 261 and 268. 
 One side of each of said lamps is connected to the positive line side 6| and the other sides of each of the lamps are connected to the negative line side through contacts 6%. Upon the feeding of the last card in the magazine both lamps will be illuminated informing the operators of this condition. When cards are replenished in the hopper 61 the lamps will again be extinguished. 
 It is, furthermore, desirable to perforate the card in one or more columns to designate some fixed data, as for example, the clerk operating the machine. In the event that the same clerk repeatedly operates the same cash register it is desirable that this repetition of data be effected automatically without the necessity of repeatedly depressing the same key. 
 Referring to Fig. 2, it will be understood from the well known construction of the cash register that when a key is depressed its detent segment I3 will be elevated and it will be held elevated by means of the usual spring urged locking bar 210 which upon depression of a key springs rearwardly so that its shoulder 2H engages the lower part'of the segment I3. The machine is provided with a conventional lock 212 and when the key 213 thereof is rotated by the clerk retaining the key 213 its latch 214 will engage a notch 215 of the raised detent I3. This will retain the de pressed key I6 continually depressed and effect the same setting of its gear 36 for each machine operation. Obviously, the brush structure 51 of the corresponding order will be rotated to the same position for each cash register operation. 
By means of the plug connections I24 (Fig. 7b) 
and I2! (Fig. 7a) this order of the read-out mechanism of the cash register can be plugged to control the energization of one of the punching control magnets I 26. 
 This will cause punching in a column to represent the same data, as for example, the clerk operating the machine, in each of a series of punched cards. 
 It is also desirable to designate on each card punched the number of the punching machine. This will permit identification of the source of punching. To this end the punching machine is provided with a read-out mechanism of preferably four orders to set up any digit from 0000-9999. The brush structures 216 (Fig. 5) of each order are manually settable by notched wheels 21! so that one of the brushes engages a particular segment 2T8 representing the digit set up. Obviously, the brush structures 276 remain in the position they are set. The emitter designated Emitter No. l in Fig. 7a also has wire connections in a cable 219 to the various segments, in the manner previously described, except in this case, the segment I2I of the emitter relat ing to a digit is connected in multiple to the segments 218 relating to the same digit of the read-out device now described and so on. In this instance it is desired to punch to represent the same numbers set up by the wheels 211 and the wire connections are not complementarily arranged in this case. By means of plug connections 280 (Fig. 7a) the read-out device may be plugged to control the energization of selected punch control magnets I28. These will control the punching of fixed data on each of a series of cards, representing, for example, the number of the punching machine, a date, etc.
