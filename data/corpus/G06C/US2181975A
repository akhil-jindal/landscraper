20 Claims. 
This invention relates to bookkeeping or accounting machines and the like, but more particularly to improvements in the operating and controlling mechanisms of machines of the type illustrated and described in Letters Patent of the United States Nos. 1,197,276 and 1,197,278, issued September 5, 1916, to Halcolm Ellis and U. S. Patent No. 1,819,084, issued August 18, 1931, to Emil John Ens. 
 Practically all the electrically operated adding and listing machines, commonly referred to as bookkeeping or accounting machines, of today have evolved from a hand-operated machine. Most of the earlier machines were equipped with a hand lever that operated an oscillating drive shaft which in turn actuated the mechanism of the machine. Later these machines were equipped with electric motors which oscillated the drive shaft in substantially the same manner as the hand lever. In this transition, the electric motors were merely added to the hand-operated machines and in most cases no attempt was-made to modernize or improve the operating and actuating mechanisms of the machine. 
 It is a well known engineering fact that from a manufacturing viewpoint a revolving drive shaft has many advantages over an oscillating drive shaft. For example, the greater latitude of movement of the revolving drive shaft, a cycle of operation of which consists of 360 degrees of movement, gives an increased range in the tim drive shafts limited to an approximate movement of 60 degrees in each direction. 
The various other advantages of the revolvingdrive shaft over the oscillating drive shaft will be revealed as the specification progresses. 
It is, therefore, an object of this invention to 2 provide accounting machines of the type referred to above with a revolving drive shaft. 
 Another object is to provide novel controlling means for the rotary drive shaft mechanism. 
 Still another object is to adapt the overdraft device for use with the rotary drive shaft mechanism. 
A further object is to supply an improved key struction and combination of parts, the essential elements of which are set forth in appended claims and a preferred form or embodiment of which is hereinafter described with reference to the drawings which accompany and form a part of this specification.

GENERAL Dnscmr'rron The machine of the instant invention is of the well known Ellis type and is equipped with a laterally shiftable traveling carriage supporting a platen roll adapted to present record material to Depending upon the use to which the machine is to be put, it may or may not be equipped with a typewriter keyboard and type for the entering of various data upon the record material. The machine of the present invention is equipped with a rotary drive shaft which replaces the conventional oscillating drive shaft used heretofore in machines of this type. A constantly running motor is operatively connected to the drive shaft by. means of a clutch mechanism nism. In all operations except overdraft operations, depressing the regular release bar causes the motor to turn the drive shaft one revolution to operate the machine through one cycle of movement. In overdraft operations, depressing the overdraft key causes the drive shaft to make three revolutions to operate the machine through three cycles of movement to transpose the complement of an overdraft into a true negative amount and print this amount on the record material carried by the platen roll. 
 The instant machine is equipped with four totalizers, one of which is an adding and subtracting or balance totalizer, the others are straight adding totalizers. The totalizers are actuated by a plurality of denominational .reciproeating racks which are in turn positioned in adding and subtracting operations under control of $181,975 Fig. 22 is a detail of a portion of the key rea plurality of amount keys arranged in denominational rows on the keyboard. In .total and subtotal operations the totalizer wheels position the racks to record the amount on said totalizer wheels. -There is a type carrier for each denomination and they are positioned by the actuator racks commensurate with the value of the depressed amount keys or the amount on the totalizer wheels. 
 The adding and subtracting functions of the instant machine are controlled by the traveling carriage in tabulated positions thereof and the other functions, including non-add, sub-total, total, repeat, and also subtract, are governed by a row of control keys located on the left side of the keyboard. Other features of the instant machine will be disclosed in the detailed description following. 
Dmnmm ba'scarrnon Framework and operating mechanism The mechanism of the machine is supported by a right frame 40 (Figs. 1, 2 and 21) and a left frame 4|, secured to a machine base 42, which also supports a suitable cabinet or case (not shown) that encloses the mechanism of the machine. Mounted on the machine case is a laterally shiftable traveling carriage similar to that used on typewriters, supporting a platen roll 43 (Fig. 12) which carries record material in proper relation to the type carriers, one of which, an 
amount segment 44, is here shown. Secured to the base 42 is an electric motor 45 (Figs. 1, 3 and 4) of the constantly running type geared to a clutch driving member 46 adapted to be frictionaliy connected to a clutch driven member 41, 
both of said clutch members being rotably supported by a stud 48 secured in the motor frame. Secured to a hub of the clutch driven member 41 is a gear. 49 connected by an intermediate gear 50, loose on a stud 5| in the motor frame, to a gear 82 secured on a main drive shaft 53, opposite ends of which are journaled in the frames 40 and 4 One end of a clutch band 54 (Fig. 3) is secured to the clutch driven member 41 while the other end thereof is connected to a bell crank it loose on a stud 56 in the member 41 and adjustably connected to an arm 51 also loose on the 'stud 58. The upper end of the arm 51 cooperates with a bent-over ear 58 of a lever 59 loose on a stud 60 in the motor frame. An upwardextension of the lever 59 is connected by a link Bl to an arm 62 loose on an auxiliary differential engaging shaft 63 journaled in the frames 40 and 4 l The arm 82 has a step 64 adapted to cooperate with a stud 85 in one arm of a three-armed lever 66 loose on a stud 61 in the frame 40. An upwardly extending arm of the lever 68 is bifurcated to embrace a stud 68 in a release plate 88 pivoted on a stud 10 in the frame 40. The plate 89 has a stud 1| straddled by the bifurcated lower end of a stem 12 of a starting bar 13 slidably supported by an auxiliary keyboard plate 90. Another stem 14 of the bar I3 is loosely connected by a stud 15 to a rearwardly disposed arm of the lever 66. A spring 16 urges the plate 89 clockwise and the lever 86 counterclockwise to normally maintain the stud in the path of the step 64. 
thereby causing it to grip the inner surface of the constantly revolving clutch driving member 48. 
 In all machine operations except overdraft operations, the clutch driven member 41,,the gear 52- and the main drive shaft 53 make one counterclockwise revolution. Near the end of rotation of the shaft 53, a stud 19 in the gear 50 engages an ear 80 of the lever 59 to rock said lever clockwise. Consequent clockwise movement of the arm 82 moves the step 54 beyond the stud 55, allowing the spring 18 to restore the lever 88 to normal position so that the stud 85 retains the plate 82 and lever 59 in untripped position. Return movement of the lever 59 moves the ear 58 in the path of the arm 51 which, upon engagement therewith, disengages the clutch driven member from the clutch driving member. 
 Loose on a stud 8I (Fig. 1) in the motor frame is a return lever 82 urged clockwise by a spring 83 tensioned between said lever and a stud 84. The upper end of the lever 82 has therein a camming notch, which, in cooperation with a roller 85 carried by the gear 49, completes return movement of the machine operating mechanism to home position after the clutch is disengaged as related above. An extension 88 of the lever 82 in cooperation with the stud 84 limits clockwise movement of said lever when the roller 85 moves out of engagement therewith. 
 Referring to Fig. 3, a. simple and efficient device is provided to prevent repeat operations of the machine in case the starting bar 13 is retained depressed. This mechanism includes a non-repeat latch 81 loose on the shaft 81. Said latch 81 is urged clockwise and normally maintained in contact with a stop stud 88 in the lever 68 by a spring 89. Clockwise releasing movement of the lever 88 moves a hook 93 of the latch 81 into the path of a similar hook 94 on the arm 82. In case the starting bar 13 is retained depressed during the restoration of the arm 62, the hook 93 latches over the hook 94 when the hook 94 is restored by stud 19 engaging ear 80, and prevents a repeat operation of the machine by retaining said arm 52 and the lever 59 in untripped position. As soon as pressure is removed from the bar 13, the lever 88 is restored counterclockwise by the spring 18, which disengages the hook 93 from the hook 94 and causes the stud 85 to reengage the step 54. A brace plate 95 (Fig. 1) supports the righthand ends of the studs 48, 5| and 8I. 
 Referring to Figs. 2 and 1'7, secured on the main drive shaft 53 are companion cams 98 and 91, the peripheries of which are adapted to cooperate with rollers 98 and 99 carried by a Y- shaped lever 'l00 loose on a stud MI in the frame 40. The lever I00 has a stud I02 which extends through a slot I03 in an arm I04 secured to a leading frame shaft I05 journaled in the frames 40 and 4|. During each machine operation, the earns 98 and 91, by means of the lever I00, oscillate thearm I04 and the shaft I05 first counterclockwise and then back to normal position through an approximate angle of 40 degrees. 
 Shownin Fig. 11 is the means for operating the printer mechanism. Secured on the main drive shaft 53 are companion cams I08 and I01 by a spring II4 to an arm II5 secured on a printer shaft 8 journaled in the frame 40 and in the printer frame (not shown). The notch in the link H2 is constantly engaged with the stud III except in overdraft operations, and the manner in which said link II2 functions in. overdraft operations will be described later herein. Counterclockwise revolution of the shaft 53 by means of the cams I08 and I01, the arm IIO, link H2 and arms H3 and H5 oscillate the printer shaft II8 first clockwise and then back to normal position to cause the printing mechanism to function. 
Totalizer and printer actuating mechanism Fig. 12 illustrates the totalizer and printer actuating mechanism for one denominational unit of the machine. As this mechanism is substantially duplicated in each denominational unit it is felt that the description of the one unit here shown will be sufficient for the purpose of this specification. 
 An' actuator leading frame H1 is formed by means of two depending arms secured at opposite ends of the shaft I05 connected by a cross-bar or bail II8. Loose on the shaft I05 is a printer reducingsegment II9, a downward extension of which is maintained in contact with the leading frame bail II8 by a spring I stretched between said reducing arm and said bail; The segment II9 carries a stud I2I embraced by a vertical slot in an actuator rack I22 mounted for horizontal reciprocating movement by means of a grooved rod I23 and a bar I24 cooperating with the rearwardly disposed bifurcated end of said rack I22. The rod I23 and the bar I24 are supported by the frames 40 and M. The rack I22 has a series of graduated steps I25 which cooperate with corresponding square studs I28 secured in the stems of amount keys I21. The upper ends of the amount keys I21 extend through apertures in a. keyboard plate I28. Each key I21 has a spring I29tensioned to urge said keys upwardly. When no amount key is depressed, the rack I22 is retained in zero position by means of a zero stop pawl (not shown) An arm I30 of the segment I I9 is connected by a link I3I to the printer segment 44 which is piv- Each pawl I38 has a bent-over lug I45 which overlies its higher order neighbor. Another projection of the plate I 34 is engaged by a printer release trigger I48 rotatably supported in the printer frame. 
 Depressing one of the amount keys I21 releases the zero stop pawl for its related rack I22 and moves the stud I28 of the depressed key into the path of the corresponding step I25 on said rack I 22. Initial movement counterclockwise of the shaft I05 and the leading frame II1 by means of the spring I20 moves the segment H9 and the rack I22 in unison therewith, Rearward movement of the rack I22 is halted when the step I25 engages the stud I28 of the depressed amount keys. However, the leading frame II1 completes its cycle of movement, stretching the spring I20. This positions the actuator rack commensurate with the value of the depressed key, and the segment 8, by means of the link I3I, positions the type carrier 44 accordingly. when the segment 8 moves away from zero position, the stud I44, in cooperation with the arcuate tail I43, rocks the zero elimination pawl I38 counterclockwise against the tension of a spring 9i to allow printing movement of the plate I34, arm I33 and type carrier 44. The pawl I38 by means of the over 10 lying ear I45 disengages all the lower order zero elimination pawls from their corresponding plates I34 so that the zeros will print in the lower denomination. When the leading frame Ill reaches the terminus of its initial movement counterclockwise, the printer release trigger I46 is rocked counterclockwise by mechanism (not shown) to release the plate I34 and the arm I33 to the action of the spring I36, which has been further tensioned by clockwise movement of the yoke I31. This causes the type carriers 44 to engage the conventional inking ribbon and carry it into contact with the record material wound around the platen roll 43 to record the value of the depressed key. 
 After an impression is completed, return movement clockwise of the leading frame Ill returns the segment H9, the rack I22 and the type carrier 44 to zero position, and return movement I counterclockwise of the yoke I31, by means of a rod I41 supported thereby, restores the plate I34 and the arm I33 to normal position as shown in I43 rock the frame I54 clockwise to cause an alining bar I56 carried thereby to engage the proper tooth space in the segment 9 to position said segment and the type carrier 44 during impression. Immediately after the impressio the aliner bar I56 is rocked out of engagement with the segment I I9. 
' Totalizers The machine of-this invention is equipped with four totalizers (Fig. 12) numberedfrom I to d, in the customary manner. The upper front or #I totalizer is an adding and subtracting or balance'totalizer, and the other three totalizers are adding totalizers. a 
 .In adding operations, after the rack I22 has been positioned as explained above, the corresponding wheel of the selected totalizer is rocked into engagement with one of the two sets of teeth carried by said rack, or one. of two sets of teeth carried by an extension I39 of the rack I22. Return movement forwardly of the rack I22 ro- 65 tates the wheel of the engaged totalizer commensurate with the value of the depressed amount key to add this amount therein. 
 In subtracting operations, the corresponding wheel of the No. I or balance totalizer is rocked 70 into engagement with the rack I22 prior to its initial movement rearwardly, which movement rotates said wheel reverselyto subtract the value of'the depressed amount key therefrom. Each of the totalizer wheels carries, a transfer cam I40 which, when a totalizer wheel passes through zero, 
engages and trips an add pawl I for the next higher denomination, thereby causing one to be added in said denomination. Likewise in subtract operations, when a wheel of the No. I totalizer is rotated reversely to zero, the transfer cam I40 5 therefor engages and trips a subtract transfer pawl I42 to cause one to be subtracted from the next higher denomination. 
 In total and sub-total recording operations, the corresponding wheel of the selected totalizer is 0 engaged with the rack I22 prior to its initial movement rearwardly, which movement rotates said wheel in a reverse direction until said wheel is stopped in zero position by one of the teeth of the transfer cam I40 engaging the inner surface 5 of its add transfer pawl I. This positions the rack I22 and the type carrier 44 commensurate with the amount of the totalizer wheel. The difference between a read and reset or a sub-total and total recording operation is that in read or 20 sub-total operations the wheel of the selected totalizer remains in engagement with the rack I22 during its return movement forwardly and is therefore returned to its former position, and in reset or total operations the wheel of the selected 25 totalizer is disengaged from the rack I22 before said rack starts its return movement forwardly, therebyleaving said wheel standing at zero. 
Rack retaining mechanism end of machine operation; 0 
 At the beginning of each machine operation, the rack-retaining mechanism is moved to ineii'ective position. After the leading frame II1 has completed its initial movement counterclockwise and the rack I22 has been positioned as explained above, the rack retaining mechanism is moved to 45 effective position to relieve the excessive strain on the rack and totalizer transfer mechanism durin return movementof the leading frame I I1. This mechanism will now be described in detail. I 
 Referring to Figs. 12, 18 and 19, each of the racks I22 has on the lower edge thereof a series of ratchet teeth I51 adapted to cooperate with spring pawls I58 secured on a retaining pawl plate I 59 rotatably supported by trunnions I60 in the frames 40 and 4|. Secured to the plate I58 is a cam arm IOI with a roller I62 that is maintained in contact with the periphery of a plate cam I63, secured on the main shaft 53. by a spring I64 which is tensioned to urge the 60 plate I59 in a clockwise direction. 
 At the beginning of a machine operation, the cam I63 rocks the plate I59 counterclockwise to disengage the pawls I58 from the ratchet teeth I51. After the leading frame I I1 has completed 65 its initial movement counterclockwise and the racks I22 have been positioned by means of the transfer cams I40 in cooperation with the transfer pawls I as explained earlier herein for various .total recording operations, the cam I63 returns the plate I59 clockwise to reengage the pawls I55-with the teeth I51. The plate I59 remains in this position throughout the remainder of ,machine operation, return movement of the racks I22 causing the teeth I51 to ratchet over transfer mechanism of the strain caused by the springs I when the actuator racks I22 are stopped early in their initial movement rearward.- ly. This mechanism also insures that the racks are returned fully to zero position at the end of machine operation. 
Amount key locking mechanism Mechanism is provided to lock the amount keys against movement during machine operation. This mechanism is shown in Fig. 20 and includes the following mechanism: 
 Each amount key I21 carries a stud I65 adapted to cooperate with a right-angled upper edge I66 of a plate I61 loose on a rod I68 supported by bars I69, only one here shown, supported by the keyboard frame. The plate I61 has an extension which cooperates with a notch I10 in a bar "I slidably supported in the keyboard frame. The bar I1I carries a stud I12 embraced by the bifurcated upper end of a lever I13 pivoted to the bar I69 and carrying a. roller I14 which cooperates with a cam disk I15 secured on the shaft 53. The plate I61 and connected mechanism is urged clockwise by a torsion spring (not shown) to normally maintain the roller I14 in contact with the face of the cam I15. A node I16 of the cam I15 maintains the plate I61 in ineffective position when the machine is at rest. At the beginning of machine operation, the node I16 moves out of the path of the roller I15, allowing the plate I61 to move clockwise so that the edge I66 moves in the path of the stud I65. 8 
 In case the amount key I21 has not been depressed, the extension I66 moves below the stud I65, blocking downward movement of said amount key. In case the key I21 has been depressed, the extension I66 moves over the stud I65, preventing upward or releasing movement of said amount key. Near the end of machine operation, the node I16 rocks the arm I13 and the plate I61 counterclockwise to ineffective position. A bent-over ear I11 of the lever I13 in cooperation with the top edge of the bar I69 limits the clockwise movement of said lever I13. 
Totalizer selecting and controlling mechanism The adding functions of the different totalizers are controlled by means of control elements located in columnar positions on the traveling carriage in cooperation with hanging bar levers. Thesubtract function of the No. I or balance totalizer is controlled either by control elements on the traveling carriage or by means of a Subtract control key. A Non-add control key is provided to prevent addition in any of the totalizers when it is desired to record an amount or item without having said aount or item entei'ed in a totalizer. The various total recording functions of the instant machine are controlled by means of Total and Sub-total control keys. Adding and'subtracting operations may be repeated by means of a Repeat control key and an Error key is provided to release depressed amount and control keys. 
Inasmuch as the totalizer selecting and con-- trolling mechanism is substantially duplicated for-each totalizer, it is felt that the explanation of this mechanism in connection with one totalizer will be sufllcient. Due to the manner in which the mechanism is illustrated the functioning of the controlling machanism in adding and various total recording operations will be explained in connection with the lower rear or 'bar lever for the balance totalizer. 
No. 4 totalizer and in subtracting operations the controlling mechanism will necessarily be explained in connection with the No. I or balance totalizer. 
Add selecting and controlling mechanism Directing attention to Figs. 21 and 23, secured to the traveling carriage is a bar I18, upon which is adjustably mounted in proper relation to a particular column of the record material one of several control elements I19. The element .I19 has 9. lug I80, adapted to cooperate with an upturned extension I8I of a No. 4 hanging bar lever I82 loose on a stud I83 secured in a machine frame (not shown). The stud I83 also supports the add hanging bar lever for the other three totalizers, as well as the subtract hanging The hanging bar levers have depending slotted projections adapted to cooperate with annular grooves in a stud I84 secured in the tabulating frame. These annular grooves in the stud I84 maintain the hanging bar levers in proper alinement. 
 The lever I82 is connected by a link I85 to an add-control arm I86 loose on a stud I90 in the left frame H. A bent-over ear I81 of the arm I86 cooperates with a tooth I88 on an upward extension of a totalizer engaging pitman I89 the forward end of which is supported in a slotted comb I93 secured to a lever I94 (see also 'Fig. 33) loose on a stud I95 in the frame 4|. 
The lever I94 carries a roller I96 adapted to cooperate with the periphery of a cam I91 secured to the main shaft 53. The rearward end of the pitman I89 is. connected with an arm I98 loose on a stud I99 secured in arear totalizer frame 200. The frame 200 is connected by two plates 20I to a front totalizer frame 202. The lower end of the arm I98 is bifurcated to embrace a stud 203 in an arm 204 secured on a totalizer engaging shaft 205 journaled in the totalizer frame 200. Secured on opposite ends of the shaft 205 are totalizer engaging cams 206 (Fig. 35) having therein slots 201 cooperating with rollers 208 on opposite ends of the No. 4 totalizer shaft. The No. 4 totalizer shaft is supported by a rockable totalizer frame composed of right and left hand end plates 209 (only-the left end plate here shown) and various other auxiliary plates connected by a bail 2I0. The end plates 209 are pivoted on trunnions 2| I, secured in the totalizerframe 200. 
 Referring to Figs. 21, 29 and 31, the pitma'n I 89 has therein a notch 2I2 adapted to cooperate with a-fiattened stud 2I3 in an add control plate 2I4 loose on a stud. 2I5 in the frame H. The plate 2 carries rollers 2I6 and 2I1 cooperating respectively with companion cams 2I8 and 2I9 secured on the main shaft 53. Inadding operations, the shaft 53 makes one clockwise revolution to oscillate the plate 2I4 first V clockwise and then back to normal position. When the traveling carriage is tabulated to a particular column (see also Fig. 23), the projection I80 of the control element I19 engages the extension I8I of the lever I82 to rock said lever clockwise to lift the link I85 to rock the latch I86 clockwise to disengage the ear I81 from the tooth I88 of the pitman I 89. The machine is then released for operation by depressing the starting bar 13. Initial movement of the shaft 53 (Fig. 33) moves the node 220 out of the path of the roller I96, allowing the spring 22I to rock the lever I94 counterclockwise. A spring 222 (Fig. 21) causes the pitman I89 to move in unison with the lever I94 to engage the notch 2 I2 in said pitman with the stud 2I3 in the plate 2. It is obvious that when a totalizer is not selected for addition, the latch I89 prevents the pitman I89 from moving in unison with the lever I94, which makes identical excursions each machine operation, 
 After the racks I22 have completed their initial movement rearwardly to be positioned under control of the amount keys as explained above, the cams 2I8 and 2" (Fig. 21) rock the plate 2I4 clockwise to shift the pitman I89 forwardly, which, by means of the arm I98, rocks the shaft 295 and the cams 299 (Fig. 35) clockwise, which, by means of the slots 291, engages the wheels of the No. 4 totalizer with the extensions I39 of the racks I22. Return movement forwardly of the racks I22 rotates the #4 totalizer wheels commensurate with the valueof the depressed amount keys. After said racks have completed their return movement forwardly, the plate 2I4 is returned counterclockwise to disengage the totalizer wheels from the actuator racks. The lever I94 then returns the pitman I89 upwardly to its normal position. The sequence of movements of the stud 2I3 given above is known the notch 2I2. When the pitman I89 is lowered as explained above, a notch 23I therein is opposite the stud 224. Consequently forward movement of said pitman causes said notch to straddle said stud to prevent accidental disengagement of the pitman I 89 from the stud 2 I3 during machine operation. For a purpose later to be explained, the arm 225 receives movement in sub-total operations, but in all other operations this arm remains stationary. 
Release of amount keys in adding operations In equipping the machine of the instant in-. 
vention with a rotary drive shaft it was necessary to redesign the amount key releasing mechanism. This mechanism is shown in Figs. 2, 24 and 25, and will now be described. 
 Each row of amount keys has a detent 232 loose on a rod 233 supported by the keyboard frame, and urged counterclockwise by a spring (not shown). The lower edge of the detent 232 has an angular lip 234 which latches over a bent-over portion of the lower end of the amount keys I21 to retain said keys depressed. The detent 232 has a projection extending within one of a series of notches 235 ina bar 239 mounted for horizontal sliding movement in' the keyboard frame. 
A bent-over ear 231 of the bar 239 coacts with an extension of a lever 238 pivoted on a bracket 239 secured to the frame 4|. A lefthand extension 2 of the lever 238 extends withon a notch 243 in a release bar 244, the forward end of which is slotted. to embrace a stud 245 in the frame 4 I. The rearward end of the bar 2441s connected to an am 249 (Fig. 2'7) fixedly connected to an arm 241 by a hub which is rotatably supported by isalatch a stud 248inthe frame 4|. 
Pivoted on a stud 249 in the bar 244 259 (Figs. sion spring 251 into communication with a stud 252 in the lever 229. Normally the latch 259 is hooked under the stud 252 and is only disengaged therefrom in repeat operations for a purpose presently to be described. The lever 229 carries a stud 253 urged by a spring 249 into cooperation with the upward extension of a lever 254 loose on a stud 255 inthe frame 4 I. A spring 259 urges the lever 254 clockwise to normally ,maintain a roller 251 carried thereby in contact Control keys and their functions -The functions of thein tant machine, with the exception of adding and subtracting, are controlled by means of a row of control keys 259 situated at the extreme left of the keyboard (Figs. 2, 16, 23 and 24) The undercut upper end of the stems of the control keys protrude through apentures in an auxiliary keyboard plate 299 secured to the frame M. The lower ends of the control keys extend through openings in an angle bar "I secured to the frame 4I. Springs 292 urge the control keys upwardly to normally maintain shoulders thereof in contact with the lower edge Subtract key which selects and conditions the balance totalizer for a subtract operation, a Subtotal" key, which, when used inconjunction with the keys I, 2, 3 and 4, causes the corresponding totalizer to be operated in a sub-total operation, a Non-ad key, depression of which disables all totahzers for addition and which naturally supersedes the add selecting mechanism. 
 Each of the control keys 259, with the exception of the "Repeat key and the Error key, carries a stud 293 adapted to cooperate with symmetrical camming projections on a plate 294 slidably mounted bymeans of slots in said plate in cooperation with studs I99 and 299 in the frame M. The rearward end of the'plate 294 has a downward extension bifurcated to embrace the rounded upper end of an arm 291 secured on a shaft 298 journaled in the frames 49 and 4|. Secured on the righthand end of the shaft 299 (Figs. 2 and carrying one of the studs 293, by means of said stud, shifts the bar 294 forwardly to rock the arm 291, the shaft 299 and arm 299 clockwise as viewed 24 and 28) urged clockwise by a tor of the plate 299. The control keys include an in Figs. 23 and 24. This rocks the latch plate 21I counterclockwise as viewed in Fig. 23 and clockwise as viewed in Fig. 2 to move the step thereon out of the path of the stud 214 to permit 5 releasing movement of the plate 89 when the starting bar 13 is depressed. 
 Releasing-of the machine is likewise controlled by the traveling carriage in tabulated positions thereof by means of a projection on the control element I19 (Fig. 23) in cooperation with a release control hanging bar lever (not shown) but similar to the levers I82. The release control hanging bar lever is operatively connected to the shaft 268, and when said hanging bar lever is en-' gaged by the control element I19, the locking plate 21I is inoved to ineffective position, thus permitting release of the machine. 
Studs 215 (Fig. 24) in the Sub-total key and the Subtract key, in cooperation with the lock- 20 ing plate 216, form an interlock between these keys, preventing the depression of more than one key at a time. Studs 211 in the Nos. I, 2, 3 and 4 Total keys, in cooperation with three locking plates 218, prevent the depression of more than one of these keys at a time. 
Non-add mechanism Each of the totalizer engaging pitmans I89 (Figs. 21 and 24) has a tooth 219 adapted to cooperate with the angular edge 288 of the ball of a yoke 28I the arms of which are loosely supported by the stud I98. The right arm of the yoke 28I has a nose 282 adapted to cooperate with a notch 283 in the Non-add key 259. A spring 284 tensioned between the yoke 28I and a subtotal pawl 285 loose on, a stud 286 in the frame 4I, urges said yoke counterclockwise to cause the nose to enter the notch when the Non-add key is depressed. Counterclockwise movement of the yoke 28I causes the edge 288 to move under the tooth 219 to block downward movement of the pitmans I89. This prevents the pitmans I89 from engaging the stud 2I3 (Fig. 21) in the plate 2 when the arms I86 are rocked to inefiective position by the control element on the traveling carriage to select the totalizers for addition in the 50 229 (Fig. 24) is a link 288, the forward end of which is bifurcated to straddle a stud 289 in an arm 293 pivoted on the stud 266. An angular surface 294 of the arm 293 cooperates with a stud 295 in the Error key 259. A rearward extension 236 of the link 288 cooperates with a stud 291 in the yoke 28I. Clockwise movement of the arm 229, caused by the cam 258 and arm 254 near the end of machine operation, by means of the link 288 rocks the yoke 28I clockwise to disengage the nose thereof from the notch in the Non-add key. The Non-add key is then spring-returned upwardly to normal position. The Non-add key may also be released manually by depressing the error key which by means of the stud 295 rocks the arm 293 clockwise to move the link 288 rearwardly to disengage the nose of the yoke 28I from the notch therein. Rearward movement of the link 288 also rocks the arm 229 clockwise which by means of the latch 258 shifts the release bar 244 rearwardly to provide a means for manually releasing depressed amount keys in the manner set out above. 
Subtract key mechanism The subtract function of the instant machine may be initiated either by means of the traveling carriage in columnar positions thereof or by means of a "Subtract key 259 (Figs. 21, 24, 32 and 34). Depressing the Subtract" key 259, by means of a link 388, rocks an arm 38I loose on the stud I98, clockwise against the tension of a spring 302 to move an ear 383 thereof out of the path of a tooth 384 on an upward extension of a subtract link 385 the forward end.of which is supported in a slot in the comb I93 (Fig. 33). The rearward end of the link 385 is slotted to embrace a stud 386 (Figs. 21 and 30) in an arm 381 loose on a stud 388 in the frame H. An upward extension of the arm 381 is bifurcated to receive a stud-389 in a bell crank 3 I8 secured to a transfer control shaft 3 journaled in the totalizer frame 282. Secured on the shaft 3 is an arm 3I2 connected by a link 3I3 to a transfer segment spring bail 3I4 pivoted within the totalizer frame 282. 
 A rearward extension of the arm 38I (Fig. 32) is bifurcated to receive a stud 3I5 in a latch 3I6 pivoted at 3I1 to the frame 4|. tension of the latch 3I6 terminates in a hook adapted to latch under a stud 3I8 in an arm 3I9 pivoted at 328 to the link 385. The forward end of the arm 3I9 is bifurcated to embrace a stud 32I in a'balance totalizer engaging pitman 322 which is similar in every respect and functions exactly like the pitman I89 for the #4 totalizer illustrated in Fig. 21 and explained above. 
 The pitman 322 is connected'to an arm 323 turnably supported by a stud 324 in the frame M. The upper end of the arm 323 is notched to receive a stud 325 in a crank 326 secured 'to a balance total zer engaging shaft 321 rotatably supported by'the totalizer frame 282. Secured on the shaft 321 are engaging cams 328 which function to engage and disengage the wheels of the balance totalizer with the actuators I22 in exactly the same manner as explained for the cams 286 (Fig. 35) in connection with the No. 4 totalizers. A spring 329 (Fig. 30) urges the link 385 rearwardly to normally maintain a projection 338 thereof against a bushing 348 loose on the stud 388. Clockwise movement of the arm 38I caused by depressing the Subtract key rocks the latch 3I6 counterclockwise to move the hook thereof under the stud 3I8, as shown in Fig. 34. A hanging bar 33I (see also Fig. 23) connec the arm 30I to a subtract hanging bar lever 332, supported by the stud I83. The subtract hanging bar lever cooperates with the control element I19 in exactly the same manner as explained for the add levers I82. Consequently when the traveling carriage is tabulated to certain columnar positions, a lug on the controlelement I19 rocks the lever 332 clockwise to lift the link 33I torock the arm 38I clockwise to accomplish the same result as depressing the Subtract key. Loose on the stud I95 (Fig. 33) is a latch 333 flexibly connected to the lever I94 by a spring 334 which normally maintains a raised surface of said latch in contact with a stud 335 in the lever I94. 
 At the beginning of subtract operations, counter-clockwise movement of the lever I 94 allows the link 385 to be pulled down by aspring in a manner similar to the manner in which spring 222 pulls pitman I89 down, as described above, causing a right angled extension 336 (Figs. 32 and 34) thereof to move into the path of a projection 331 of a totalizer engaging plate 338 loose on the stud 2 I5 and having two rollers 339 which cooperate respectively with the peripheries of companion cams 343 and 344. Downward move- A downward exment of the link 305 to the position shown in Fig. 34 causes the stud -3I8 to cooperate with the hook of the latch 3I6 to rock the arm 3I9 counterclockwise to lift the pitman 322 to engage a notch 345 therein with a flattened stud 346 in the plate 338. counterclockwise movement of the lever I94 and the latch 333, as explained above, moves a bent-over ear 341 of said latch upwardly into the path of a tooth '348 on the link 305, when said link has been lowered in the manner explained above. 
 Prior to initial movement rearwardly of the actuator racks I22, the engaging plate 338 is rocked clockwise by the cams 343 and 344 to shift the link 305 and the pitman 322 forwardly. Forward movement of the link 305 (Figs. 21 and rocks the arm 301 counterclockwise and the bell crank 3I0, and shaft 3 clockwise to move the add trip pawls I (Fig. 12) to ineffective position and to move the subtract trip pawls I42 to effective position. Clockwise movement of the shaft 3 by means of the arm 3I2 and the link 3I3 moves the ball 3 I 4 clockwise to shift the position of the transfer segment springs so that the transfer segments will be moved in a reverse direction to transfer negative amounts from lower to higher denominations. When the link 305 nears the terminus of its forward movement, as fully shown in the United States patent to Perkins et al., No. 1,679,265, which issued on July 31, 1928, the tooth 3'48 ratchets over the ear 341 of the latch 333 to retain said link and connected mechanism in moved position after the plate 338 (Fig. 32) has been returned counterclockwise to normal position. 
 Forward movement of the pitman 322 rocks the arm 323 clockwise to rock the crank 326, the shaft 321 and the engaging plate 328 counterclockwise to engage the wheels of the balance or #I totalizer with the actuators. Initial move: ment rearwardly of the actuator racks rotates the wheels of the balance totalizer in a reverse direction to subtract the value of the depressed amount keys therefrom. After the actuator racks have completed their initial movement, the plate 333 is returned counterclockwise to move the pitman 322 rearwardly to disengage the wheels of the totalizer from said actuators. After the transfer has been completed, return movement of the lever I94 (Figs. 33 and 34) and the latch 333 clockwise disengages the ear 341 from the tooth 348 to allow the link 305 to be returned rearwardly to normal position by the spring 329 (Fig. 30). Return movement of the lever I94 likewise lifts the link 305 to disengage the extension 336 from the projection 331 and to disen- Sage the notch 345 in the pitman 322 from the stud 346, thereby restoring said parts to normal position as shown in Fig. 32. The sequence of movements of the stud 346 to engage the totalizer in a subtract operation is known as "subtract timing". 
 Near the end of a subtract operation the depressed amount keys are released in exactly the same manner as described for adding operations. 
Subtract key releasing mechanism certain times, however, this movement has no connection whatever with the detent 3", said arm serving only as an anchor for said detent. A spring 354 urges the extension 350 into the notch 349 to retain the Subtract key depressed during machine operation. Near the end of machine operation, clockwise movement of the arm 229 causes the stud 253 to engage an upward projection 355 of the detent 35I to return said detent rearwardly to normal position. The 
 Subtract key is then spring-returned upwardly. 
Depressing the Error key 259 (Fig. 24) also rocks the arm 229 clockwise to release the "Subtract key. 
 An interlock is provided between the Subtract key and the #I Total key. Depressing the "Total" key 259 (Figs. 32 and 34) moves a notch 356 therein opposite an extension 351 of a detent 358 the forward end of which has a slot which fits loosely over the stud 245. The rearward end of the detent 358 (Fig. 22) is connected to a stud 359 in a total control lever 360, turnably mounted on the stud 240. The detent 358 is spring-urged forwardly to cause the extension 351 to enter the notch 356 to retain the #I Total key depressed. This also causes a hook 36I of said detent to latch over a stud 362 in the Subtract key 259 to prevent depression thereof. Depressing the Subtract key as illustrated in Fig. 34 moves the stud 362 opposite the nose of the hook 36I to obstruct forward movement of the detent 356 when the #I Total key is depressed. 
Repeat key mechanism Adding and subtracting operations may be re.- peated at the will of the operator. This is accomplished by depressing a "Repeat key 259 (Fig. 24) which causes the amount keys to remain depressed at the end of machine operation to repeat the amount set upon the keyboard in succeeding operations. 
 The Repeat key 259 has anotch 353 adapted to receive a right-angled extension 364 of a repeat detent 365.with a slot which fits loosely over the stud 245. The rearward end of the detent 365 is connected to the stud 342 in the arm 352. 
. with. the stud 351, to lift the nose 368 of said, pawl to rock the latch 250 counterclockwise to disenage it from the stud 252 in the arm 229. This prevents the am 229 from imparting movement to the link 244. Consequently, the depressed amount keys are not released near the end of machine operation and in the succeeding operation the entry of-the amount set up on the keys may be repeated. 
 The Repeat key is normally a stay-down key. However, when this key is depressed in conjunction with one of the totalkeys, it is automatically released at the beginning of the machine operation in a manner later to be described. The Bepeat key may be manually released by means of the Error key 259 (Fig. 24). Depressing the "Error" key causes the roller 295 to engage the rock an arm 369 loose on the stud 266 clockwise. 
The arm 369 in cooperation with a stud 310 in the detent 365 returns said detent rearwardly to disengage the extension 364 from the notch 363, thereby allowing the repeat key to be springreturned upwardly. 
Total-taking control mechanism The total-taking control mechanism is substantially duplicated for each of the four totalizers. It is, therefore felt that an explanation of the total-taking control mechanism in connection with one of the totalizers (No. 4) will be sufilcient for the purpose of this specification. The No'. 4 total taking control mechanism is shown in normal position in Fig. 29 and in moved position in Directing attention to Figs. 21, 29,.and 31. a No. 4 Total key 259 has a notch 3" arranged to receive a right-angled extension 312 of a detent 313, the forward end of which is slotted to fit loosely over the stud 245. The rearward end of the detent 313 is connected to a total control lever 314 loose on the stud 248 and having an angular surface 315 on an upward extension thereof which cooperates with a stud 316 in the #4 engaging pitman I89. A comb 390 secured to the frame 4I (Figs. 23 and 26) has equally spaced slots adapted to receive the No. 4 total detent 313, similar detents for the other three totalizers, the subtract detent 35I and the repeat detent 365 to aline said detents laterally. Depressing the #4 Total key allows a spring 311 to urge the detent 313 forwardly to enter the extension 312 in the notch 31I to retain said key depressed. This forward movement 0 the detent likewise rocksthe lever 314 clockwise causing the angular surface 315 incooperation with the stud 316 to lift the pitman I89 so that a notch 318 therein is moved into engagement with the stud 346 in the engagplate 338. 
 Initial movement clockwise of the plate 338 shifts the pitman I89 forwardly to rock the arm I98 counterclockwise to rock the arm 204, shaft 205 and-engaging cams 206 clockwise to engage the wheels of the #4 totalizer with the extensions I39 (Fig. 12) of the actuator raclm I 22 prior to their initial movement rearwardly. Initial movement rearwardly of the racks and extension turns the wheels of the #4 totalizer to zero and positions the printing segments 44 commensurate with the value on said totalizer wheels. Immediately after the impression is completed "and before the racks I22 start their return movement forwardly, the plate 338 (Fig. 29) is returned counterclockwise to shift the pitman I89 rearwardly to normal position to disengage the totalizer wheels from the actuator racks, thereby leaving said wheels' ment forwardly and accordingly said'wheels are restored to their original condition. The Subtotal key 259 (Figs. 29 and 31) has a stud 319 which extends within a slot in the forward end of a link 380 connected to the stud 2I3 in the engaging plate 2I4. Depression of the Subtotal key moves the link 380 clockwise to latch a notch 38I therein over a stud 382 in the arm 225, as shown in Fig. 31. The Sub-total key is retained depressed by means of a nose 383 (Fig. 24) of the pawl 285, which under tension of the spring 284 enters a notch 384 n said subtotal key. 
In printing a sub-total of the amount on the No. 4 totalizer, the No. 4 TotaPkey, and the Sub-total" key are depressed, and the machine released for operation by depressing the starting bar. Initial movement of the engaging plate 338 moves the pitman I89 forwardly to engage the #4 totalizer wheels with the actuator racks. It will be noted that when the pitman I89 is in its forward position, the stud 316 is out of the path of the upward extension of the lever 314 and the forward edge of said pitman rests on the stud 224 in the lever 225. After the totalizer wheels have been returned to zero and the amount standing on said totalizer wheels has been recorded, initial movement clockwise of the plate 2I4 moves the link 380 forwardly to rock the lever 225 counterclockwise to disengage the stud 224 from the forward edge of the pitman I89. This allows the pitman, assisted by the spring 222, to drop downwardly uhtil the notch 2I2 latches over the stud 2I3, which at this time is alined with said notch. Obviously this disengages the notch 318from the stud 346 and con-. sequently the plate 338 will make its return movement counterclockwise without disengaging the totalizer wheels from their actuators. Return movement of the actuators I22 (Fig. 12) and their associated extensions I39 then rotates the wheels of the #4 totalizer back to their original position, thus effecting a reading or sub-total operation ,involving the #4 totalizen- Clockwise movement 01' the arm 229 (Figs. 24 and 31) effected near the end of machine operation by the cam 258 and the arm 254, or manually by means of the Error key 259 in cooperation with the arm 293 and the link 288, causes the stud 253 to engage an upward extension 385 of the detent 313 to restore said detent and the lever 314 rearwardly to disengage the extension 312 from the notch 31I in the #4 Total key, thereby allowing said key to be spring returned upwardly to normal position. Likewise, rearward movement of the link 288, occasioned by the means related above, causes a downward extension 386 thereof in cooperation witli a stud 381 in the pawl 285 to rock said pawl clockwise to disengage the nose 383 thereof from the notch 384 in the Subtotal key, to allow said key to be spring-returned upwardly. 
 In order to insure that none of the amount keys are depressed during total and sub-total operations, means rendered effective by depression of any of the total keys is provided to release said amount keys at the beginning of totalizing operations. Such mechanism will now be described. 
 By referring to Figs. 2'1, 29 and 31, it will be seen that the detent 313 for the No. 4 Total key has a downward projection 388 which cooperates with a stud 389 in a bell crank 393 loose' on a stud 394 in the frame 4|. of the bell crank 393 is bifurcated to receive a A rearward extension stud 395 in an arm 396 loose on a stud 391 in the arm 241. A spring 398 urges the bell crank 393 counterclockwise to maintain the stud 389 in contact with the projection 388 and to normally maintain the stud 395 out of the path of a nose 399 of an arm 400 loose on the stud 248. The arm 400 carries a roller 40I held in contact with the periphery of a earn 402 secured to the shaft 53, by a spring 403. Depression of the No. 4 Totall key and resulting forward movement of the detent 313 rocks the bell crank 393 clockwise to lift the stud 395 in the path of the nose 399. Clockwise movement of arm 396 is terminated by
