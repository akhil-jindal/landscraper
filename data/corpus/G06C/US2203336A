12 Claims. 
 The present invention relates to computing and recording machine, and it resides in certain improvements, features of construction and combinations and arrangements of parts, all of which will be fully set forth herein and particularly pointed out in the claims. 
 A specific machine embodying the invention is shown in the accompanying drawings and described in this specification, but it will be understood that some of the features shown and described may be modified considerably without departing from the invention. 
 The machine described in detail is a small, light and, therefore, portable adding, subtracting and recording machine, here shown as hand driven but which may be driven by a small electric motor if desired. In general it is of the 10 key class of, the type shown in United States Patent #1,899,444 to Thomas O. Mehan, wherein the keys set stops in a travelling stop carriage. While the present invention may be readily embodied in said machine with but slight changes in the existing structural features thereof, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in other forms of computing machines, wherever found available. Two sets of register wheels in permanent mesh with each other are mounted in a cradle which is adapted to be revolved 180 for the purpose of bringing one set of wheels into engagement with the actuating racks for addition, and the other set of wheels into engagement with the same actuating racks for subtraction. Provision is made for positive and negative computation, the correct balance being automatically printed whether positive or negative. The transfer mechanismis of novel construction and contains provisions for precision and certainty of operation. The means for controlling the engagement and disengagement of the register in different sequences for different operations is novel and effective. 
 The machine may contain control keys for subtraction, total, subtotal, non-add and repeat, the last capable of giving multiplication rapidly. It also contains numerous interlocks and other safe guarding devices. 
 The invention has for its object to produce an improved computing machine in respect of the matters above indicated and of others which will be apparent from the following description.

General construction The particular machine shown in the drawings is similar in most respects and is identical in its general organization and principle with that described in the above mentioned Mehan patent, which machine has for sometime been known commercially as the Monarch or Remington adding and listing machine; but in order to make room for the direct subtraction mechanism the machine has been somewhat enlarged. 
 The machine comprises the usual ten numeral keys [0, Fig. 1, the stems ll of which are adapted to set stops l2 in a step by step moving stop carriage 13, which carriage travels on rails l4 and i5 under the control of an escapement which ispartially shown in Fig. 1 and designated IS. The escapement mechanism for controlling the movement of the stop carriage l3 may be the same as that disclosed in the above mentioned Mehan Patent 1,899,444. In a few details of construction, the escapement mechanism shown herein differs slightly from that shown by Mehan so that this portion of the machine will be briefly described. As shown in Fig. 24 the stop carriage i3 is urged towards the left of the machine by a spring I which acts upon the carriage through an intermediate connection consisting of an arm 2 and a link 3 connected to a plate I3A fast on the carriage 13. The upper end of the plate I3A is bent forwardly and is formed as a toothed rack 4 which cooperates with the well-known escapement controlling devices to limit the leftward movement of the carriage to one step upon each operation of a numeral key i0. Normally resting directly in front of one of the teeth on rack 4 is a pawl 5 pivotally mounted on the left-hand end of a lever 6 supported at its right-hand end, by a fixed bracket 6A. A spring 1 is provided to urge the lever 6 in a clockwise direction while another spring 5A, connecting the pawl 5 and the lever 6, serves to press the pawl in a counterclockwise direction into engagement with a bent over ear formed on the lever 6. A link 8 connects the lever 6 to a bail assembly comprising two arms 9 (one shown) and a connecting rod 9A. The stems H of the numeral keys in are formed with shoulders which overlie the rod 9A so that each time a numeral key is depressed the bail assembly comprising arms 9 and rod 9A is rocked downward in a clockwise direction. Through the link 8 this motion is imparted to the lever 6, causing the lever to move a short distance in a counter-clockwise direction. This motion of the lever 6 serves to move the pawl 5 downward out of engagement with the rack 4 whereupon the rack is permitted to move leftwardly until the tooth thereon which was previously engaged by the pawl comes to rest against the bent-over ear on lever B and over the nose of the pawl 5. This is not a full step of movement of the rock and the full step is not completed until the depressed numeral key is released. When this is done, the lever B and the bail assembly 9-9A rise to their normal positions thus moving the ear on lever 6 out of engagement with the tooth of the escapement rack 4. Since the pawl 5, at this time, underlies the rack tooth which it previously held engaged it is prevented from moving upward with the lever 6 so that the stop carriage i3 is free to travel leftward. Leftward movement of the rack 4 frees the pawl 5 allowing it to snap back to its original position where it engages the next succeeding tooth of the rack and holds the stop carriage in its new position. This escapement mechanism is basically the same as that disclosed in the cited Mehan patent and for a more detailed disclosure of this and other mechanisms pertaining to the pin carriage I3 reference may be made to that patent. The stops l2 when set are adapted to arrest ears I! on slides l8 which latter are mounted by pin and slot connections 20 (see Fig. 1) on the usual horizontally movable differential slides 21. The slides I8 and 2! are connected as usual by a spring 22 for the purpose of transfer and these slides are urged towards the rear of the machine by actuating springs 23. The slides 2| have their rear parts offset upward as usual and guided by a comb bar 24. Rack teeth on these bars mesh with pinions 25 which also mesh with vertical rack teeth on the type carriers 26 having slideable type 2'! for cooperation with platen 28. 
 The framework of the machine comprises a base casting 30, here shown so shaped as to tilt the rear end of the machine up somewhat, which is sometimes convenient in operation and which also serves to furnish room for a motor at the rear of the machine if desired. The mechanism is mostly supported on an inner frame comprising frame plates 3i and 32, Figs. 10 and 21, having ears which are screwed to the base plate and said upright plates 3| and 32 being united by various cross members. At some distance outside of these plates there are also a left hand vertical frame plate 33 and a right hand plate 34, these being mainly for supporting controls, etc. The slides 2|, type bars 26 and the computing mechanism are mounted between the plates 3| and 32. 
Register The register mechanism, shown in Figs. 1, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. comprises in each denomination two register wheels 35 and 36 in constant mesh, the former journaled on a shaft 31 and the latter on a shaft 38. In adding operations the wheels 35 mesh with rack teeth 40 on the slides 2| as shown, for example, in Figs. 1 and 6, and in subtracting operations the wheels 36 mesh with said racks (Fig. '7) and we may, therefore. refer to the wheels'35 and 36 as the adding wheels and the subtracting wheels, respectively. 
 The shafts 31 and 38 are rigidly mounted in a register frame consisting of two end plates 4| secured together by two frame rods or bars 42. Trunnions 43, Figs. 5 and 21, projecting from the plates 4| are journaled in side-arms 44 and 45 of a cradle which also comprises a rock shaft 46 to which the arms 44 and 45 are rigidly secured. Said cradle is stiffened by a cross bar 41. The shaft 46 is journaled in the frame plates 3| and 32, and it is by a rocking of this cradle that the register wheels are moved into and out of mesh with the racks. 
 The manner in which the register cradle is pivoted is shown in Figs. 5 and 21. Each of the plates 31 and 32 has a notch or open slot into which the shaft 46 is inserted from the front and a clip 48 is secured to each of the plates 3| and 32 by a screw 50 and extruded pin 5i, said clip closing the open end of the slot. The construction is such that the cradle and the entire register assembly can he removed from the machine bodily by merely loosening these two screws 58 and removing the clips. 
Register engaging and disengaging mechanism The operating mechanism comprises the usual main rock shaft 52, which carries certain cams and other operating devices, which shaft may be rocked by any suitable means such as a handle or motor. The means for moving the register into and out of mesh with the racks is best shown in Figs. 5 and 18 which are views of the mechanism as seen from the left and with the outside frame plate 33 removed. Pivoted at 53 to the left hand arm 44 of the register cradle is a platelike link 54 of special shape, somewhat like an inverted Y- The crotch at the lower end of this link comprises two shallow slots 55 and 56 for the reception of pins 51 and 58 projecting rightward (Fig. 18) from a plate 60 pivoted on a stud 6| projecting from an offset arm 62 of the left hand frame plate 3i. Said plate 61.- carries on its left hand face two pins 83 and 64 which project through suitable openings in a bracket 65 secured to the base casting of the machine and which bracket also helps to support the stud Bl. The end crotch or notch of the link 54 is of a sort of diamond shape as shown in Fig. 5 so as to form cam edges which cooperate with the pins 51 and 58 to guide the latter into the notches or slots 55 and 56. The link is normally held by a certain spring, to be hereinafter described, in its forward position with the pin 58 in the notch 56 so that if the plate 60 be rocked clockwise in Fig. 5 the register wheels will be lifted out Of mesh With the racks on slides 2|. Such rocking of the plate 60 is normally effected by a wipe pawl 66 of the general type usual in these machines, said pawl being pivoted to an arm 69 rigidly projecting from the main shaft. Said wipe pawl has a project ing finger 51 and two shoulders, one, 68, for cooperation with the pin 64 and another, 10, for cooperation with the pin 63. The pawl is infiuenced by the usual spring 11 but it is normally rocked clockwise against said spring by the action of a branch 12 thereof on a stud 13 projecting from the bracket 65. On the forward (clockwise) stroke of the shaft 52 as the arm 69 descends and the branch or finger 12 moves away from the stud 13 the wipe pawl swings counterclockwise and the shoulder 68 acting on pin 64 rocks plate 60 and forces the register cradle upward to disengaging position, all in the first part of the stroke. After this the pawl 66 automatically reverses by wiping over the pin 63 and at the first part of the return stroke the shoulder 10 acting on said pin rotates the plate 60 counter clockwise and draws the register wheels into mesh. In order to take totals the plate link 54 is swung clockwise, Fig. 5, whereupon the pin 51 will be cammed into the notch 55 and pin 64 will be swung to a position where it will not be further moved by the pawl 66 on the forward stroke but the pin 63 will be engaged at the beginning of the return stroke and rock the plate 60 counter clockwise. As the pin 51 is at the right of the pivot of said plate this motion will swing the register wheels out of mesh at the beginning of the return stroke. This mechanism is only briefly described because it is of a familiar type. The means for swinging the plate 54 to its different positions will be described hereinafter. 
 As best shown in Fig. 5 the arm 44 of the register cradle terminates in a V tooth 14 coperating with a detent lever 15 pivoted on a stud 16 projecting from the frame plate 3|, said detent being drawn into engagement with tooth 14 by a spring 11. The detent is made yoke shaped as shown so as to afford a long bearing on the stud 16. Its V-shaped tooth 18 serves yieldingly to hold the cradle in either of its two positions. The motion of said cradle downward is limited by the cross bar 41 striking the top edges of the frame plates 3| and 32. In order to provide for adjustment this frame bar has eccentric trunnions projecting therefrom through the arms 44 and 45 so that it can be adjusted by rotating it and it can be secured in its adjusted position by tightening the screw 80, Fig. 5, which is threaded into the end of the bar. The motion of the cradle in the upward direction is limited by one of its arms striking a washer or roller 8| conveniently mounted on the cross rod 82. Adjustment in this instance is afforded by the provision of washers of different diameters, a suitable one being selected in each instance. 
 It is desirable that in the course of the forward stroke and also of the return stroke of the main shaft the register be positively held in its upper or lower position as the case may be, and this is effected by positively locking the detent 15. To this end said detent has a rearwardly projecting arm 83 having a stud on which is mounted a roller 84. Fast to the main shaft 52 is a plate or cam 85 having a concentric edge 86 which is so situated that it passes under the roller 84 in the early part of the forward stroke of the shaft after the shifting mechanism above described has finished its operation. If the register cradle has not been firmly set against its limit stop this concentric edge acting on the roller 84 will force the detent into snug locking position and force the register cradle into accurate position. It is especially desirable that said cradle be firmly and accurately positioned at the end of the forward stroke and yet it must be promptly released at the very beginning of the return stroke in order that the cradle may be shifted at that time. This condition is brought about as follows: The concentric edge 86 is comparatively short and soon passes out from under the roller 84. A member 81 is pivotally mounted on the shaft 52 by the side of the plate 85 and is permitted a limited rocking motion relative to said plate by a stud 38 projecting from the said plate 85 into a concentric slot 98 in the plate 81. The latter plate is operatively connected with the plate 85 by by means of a friction spring not shown. Said plate 81 has a finger 9| including a shoulder 92 which latter as the parts swing towards the right, in Fig. 5, passes under a nose 93 on the arm 83 and positively locks said arm against downward motion, at the same time arresting the rocking motion of the plate 81 and forcing the plate 85 to finish its swing, leaving the plate 81 stationary. At the beginning of the return stroke, however, the shoulder 92 immediately moves from under the nose 93 leaving the register frame free to be shifted. The counter-clockwise motion of the plate 81, is, however, presently arrested by a finger 94 thereof engaging a hub on the stud 16. There is thus left an interval after the shoulder 92 leaves the nose 93 when the detent 15 is free to be snapped counter-clockwise and back immediately following which the concentric edge 86 again passes under the roller 84 and assures that the detent I5 is snugly positioned. 
Register reversing mechanism When setting the machine for subtraction the register frame 4|, etc., is rocked through 180 from the adding position shown in Fig. 10 to the subtracting position shown in Fig. 11. This has the advantage that the subtract wheels engage the same tooth of the rack 40 as the add wheels, which considerably simplifies the problem of transfer. This must obviously be done in the course of the forward stroke of the operating shaft after the register has been lifted out of mesh and before it is again thrown into mesh at the beginning of the return stroke. As shown in Fig. 10 each of the end plates 4| of the cradle has two notches diametrically opposite each other and lying between two projecting ears or lugs 99 and 99A of the plate. In each instance one of these projecting lugs 99 is longer than the other (99A) and when the register is in its upper position the longer lugs 99 are adapted to be arrested by respective flanges 96 projecting from little brackets fastened to the plates 3I and 32. With the parts in adding position, shown in Fig. 10, when the cradle swings down about the shaft 46 the lower slot 95 will embrace this flange and accurately position the register frame. To set the machine for subtraction said frame is rotated clockwise from the position in Fig. 10 to that in Fig. 11 and on the subsequent depression of the register the other slot 95 will accurately position the parts. In order to rotate the register frame as above mentioned, the right hand one of the trunnions 43 is prolonged beyond the arm 45 (Fig. 21) and has mounted thereon a pinion 91. When the register is lifted out of mesh this pinion (Fig. 4) engages an internal segmental rack 98 which is secured to the end of an arm I00 which arm is pivoted at its lower end to a U shaped bracket IOI secured to the base casting 30. As here shown the T-shaped arm I00 is made with two holes into which project extrusions I02 forced out of the rack 98 which latter is secured in position by a screw I03, the extrusions locating the rack with precision. By this construction the rack can be removed by simply removing the one screw I03. 
 When the register wheels are in mesh with their racks 40 the pinion 9! is out of mesh with its rack 98 and it is important that the latter be not accidently displaced from its end position during this time as otherwise the pinion 91 would move into engagement with the wrong tooth of said rack. To this end the arm I00 has a lug or flange I04 secured to its left hand face in such a position that when the pinion 91 is out of mesh, said flange stands opposite a hub or collar on the trunnion on which this pinion is mounted and prevents rocking of the arm I00 and it will do this in either extreme position of said arm, the flange in one instance being in front of said trunnion and in the other instance being behind it. When the pinion moves up into mesh as shown in Fig. 4 this flange comes beneath the collar on the trunnion and not only permits the arm to swing but also during such swinging positively holds the pinion in engagement. The arm I00 is influenced in its movements by a detent arm I05 pivoted on a stud I06 projecting from the frame plate 32. Said detent has a V-shaped tooth I01 which by means of a spring I08 is pressed into engagement with a roller IIO on the arm I00. 
The spring I08 is sufficiently strong so that when the roller II 0 passes the apex of tooth IO'I said spring tends to cause the arm to complete its motion with a snap. The motion of the arm is limited in each direction by a collar or roller I II on the detent arm there being two such collars, one in front of and the other behind said arm. 
 In the present machine the mechanism is set for subtraction in computing operations under the control of a subtract key, and on a blank stroke preparatory to total-taking it is also sometimes set for subtraction under the control of certain mechanism due to the fact that the register indicates a negative balance; and in computing operations the mechanism is automatically returned to adding condition upon the restoration of the subtract key and also sometimes on a blank stroke preparatory to totaltaking due to the register indicating a positive total. In any of these events the arm I00 is actuated by a slide II2 having suitable slots by which it is guided for front and rear sliding motion, one of said slots being guided by the main shaft 52 and the other by a frame rod H3. The slide H2 is operatively connected with the arm I00 by pin and slot. 
 In order to operate the subtract slide 2 in one direction or the other as required during the proper part of the forward stroke of the main shaft said slide has a vertically slideable piece I I4 mounted thereon by pin and slot connections II5, Figs. 2, 4 and 14, said piece H4 having formed thereon two ears H6 and III. In adding operations the slide H4 occupies its lower position, shown in Fig. 2, and in that position the ear H6 lies in the path of a stud H8 on a main actuating cam 203 fast on the main shaft 52 so that on the forward stroke of said shaft and cam said stud will force the slide II2 to its forward position carrying with it the arm I00 and setting the mechanism for addition. In this position the ear III is beneath the path of another stud I2I fast on the cam 203. In order to set the machine for subtraction the slide H4 is moved to its upper position shown in Fig. 3 in which the ear I I6 is out of the path of the stud I I8 and the ear III is in the path of the stud IZI which stud being below the shaft 52 moves rearwardly during the forward stroke of said shaft and carries with it the slides H4 and H2 setting these to their rear positions and setting the register mechanism for subtraction, as shown in Fig. 4, which figure represents the position of the parts at the end of the forward stroke of the main shaft. It will be understood that the register will be dropped into mesh with the racks at the first part of the return stroke of the shaft. The slide H2 and arm I00 will remain in the position shown in Fig. 4 as long as the machine is set for subtraction. 
 The control slide H4 is set to its two positions by a lever I22 having astud I23 playing in a horizontal slot I24 in the slide II4, said lever being pivoted on the subtraction shaft I25. 
 As best shown in Fig. 9 this lever I22 is one arm of a bail, the bar I26 of which extends across the machine to the left hand side thereof and is integral with a depending arm I21 which is also pivoted on the shaft I25. 
Subtract key The subtract key I30 is connected with the lever I22 in amanner which will now be described, Figs. 3, 4 and 14-17. The stem of said key is guided in a slot of the top plate I3I of the keyboard and is pivoted to a key lever I32 of peculiar construction. As shown in Fig. 14 this key lever is made of a piece of sheet metal formed or bent into two vertical planes connected by a yoke bar I33, the key I30 being pivoted on the left hand one of these vertical portions. The right hand arm of the key lever is rigidly secured to the shaft I25 so as to cause said shaft to rock with the lever and this right hand portion of the lever is prolonged downwardly and rearwardly into an arm I34, the free end of which has a tongue I35 formed off therefrom to the left of the general plane of the arm. On the main shaft 52 there is mounted a disc I36 having an arcuate flange I31 normally terminating just above the tongue I35. The construction is such that with the subtract key in the inactive position, shown in Fig. 14, if said main shaft be rocked the flange I31 will move in behind the tongue I35 and prevent depression of the subtract key until the completion of the cycle. If, however, the subtract key be first depressed, as shown in Fig. 15, and the main shaft be then actuated the tongue I35 will be behind the flange I31 and the subtract key will be positively held in its depressed position until the end of the cycle. Also if the subtract key be only partially depressed the tongue I35 will be in the path of the flange I31 and the main shaft will be locked against operation. 
 Referring to Fig. 4, the arm I22 rests on an ear I38 bent off from a lever I40 pivoted on the shaft I25, at two points connected by a yoke piece MI. The lever I40 lies to the left of the key lever I32 and between said lever and the lever I22 and it has a stud I42 projecting through a slot I43 in the key lever I32 which slot is of a width greater than the diameter of the stud. The stud is normally held against the upper edge of the slot by a spring I44 connected to a stud I45 on the key lever I32, as shown in Fig. 14. The lever I40, Figs. 3 and 4, is extended towards the front of the machine for a purpose to be hereinafter referred to. The lever I22 is prolonged rearwardly so as to limit on a collar on the stud I06 hereinbefore referred to, as shown in Fig. 4, so that in case the subtract key is down the spring I44 can yield without putting any binding friction on the stud I23 and slot I24. 
 In order to latch the key I30 in its depressed position an arm I46, fast on the left hand end of the shaft I25 as shown in Figs. 14-16, has an ear cooperating with a latch I41 pivoted on a fixed stud I48 and drawn upward by a spring I50. The parts are shown in normal position in Fig. 14 and the key I30 in its ordinary depressed position in Fig. 15, where it will be held by the latch I41. In order to release this latch its sloping upper edge cooperates with a stud I5I projecting from a release slide I52 mounted on fixed studs I48 and I53 on the left hand frame plate 3|. At its rear end this slide carries a follower roller I54 riding in a cam slot I55 in a cam disc I56 fast on the main shaft 52. This cam is concentric throughout most of its length but at its forward end it inclines inward towards the center of the shaft. The construction is such that soon after the shaft 52 begins to turn the slide I52 will be moved towards the front of the machine and release the latch as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 15. By this time, however, the flange I31 will have moved in front of the tongue I35 so that the key will be held down until the end of the cycle when it will be automatically returned to normal position by a spring I51, Fig. 14 acting on the arm I34. 
 Provision is made for locking the key I30 down in such a way that it will remain down for a succession of subtracting operations until released by hand. To this end the stem of the key is made with a notch I58 which can be caught under the keyboard plate I3I by pressing the key down an extra distance and pushing it rearward with the finger, as shown in Fig. 16. In this operation the spring I44 is further stretched. 
 It is desirable to have the spring I44 interposed between key I30 and the lever I40 so that the key can be pushed down and the arm I22 accurately positioned without the necessity of great precision in the depth to which the key is held by the latch I41 but it is also desirable that when the key reaches the ordinary end of its stroke, as shown in Fig. 15, the finger of the operator encounters sufficient resistance so that he will not unintentionally push the key on down to its permanent set position. To this end an extra piece I60, Fig. 17, is inserted which piece has the yoke form shown and is pivoted on the shaft I25 between the two arms of the lever I32. The right hand arm of this piece I60 is connected with a stud I62 on the key lever I32 by a spring I6I much stifi'er than the spring I44. The left hand arm of the piece I60 has a shoulder I63 that normally limits on an adjustment roller I64 mounted on the spring stud I45 which shoulder normally takes the tension of the spring I6I which, therefore, ordinarily is idle. The left hand branch of the piece I60 also has an arm I65 projecting under the stud I 42 and normally at a higher level than the bottom edge of the slot I43 in the lever I32, but out of contact with the stud. The construction is such that when the key is depressed by the usual light tap, the arm I 22 is arrested at I06, the spring I44 yields slightly until the key is arrested by the arm I65 striking the stud I 42, further motion being resisted by the stiff spring I6I. This will arrest any ordinary tap on the key but will permit the key to be depressed to the Fig. 16 position by the exertion of suflicient force to stretch said spring. This key depression is positively arrested by the lower finger of the key lever I32 striking the stud I42. Said finger may be adjusted by bending it. 
Register wheel detent mechanism Some details of the registering mechanism remain to be described. In order to retain the register wheels accurately and positively in position when out of mesh with the racks 40 two detents or locking plates I66 and I61, Figs. 10, 11, 13 and 21, are provided, each made with trunnions I68 by which it is pivoted in the end plates M of the register frame, these locking plates being provided with a series of teeth, one for each register wheel. The plate I66 engages the add pinions 35 and the plate I61 the subtract pinions 36. These plates may be mere detents, but in the present instance the plate I61 is so positioned that it acts on the teeth of the pinion 36 like a pawl, one of said teeth contacting with the end of the detent so as positively to prevent clockwise rotation of the pinion. The detent I66 is likewise so disposed that it engages the teeth of each pinion 35 after the fashion of a pawl, positively preventing clockwise rotation of those pinions. As counter clockwise rotation of one pinion involves clockwise rotation of the other, it will be seen that the pinions are positively locked against rotation in both directions. Meanwhile, each detent is spring pressed towards the pinion and acts on one tooth of the pinion by spring pressure tending to rotate the pinion counter clockwise until positively arrested by the end of the detent. It will be seen that these two pawls spring pressed against the wheels tend to rotate the wheels into exact position and positively lock them in such position. 
 Against the left hand plate M the two detents are connected by a link I10, said link pivoted to trunnion-like projections on the ends of the detent plates which projections extend on through slots I1I in the end plates 4I (see Figs. 6 and 13) so as to limit the extent of rotation of the detents. This link I10 is influenced by a spring I12 attached to a stud I13 on the plate M and tending to press the detents into engagement with the wheels. 
 In order to release the detents when the wheels are moved into engagement the following devices are provided, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11: A stud I14 projects from an arm of the left hand cradle arm 44 into a slot in a lever arm I15, which is one branch of a bail shaped piece pivoted on a stud I16 projecting from the left hand frame plate 3I. The other branch of this bail shaped member is prolonged into an arm I11 which is in position to engage a tail or arm I18 projecting from which ever one of the two detent plates I66-I61 happens to be at the rear side of the assembly at the time. When the parts are in adding position, as shown in Fig. 10, the tail I18 of the detent I61 is in this position and when the parts are in the subtract position, shown in Fig. 11, it is the corresponding part of the detent I66. The construction is such that when the cradle frame 43, 44 is depressed to engage the register wheels the arm I 11 rocks counter clockwise and swings the detents out of engagement, as shown in Fig. 1. The proportions of the parts are such that the motion of the arm I 11 is somewhat rapid as compared to that of the cradle frame and there is lost motion between said arm and the tail I18 so that the detents are not released until the register wheels are sufiiciently engaged with the racks and on the up stroke of the cradle the detents are thrown in before register wheels are free of the racks. 
 Preferably there is in the right hand end of the register frame another slide corresponding to the slide I10 and which in Fig. 13 is lettered I80. The associated parts are lettered similarly to Fig. 10, the slide I being in most respects similar to the slide I10. It will be recalled that when the register frame is shifted from adding to subtracting position the detent I05, Figs. 3 and 4, by its inclined tooth or nose I01 tends to complete the semi-rotation of the register frame with something of a snap under spring pressure. In this case the frame is arrested by the ear 99 striking the flange 96. The parts are thus arrested with something of a blow which would tend to throw the detents I66 and I61 momentarily out of engagement. In order positively to prevent this, the slide I 80 is made with an extension I8I from which an ear I82 is bent off. On the frame 32 there is mounted a bracket I83 having a nose or tooth I84 projecting rearward therefrom in such position that when the rotation of the register is arrested in subtract position, this nose stands directly in front of the ear I82 and positively prevents the slide I80 from forward motion and, therefore, prevents the detents from being jarred loose. When the register frame is depressed to bring the register wheels into engagement with the racks the ear I 82 moves to a position below the nose I84, as shown in Fig. 13, so that the detents are free to be released by the arm I11. When the register frame is rotated it is in its upper position, where the nose I84 stands directly in front of the ear I82. When the register frame is rotated from subtract to add position it is again arrested with a blow, but in this direction the momentum tends to press the detents against the wheels. 
Transfer mechanism The transfer mechanism employed in the present machine to transfer from one wheel to the next one of higher order includes transfer pawls I19 (Fig. 12) essentially similar to those heretoforce used in this machine. The drawings show two modified pawls, one, I85 (Figs. 6, 7 and 9) for controlling the wheel of lowest order and another, I86 (Fig. 9) controlled by the wheel of highest order. These pawls are pivoted on a transverse shaft I81 and are drawn upward by springs I88, each against the end of a detent I90, Fig. 6, said detent being urged counter clockwise by the spring I88. At its free end each of these pawls except pawl I85 has a cam tooth I9I adapted when a register wheel 35 pases from 9 to 0 or a register wheel 36 passes from 0 to 9 to be depressed by the carry or transfer tooth I92, Fig. 6, of which each register wheel carries one at the left of its gear teeth. These transfer teeth project radially beyond the gear teeth as shown. When one of the transfer pawls is depressed by a transfer tooth to the position shown in Fig. 8 the detent I90 snaps over the cooperating lug I93 of the pawl and retains it in depressed position until released at a later period in the cycle. When the pawl is in its upper position a finger I94 thereof arrests a flange I95 secured to the right hand side of the next higher rack 2I arresting said rack one unit short of the point to which the slide I8 on said rack is restored. When the pawl is in its lower position, shown in Fig. 8, this flange I95 and the rack to which it is attached can move an extra unit distance until arrested by the end I96 of the notch above the finger I94. This is substantially the ordinary transfer mechanism of this machine. 
 In the present case the transfer mechanism has been modified in a manner that permits of more rapid operation by motor than heretofore. The slides I8 and 2I are restored to their normal forward positions by a bail bar I91. This bail bar, as best shown in Fig. 1, is secured to two arms I98 having the effect of links pivoted at 200 to arms 20I rigidly mounted on a shaft 202, said arms and shaft being rocked at the appropriate time by the cam 203 on shaft 52, Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. l the left hand arm 20I is shown. The right hand arm is not shown in the drawings, but referring to Figs. 3 and 4 it lies between the cam 203 and the inner right hand frame plate 32, and it has a roller 204, shown only in dot and dash lines, and playing in a slot 205 in the cam 203. It will be noted that this slot is first concentric to allow time for other operations on the forward stroke of the main shaft and that the slot then inclines towards the center of the shaft to draw the bail bar I91 towards the rear of the machine, the last end of the slot constituting a short dwell. All this mechanism has been only indicated in the drawings because it is of familiar construction. 
Register wheel actuating mechanism In the machine as heretofore constructed the ears I1 projected from the slides 2| themselves, the slide corresponding to the slide l8, being merely a device for direct cooperation with the restoring bail I91 and connected with the main slide 2| by a spring corresponding to the spring 22. It was found that in very rapid operation when the ear ll had been arrested by one of the stops l2 and the slides were restored by bar I91 that the spring 22 would be stretched and the slide 2| would lag behind the slide |8 with the result that at the instant when the bar I97 had reached its return position the ear I! had not yet quite been restored. Meanwhile the mechanism had begun the return motion of the stop carriage l3, which carriage has among other things the usual flange stop plate 206, Fig. 1, arranged at the left of the set of stops to prevent operation of those differential slides of orders higher than any in the number being added at the moment. If any slide 2| was a little sluggish in returning due to the stretching of the spring 22 its ear I1 occasionally, in very rapid motor operation, was caught in the path of the returning flange 20B and disarranged the operation of the machine. In order to prevent this trouble and thereby to adapt the machine for more rapid operation than heretofore, this ear I! has been put on the slide l8 itself which is prolonged forward for the purpose and the ear is, therefore, positively restored to normal position at the proper time. This change made it necessary to provide against another possible misoperation due to speed. On the rearward stroke of these differential slides the spring 22 relaxes so that theoretically in the first part of the rearward stroke the slide I8 moves relative to the slide 2| 2. distance of one tooth space. As a result, in case of rapid operation, when the ear H is arrested by one of the stops i2, the slide 2| may move on rearward by momentum, momentarily stretching the spring 22. There may, therefore, be a little vibration of the rack bar 2| before it settles into its proper position. This would do no harm except in the case of the highest digits, especially 9. Almost immediately after the slide l8 reaches the 9 position the register is depressed into engagement with the racks, and if at that time the rack was in vibration a misoperation might result. In order to prevent this the following construction has been adopted: The spring 23 is attached to a depending arm of the slide it itself so that once the ear I! is arrested by a stop a moment of force is created tending to rock the rear end of slide l8 upward. The slot 201 in the rear end of said slide, which cooperates with a stud 20 on slide 2|, has been widened at its forward end so as to permit of such a rising action; and the rear end of said slide has been prolonged upward forming a shouldered lug 208 which normally lies under a fiat piece 2|0 of sheet metal riveted to the side of the bar 2|. The construction is such that when the bar I91 starts rearward the tension of the spring 22 will cause the slide l8 to move rearward one step independently of the slide 2|, bringing the lug 208 into such a position that its forward edge is back of the rear edge of the plate 2M; and the rotating tendency of the spring 23 acts to lift the rear end of the slide It so that the forward edge of the lug 208 is raised into locking engagement with the rear edge of the plate 2|0 and the two bars l8 and 2| are for the moment positively locked together and the overthrow of the rack 2| by momentum is positively prevented. 
 It is, of course, necessary on the return stroke of the parts to release the locking engagement between the two plates. To that end the lower rear part of the slide I8 is prolonged rearward making an inclined edge 2 which, as shown in Fig. 1, is the part that is directly engaged by the bar I91, the effect being said bar has a camming action on the slide l8 to depress it out of engagement with the plate 2|0 and allow the parts to be restored to the normal position shown in Fig. 1. However, the engagement of the bar I91 with the inclined edge 2|| might tend to prevent the interlocking action desired. It will be recalled that the overthrow of the bar 2| is injurious only in the latter part of the stroke. The guide slots 2|2 in which the bar |91 travels are, therefore, made of, the shape shown in Fig. 1, its forward end being at a sufficiently low level to cause the bar I91 to engage the incline 2| I but the rear part of the slot being at a higher level so as to move said bar upward to engage the vertical rear edges of the slides l8 so as not to interfere with their upward interlocking motion. 
 The above described differential mechanism is claimed in applicant's copending application S. N. 73,020, filed April 6, 1936. 
Zero stop In the machine as heretofore constructed totals have been taken by having the transfer tooth I92 arrested on the rearward stroke of the bar 2| by the abrupt forward edge of, the lug |9| of the transfer pawl. This is a practical method of taking the total, but it requires a high degree of precision in the mechanism. When the wheel stands at zero and is moved down into the rack, the transfer tooth I92 moves down just in front of the abrupt face of the lug |9| of. the pawl. Unless there is sufiicient clearance between the tooth and lug, a slight error in the position of the wheel would cause the tooth during such motion to strike on top of the lug and trip the transfer pawl and cause an erroneous transfer. It is common practice to leave between the tooth and lug, when the wheels are in engagement, 2. theoretical clearance of about .010 of an inch. An error of. a little more than that in the setting of the register wheels would, therefore, cause an erroneous transfer. Where two wheels in mesh are provided, the liability to error in the positioning of the wheels is increased. The machine would be much more reliable if the clearance between the tooth and the lug was made materially greater than .010. However, if this were done then in taking a total the rack 2| would have to move forward beyond its proper position an amount equal to the amount of the clearance and the total would, therefore, be printed that much above the ordinary line of printing. In the particular machine described in the drawings this clearance has been increased to about .040, thus entirely eliminating the danger of. error above mentioned; and in taking totals the wheels are not arrested by the transfer pawls at all but are arrested by a separate device. The means for arresting the register wheels at zero in totaltaking comprises a bar 2 I3, Figs. 1, and 18, said bar having a series of teeth 2 M on its lower edge for engagement with the transfer teeth I92 but out of the planes of the gear teeth. This plate is in effect a bail bar, the arms 2|5 of the bail being pivoted to the arms 44 and 45 of the cradle on pivot screws 2H5. The left hand one of these arms 2I5 has a radial slot into which a stud 2! 1 projects from an arm of the plate link 54 which regulates the engagement and disengagement of the register. The construction is such that when said link 54 is in its forward or computing position, shown in Fig. 5, the bar 2I3 is held up in the position shown in Figs. 1 and 5 out of engagement with the register wheels; but when the link 54 is swung to its rear position for the purpose of taking a total the bar 2I3 is rocked downward until its teeth 2I4 are in the path of movement of the transfer teeth I92 of whichever set of register wheels 35 or 36 is at the time out of engagement with the racks. When the racks are moved towards the front of the machine the wheels that are in engagement with it are turned clockwise and those that are out of engagement are turned counterclockwise until their transfer teeth are arrested in exact zero position by these teeth 2I4 and entirely independently of the transfer pawls. 
 In an algebraic register, positive 0 is the same as negative 9 and vice versa; negative 0 is the same as positive 9. In the described arrangement, positive totals are taken with the add wheels 35 in engagement with the racks, by arresting the subtract wheels 36 at 9; and negative totals are taken with the subtract wheels 36 in engagement, by arresting the add wheels 35 at 9. In short both kinds of totals are taken by the use of, the same stop bail 2I3 which arrests in 9 position, the set of register wheels which, at the time is out of engagement with the actuators. 
Total taking controls Totals are taken automatically without the use of a total key by merely giving two strokes to the main shaft, 52, the first being a blank stroke and the second the total stroke. Mechanism for this purpose is described in the prior application of Thomas O. Mehan, filed May 15, 1935, Serial No. 21,609, now Patent No. 2,114,604, issued April 19, 1938. The total-taking mechanism in the present machine, shown in Figure 18, resembles that described in the Mehan application but differs from it in some respects. 
 In order to distinguish a blank stroke from a computing stroke the stop carriage I3 has attached to its upper surface, at about the rear right hand corner, a small sheet metal flange or bracket 2I8 (Fig. 18) adapted to cooperate with a detent 220, pivoted at 22! to a link 222, extending horizontally front and rear. At its rear end this link is guided by a fixed stud playing in a slot 223 in the link and at its forward end it is pivoted to an arm 224, fixed on a transverse rock shaft, 225, lying just beneath the keyboard plate I3! in a location shown in Figure l. The detent 220 is influenced by a spring 226 and limited in its movement in one direction by a flange overlying the link 222. This detent comprises a nose adapted to be arrested in front of the flange 2 I8, as shown in Figure 18. However, if any numeral key is depressed, the said flange 2 I8 will move to the left out of engagement with said detent and the link 222 will be moved rearward by the spring 226, rocking the shaft 225. Near the left hand side of the machine the shaft 225 has fixed thereon, an arm 221, having a stud 228 projecting through a slot in a locking ear 230, bent up from a plate 23! mounted for front and rear sliding movement. The construction is such that when the link 222 moves rearward as above described, the slide 23! moves rearward and the ear 230 moves under a lever 232, (which is normally held up by a spring 233) and looks that lever against downward motion. It will be perceived that the lever 232 is so locked during each computing cycle of the machine. A bail shaped lever 234 pivoted on a transverse horizontal axis at 235, has an arm 236 overlying the lever 232 and controlled by it. The lever 234 has a depending arm, 231 to which is pivoted the forward end of a link 238, which at its rear end has a slot 240, through which passes a stud 24!, projecting from a lever 242, pivoted in the lower part of the machine, at 243. Said lever 242 also has pivoted thereto an upwardly and rearwardly extending link 244, which at its rear end has a slot through which passes a stud on the link 54, herein before described. The lever 242 is urged counter-clockwise in Figure 18, by spring 245. The whole construction is such that the spring 245 tends to rock the lever 242 counter-clockwise and swing the link 54 rearward to total-taking position, and when the ear 230 is under the lever 232 the parts are locked in add position. The lever 234 has a third depending arm 246 to which is pivoted the so-called total slide 241 which extends toward the rear of the machine and has in it a horizontal slot 248 by which it is guided on the stud I53, as shown in Figure 15. As shown in said Figure 15 and also in Figure 18, the link 241 has beneath the stud I53, a vertical section or portion 250 to which is attached a spring 25!, drawing this total link toward the rear of the machine and aiding by its energy, the action of the spring 245, in swinging link 54 to total position. At its extreme rear end the link 241 carries a roller 252 which lies in the path of the movement of an arm of the cam disc I56, herein before referred to. construction is such that this arm action on the roller 252 restores the total slide and all of its connecting parts to the normal position shown in Figure 18, in the last part of the return stroke of the operating shaft and holds them in normal position as long as said shaft is stationary. The cam disc I56 has on part of its periphery a concentric flange 253 adapted to cooperate with a roller 254 on the total link 241, said flange terminating normally just above said roller. When the shaft 52 makes its forward stroke, this flange 253 moves down either in front of the roller 254 or behind it, depending upon the position of the slide 241 at the time, and positively retains the slide in either position until the end of the return stroke. 
 It is desirable that the link 54, Fig. 18, be held in either its forward or its rearward position by stiff spring pressure so as to seat the stud 51 or 58 firmly in the slot 55 or 56. To this end, the link 244 is connected to the stud on the link 54 by a slot and by a spring 254 connecting two studs, one on the link 54 and the other on the link 244, and the lever 242, when swung forward is swung to such an extent as to put this spring under tension. The position of the stud to which the link 244 is connected needs to be determined with some accuracy and the drawings show provision for its adjustment. As shown, said stud is not secured directly to the link 54 but is secured to an arm 255 pivoted concentrically with the link 54 and secured rigidly thereto in adjusted position by a screw 256 passing through a slot in the link 54. 
 In order to assure that the link 54 is also held in its rear or total-taking position by spring pressure, the stud 24! plays in a slot 240 in the end of the link 238, for the reason that the position of the link 241 is rather rigidly fixed by the cooperation of the roller 254 and flange 253. 
The
