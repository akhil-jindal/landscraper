GENERAL DESCRIPTION This machine is an improvement on the pend- 85 mg applications of Oscar J. Sundstrand, Serial No. 581,800, filed December 18, 1931, and Serial No. 88,092, filed June 30, 1936. The machine includes the customary keyboard with amount keys, date keys and totalizer and printer controlling keys; It has the customary traveling paper carriage that is automatically tabulated from column to column, and which is automatically returned from a predetermined point in the carriage travel. The carriage includes a control plate carrying a series of magazines with control lugs for automatically controlling the numerous operations that are controlled manually by the keyboard. The machine includes eight registers and two crossfooters, four registers and one crossfo0ter being located in an upper group and the other four registers and crossfooter being located in a lower group. All of the registers and crossfooters areactuated by a common set of actuators adjustable under control of pins set by the amount keys. The actuators also control the adjustment of type for printing amounts and totals. Each group of four adding registers has separate transfer elements, and the crossfooters likewise have separate sets of transfer elements, the crossfooters also having independent overdraft mechanism for printing negative balances. Selection of the adding registers is performed by depression of one of four keys to select a particular register in the upper or lower group, and the group in which the desired register is located is selected by the depression of a "second group key." Totals are taken from the adding registers by depressing the proper register selecting keys, operating the machine through a blank cycle, then depressing the register total key and again operating the machine. Subtotals are taken from the adding register in the same manner as totals except that the register non-add key is depressed Jointly with the register total key. 
 The crossfooters are selected manually by a separate lever operating independently from the selecting means for the adding registers. In its normal forward position this lever selects the upper cros'sfooter. When moved one step to its intermediate position it selects both crossfooters, and when moved another step to its rear position it selects the lower crossfooter. The cross- :footers are automatically selected under the control of lugs in magazines mounted on the carriage control plate. When there is no lug in the crossfooter selecting position of a magazine, the upper crossfooter is selected. A short lug in this position of the magazine selects both upper and lower crossioote-rs, while a full length lug selects the lower crossfooter alone. 
 Crossfooter totals or sub-totals may be taken either automatically or manually from either the lower or upper crossfooters. 
 To take crossfooter totals manually, the shift lever is moved to either its forward or rear position to select the desired crossfooter, and a blank cycle taken. The crossfooter total or sub-total key is then depressed and the machine again operated. 
 To take crossfooter totals automatically, the desired crossfooter is selected as explained above. The machine is then given a blank cycle of operation, and the carriage advances to the next columnar position where total or sub-total lugs control the machine to take the total out of the selected crossfooter. 
 Signal mechanism similar to that disclosed in the above referred to application Serial No. 88,- 092 is provided to print a special indicating syinbol for totals taken from the lower crossfooter.

1. The machine sections and general actuating mechanism Referring to Figure 1, the machine includes a keyboard, type bars I for printing on the inserted paper, a laterally movable paper carriage indicated generall at 2, mounted on a track 3, and a control plate 4 mounted on the traveling paper carriage and having a plurality of control magazines for controlling the various operations in predetermined columnar positions. The carriage is provided with the customary roller platen 5 for the insertion of the paper at the rear thereof, and a bail structure I for use in feeding paper sheets in front of the platen. The machine also includes eight adding registers (not shown) arranged in two groups situated one above the other, there being four registers in each group. The selection, engagement and actuation of these registers is fully shown and described in the before-mentioned application Serial No. 88,092. Each of these registers includes a plurality of ten tooth wheels, and each is operable for adding only. Situated in front of these registers are two crossfooters, each having a plurality of twenty tooth wheels II and i2 (Figure 17). The crossfooters are arranged for both addition and subtraction. 
 The conditioning of the machine for adding, subtracting, non-adding, total taking, sub-total taking, computing selectively in the various registers and crossfooters, etc., is controlled manually by the keys and levers situated at the right hand side of the keyboard (Figures 1 and 2). 
 The machine is actuated by an electric motor (not shown). The motor is started by the closing of suitable switch mechanism and is coupled to an actuating shaft 13 (F gure 3) by a suitable clutch mechanism upon depression of a motor bar l4 (Figure 1). The actuating shaft is con nected with the motor drive in such a manner that it is rocked, first, counterclockwise (Figure 3) and then clockwise, about ninety degrees during each operation of the'machine. 
2. Crossfooters-in general These crossfooters, together with their transfer and actuating elements, are identical with those disclosed in application Serial No. 581,800, and therefore, will not be described in detail. 
3. Manual selection of the crossjooters in general The crossfooters are selectively controlled manually for engagement with their actuating racks by a lever l9 (Figure 3). This lever is pivoted on a stud 28 and has a stud 2| on its lower arm. The lever I9 is movable to any of three positions, as illustrated in Figures 6, '1 and 8. A pair of identical detent arms 22 (Figure 3) are pivoted on a common stud 23 and each has three opposing notches adapted to embrace stud 2|. A strong spring 24 holds the latch arms together to retain lever l9 in any moved position. The studs 28 and 23 are mounted on a plate 25 secured to the machine frame. When the lever I9 is in the position shown in Figures 3 and 6, the upper crossfooter is selected and engaged for actuation. When the lever is in its intermediate position, as shown in Figure 7, both crossfooters are selected for engagement, and when the lever is in the position shown in Figure 8, the lower crossfooter is selected for engagement. 
4. Manual selection of the upper crossfooter Referring to Figure 6, a slide 26 is pivoted on a stud 21 on the upper arm of lever l9 and is slidably mounted at its rear end on a stud 28 in the machine frame. The rear end of slide 26 is rounded and underlies a flange 29 formed on a crossfooter selection blank 38. Blank v3l| is pivoted intermediate its ends on a stud 3| in the machine frame and is tensioned counter-clockwise by a spring 32 fastened to the forward end of the blank and to the machine frame (Figure 3). This counter-clockwise tension is restricted by flange 29 of blank 30 contacting slide 26. Blank 38 is provided at its forward end with two notches 33 and 34 below flange 29. The notches 33 and 34 are arranged to engage a square stud 35 projecting from an upstanding arm 36 on the rear of a crossfooter control slide 31. Slide 31 (Figure 3) is mounted upon studs 38 passing through slots in the forward and rear ends thereof and secured in the machine frame. An up standing arm 39 on the forward end of the slide has a projection 46. A spring 4|, secured between the forward end of slide 31 and the machine frame, tensions slide 31 and projection 40 forwardly against a roller 42 carried b an arm 43 secured to actuating shaft |3. The arm 43 in its normal position (when machine is at rest), shown in Figure 3, holds slide 31 sufficiently rearward against the tension of spring 4| to provide clearance between stud 35 and notch 33 to permit adjustment of the latter without hindrance from these parts. As previously stated, when the machine is cycled, actuating shaft'l3 is rocked flrst counter-clockwise about ninety degrees, and then clockwise back to normal position. When lever 9- is in its No. 1 position, slide 26 retains blank 38 in a position where notch 33 lies in the path of forward movement of stud 35 of the crossfooter control slide 31. 
 A shoulder 44 on slide 31 contacts (when the machine is at rest) a stud 45 in an arm 46 of an upper crossfooter control bail 41 pivoted on an axis 48. A strong spring 49 is secured to the other arm 58 of ball 41 (Figure 10) and to the machine frame, tensioning the bail clockwise 7 about its axis 48 and maintaining stud 45 against shoulder 44. A link (Figures and 11) is pivoted on a stud 52 on arm 58 and has a slot 53 embracing a stud 54 on the lower end of an engaging link 55 for the upper crossfooter. Link 55 is pivoted at its upper end on a stud 56 to an upper crossfooter cam lever 56 pivoted on a rod 56 and arranged to controlengagement of the upper crossfooter, as described in a subsequent section herein. A notch 51 in the lower end of link 55 is adapted to embrace a stud 58 on a rocker 59 pivoted on a stationary rod 60. A weak spring 6| connected between link 55 and the machine frame tensions the link counter-clockwise about its pivot 56 and maintains notch 51 ,in engagement with stud 58. It will be, noted that when the machine is at rest there is a gap between stud 54 and the rear end of slot 53 and the lower forward edge of engaging link 55 is adjacent rod 66 (Figure 10). Cycling of the machine causes actuating shaft |3 (Figure 3), arm 43, and roller 42 to swing counter-clockwise on the first half of the cycle, whereupon slide 31 moves forward a slight amount, under tension of spring 4|, taking up the clearance between notch 33 and stud 35. Hence, bail 41 and link 55 are retained in their substantially normal positions wherein the upper crossfooter is selected by virtue of link 55 being allowed to remain connected to stud 58 in rocker 59 during the entire operation to follow. During this operation the lower crossfooter is held idle by parts to be later described. 
5. Manual selection of upper and lower crossfooters jointly When it is desired to accumulate in both crossfooters jointly, the crossfooter selecting lever I9 is moved to its intermediate position shown in Figure '1. When it is moved from the position shown in Figure 6 to this position it moves slide 26 rearwardly, and by virtue of contact with flange 29, it cams selection blank 30 clockwise about its pivot 3| against tension of spring 32 a distance sufficient to raise lower notch 34 into the path of stud 35 on the control slide 31. Spring 24 of detent arms 22 (Figure 3) is superior to spring 32' of blank 36 and thus maintains the blank in its adjusted position. 
 A projection 62 on slide 31 lies in front of a stud 63 in one arm 64 of a lower crossfooter selecting bail 65-(Figures 4 and 10) pivoted on a rod 66. A strong spring 61 is secured between arm 64 and the machine frame to tension bail 65 clockwise about rod 56 and hold stud 63 against projection 62. A downwardly extending arm 68 of bail 65 carries at its lower end a stud 69 lying within a slot 16 in the forward end of a link 1| pivoted at 12 to an engaging link 13 for the lower crossfooter. This engaging link is pivoted at 14 to a lower crossfooter cam lever 14* pivoted at 16 and arranged to control engagement of the lower crossfooter, as described subsequently in another section of this specification. A notch in the upper end of link 13 is adapted to engage a stud 16 on the forward end of rocker 59 although normally such engagement is prevented by clockwise tension of a weak spring 11 connected between link 13 and the machine frame. 
 Upon cycling the machine with lever |9 in the position above described, roller 42 moves forward and permits slide 31 to move forward under tension of spring 4| until stud 35 thereof engages notch 34 of selection blank 30. Such movement of control slide .31 in turn permits bails 41 and 65 to move forward one step under tension of springs 49 and 61 respectively. The amount of movement permitted bail 41 is just sumcient to take up the gap between rear end of slot 53 in link 5| and stud 54 in link 55. Hence, the upper crossfooter remains selected. The amount of movement permitted ball 65 is suflicient to permit superior spring 61 (Figure 10) through link 1! to pull link 13 forward against the tension of inferior spring 11, the forward edge of link 13 temporarily abutting stud 16. Subsequent operation of rocker 59 raises stud I6 allowing spring 61 to pull notch 15 into engagement with stud 16. This selects the lower crossiooter for engagement. 
6. Manual selection of lower crossjooter When it is desired to accumulate in the lower crossfooter to the exclusion of the upper crossfooter, the crossfooter selecting lever I9 is moved to its No. 3 position shown in Figure 8. When it is moved from the position shown in Figure '7 or Figure 6 to the position shown in Figure 8, slide 26 moves an additional step rearwardly and cams selection blank 30 an additional step clockwise about its pivot 3| against the tension of spring 82. This raises notch 34 above the path of stud 35 of the control slide 31. Cycling of the machine with lever i9 in this position allows slide 31 to move forward, under the tension of spring 4|, to its extreme forward position shown in Figure 5, the movement of the slide being limited by studs 38. This movement of the slide permits bail 41 to move to its extreme forward position under tension of spring 49, and bail 65 moves forward to precisely the same position described in the immediately preceding section wherein the lower crossfooter is selected. Extreme forward movement of ball 4'! moves link 5| forward a distance sufiicient to take up the gap between the rear end of slot 53 and stud 54 and further to impart suificient movement to link 55 to withdraw notch 51 from engagement with stud 58 when rocker 59 is operated during the ensuing cycle sufliciently to bring a notch I23 (Figure 11) into alignment with rod 60, spring 49 swinging link 55 forwardly at this time to disengage notch 51 from stud 58. This prevents the upper crossfooter from being selected for this cycle. 
7. Automatic selection of cross-footers in general When it is desired to select the crossfooters automatically, the lever i9 is moved to its No. 1 position and left there during all automatic operations. 
Automatic selection of the crossfooter is under the control of lugs contained in magazines 5 secured on the carriage control plate 4. The general manner in which these lugs operate upon various mechanisms for controlling machine functions, with one exception, is completely treated in the aforementioned application Serial No. 581,800 and will, therefore, not be given here. From Figure 15 it will be observed that as the carliage advances into its various columnar positions, the control lugs, such as 18 and 19, depress corresponding levers, such as 80, which in turn depress corresponding rods, such as 8| (Figure 13)". The exception mentioned is the automatic crossfooter selection control and occupies what is known as the No. 18 or rearmost carriage control position. The outer end 82 (Figure 15) of this lever (see also Figure 3) overlies the projection 83 on the upper end 01. a vertically disposed slide 84. This slide is mounted on studs 85 on the machine frame. ,The lower end of slide 84 carries a stud 86 which lies in the bifurcated end of a rearward extension formed on crossfooter selection blank 30. Spring 82 normally holds slide 84 in its elevated position. When the control lugs depress lever 88, slide 84 is moved downward, rocking blank 30 clockwise of its pivot 3| against the tension of spring 32. The degree of movement imparted to slide 84 determines which crosstooters shall be selected. 
8. Automatic selection of upper crossfooter When it is desired to automatically select the upper crossfooter in a certain columnar position, the No. 18 (crossfooter selecting) position of the magazine 5 is not provided with a lug. When the carriage tabulates to this columnar position and the machine operates, notch 33 of blank 30 lies in the path of stud 35, as shown in Figure 3. The movement of the remaining crossfooter selecting parts is identically the same as described in the previous section entitled Manual selection of the upper crossfooter and hence will not be repeated here. Sufilce it to say that ball 41 is retained in the position shown in Figure 3 wherein the upper crossfooter is selected. 
9. Automatic selection of upper and lower crossfooters jointly When it is desired to automatically select the crossfooters for joint operation, a short lug 78 (Figure 15) is placed in the No. 18 (crossfooter selecting) position of the magazine 5 for the columnar position in which such joint selection is desired. When the carriage tabulates to the position of this magazine, selector 80 is partially depressed and slide 84 moved downwardly a sumcient distance to rock selection blank 30 to a position where notch 34 lies in the path of stud 35, as shown in Figure 4. As above described, movement of blank 30 to this position results in the selection of both crossfooters upon operation of the machine. 
10. Automatic selection of lower crossfooter The lower crossfooter is automatically selected by placing a full length lug 79 (Figure 15) in the No. 18 position of the appropriate magazine. When the carriage tabulates to this magazine, lug l9 depresses the slide 84 its full distance of travel, which in turn moves blank 30 clockwise, its full amount, about pivot 3!, as shown in Figure 5. Operation of the machine with these parts in this position results in operation of the remaining crossfooter selecting parts to select the lower crossfooter to the exclusion of the upper, in the manner above described. 
11. Engagement of upper crossjooter Having made the proper crosstooter selection, engagement thereof with the actuating racks is next effected. Referring now to Figures 10, 11 and 12, an actuating arm 88 is secured to actuating shaft l3 and has a pawl 89 pivoted on a stud 90 and tensioned clockwise about this stud from its position shown in Figures 10 and 11 by a spring 9| connected to one end of pawl 89 and to the actuating arm 88. A plate 92 is pivoted on a stationary stud 93 and has a stud 94 normally embraced by a hook 95 on paw1 89. A lever 96 is pivoted on rod 66 and is tensioned by a spring 98 for counter-clockwise movement about rod 66. A stud 99 lies within a slot in plate 92 to coordinate the movements of the plate and lever 98. The lever 96 also carries a stud I00 to cooperate with a shoulder llll on pawl 89. A stud I02 is secured to plate 92 and is embraced by a notch I03 in the rear edge of a pendant I114. The upper end of pendant I04 is pivoted on a stud I05 secured to a rocker Hi8 pivoted on a stationary rod I01. Another pendant I08 is pivoted on a stud I09 on the rear end of rocker I06 and has a notch I I embracing a stud III on the rear end of another rocker II2 pivoted on stationary rod 56'. A link H3 is pivoted on a stud I I4 on the forward end of rocker I I2 and on stud It on the forward end of rocker 59. As before mentioned, when the upper crossfooter is selected, cam lever 58 is also connected to rocker 59 through link 55. A lever H5 is pivoted at H6 in th machine frame and is connected at its lower end to a pitman II1 connected directly to the upper crossfooter shaft (see Figure 12). For a full disclosure of this mechanism reference may be had to the aforementioned application Serial No. 581,800. 
When the machine is operated, th initial counter-clockwise movement (Figures 10 and 11) of actuating arm 88 rotates plate 82 counterclockwise about its pivot 93. This movement of plate 92 raises pendant I04 and lowers pendant I08. The lowering of pendant I08 oscillates rocker II2, raising link H3 and oscillating rocker 59. The oscillation of rocker 59 lowers engaging link 55 and with it cam lever 58. This first movement of these parts is sufficient to bring rockers H2 and 59 and lever 56 to their substantially horizontal positions. When the lever 55* is in this position a stud I I8 on the upper end of lever II5 lies in the middle portion II9 of a cam slot provided in lever 55 This movement of the parts causes lever II5 to oscillate sufflciently to move the upper crossfooter to a position equidistant from both sets of racks I5 and I5 (Figure 12). In this position the crossfooter is disenaged from both sets of racks and has its wheels held against rotary movement by an aligner I20. The details of this aligner mechanism are not shown as they are fully disclosed in the United States Patent No. 1,965,611, issued to Oscar J. Sundstrand. i 
 The plate 92 and its connections to the crossfooter remain in this position during the remainder of the counter-clockwise movement of actuator arm 88. When rocker 59 is in its horizontal position, notch I23 is opposite rod 50, but since selection of the upper crossfooter restrains bail 41 from forward movement, spring 5| retains notch 51 in engagement with stud 58. At this time the parts are in a position wherein shoulder IOI of pawl 89 lies directly in front of stud I00. 
 The first portion of return clockwise movement of actuator arm 88 moves stud I00 counter-clockwise about rod 66. This oscillates plate 92 clockwise about pivot 93 and returns pendants I00 and I08, rockers H2 and 59, levers 58 and II 5, and the crossfooter to their original positions as shown in Figure 10, wherein the crossfooter is in engagement with theadding racks I5. The movement of these parts to their original positions takes place during the first increment of return movement of actuator arm 88, thereby leaving the major portion of the return stroke for the crossfooter actuator racks to perform their function. 
12. Engagement of upper and lower crossfooters for y'oint actuation Having made the proper crossfooter selection, the upper crossfooter is engaged in exactly the same manner-as explained in the foregoing, the spring 0% (Figure 10) holding notch 51 in engagement with the stud 58 during the operation. When rocker 59 is moved to its horizontal position, stud 16 is raised into alignment with notch 15, as above explained, whereupon strong spring 61 moves link 13 forward, eng in notch 15 with stud 10a. Subsequent counter-clockwise movement of rocker 59 lowers link 13 and thereby raises the rear end of cam lever 14a, engaging the lower crossfooter. It will be observed that cam levers 56 and 149 for the upper and lowerv crossfooters respectively are similar in every respect and are connected for simultaneous and identical movement when engaging link 13 embraces stud 16*, as shown in Figure 11. Since cam lever 14 is connected to the lower crossfooter through a pitman I2I and a lever I22 similar to the corresponding elements for the upper crossfooter, the lower crossfooter is engaged and disengaged simultaneously with the upper crossfooter during this operation. 
13. Engagement of lower crossfooter alone Having made the proper crossfooter selection, notch 51 of link 55 disengages. during the machine operation, from stud 58 against the tension of spring 5|, as clearly shown in Figure 11 and described in the foregoing. Link 13, however, occupies the same position as described in the im mediately preceding section, 1. e., with notch 15 embracing stud 18. 
 With notch 15 in link 13 engagedwith stud 16, and notch 51 in link 55 disengaged from stud 58, the clockwise movement of plate 92 at the beginning of the return stroke of actuating shaft I3 engages the lower crossfooter and leaves the upper crossfooter disengaged, as shown in Figure 11. 
14. Actuation of the crossfooters The actuation of the crossfooters following their engagement with the adding or subtracting racks has been fully described in the co-pending applications Serial Nos. 581,800 and 88,092 of Oscar J. Sundstrand hereinbefore mentioned, For an understanding of this operation reference may be had to these applications. It may be stated, however, that these racks I5 to I8 (Figure 1'?) are arranged for simultaneous vertical reciprocable movement during every machine cycle, and that when the upper crossfooter is engaged, their action is only upon the totalizer wheels II. When both upper and lowercrossfooters are engaged, their action is upon totalizer wheels II and I2 jointly. When the lower crossfooter is engaged exclusive of the upper crossfooter, their action is solely upon the totalizer wheels I2. 
15. Subtraction in the cross-footers Referring to Figure 13, a crossfooter subtract key I25 has the lower end of its'stem resting on a bail l25ipivoted on a rod I21. A slide I28 is mounted for movement forwardly and rearwardly of the machine'and has a shoulder on its front end lying in front of bail I 28. A ball I28 is pivoted on a rod I30 and has a downwardly extending arm I3I connected by a spring I32 to an upstanding arm I33 on slide I28. The tension of spring I32 normally holds a shoulder I34 on arm I3I in contact with a stud I35 on arm I33. A spring I35 normally holds slide I28 and arm I 3| in their rearward positions shown in Figure 13. The other arm I31 of bail I29 likewise extends downwardly and has a fork I38 at its lower end embracing a stud I39 on pendant I08. 
 When it is desired to subtract rather than add in the crossfooters, the crossfooter subtract key I25 is depressed, moving slide I28 forward and tensioning springs I32 and I36. Upon operation of the machine, counter-clockwise movement of plate 92 at the beginning of the operation lowers pendant I08 and moves rocker I I2 to its horizontal position, as explained in the foregoing. As soon as stud II4 arrives opposite a notch I40 in the forward edge of pendant I00, the tension of spring I32 pulls arms I3I and I3?! and pendant I08 forward, engaging notch I40 with stud H4 and disengaging notch IIO from stud IIII. Now upon the clockwise movement of plate 92 at the beginning of the return stroke of actuating shaft I3, instead of link H3 (Figure 11) being lowered to raise the cam levers 56- and 14, it will be raisedto lower the cam levers. Now instead of levers H5 and I22 being rotated counter-clockwise about their respective pivots as in adding operations, they are rotated clockwise by the upper ends of the cam slots in levers 56* and 'I4' engaging the crossfooters with the forward sets of racks I6 and I8 (Figure 11) for subtraction. During the remainder of the return stroke of the actuating shaft I3 the crossfooters are actuated by these racks. The crossfooters remain in en gagement with the subtracting racks at the end of the operation and until the beginning of the succeeding operation, at which time they are brought to their intermediate or disengaged positions by the intial counter-clockwise movement of plate 92. 
 In the above explanation it was assumed that both crossfooters were engaged for the subtracting operation. If, however, only one of them should be engaged, the parts would operate in the same manner as described except that the engaging link 55 or 13 (Figure 11) of the crossfooter unselected would not be operated to move the crossfooter into engagement with the subtracting racks after such engaging link was moved to its intermediate position. Figure 10 shows lower crossfooter engaging link I3 in such intermediate position and Figure 11 shows upper crossfooter engaging link 55 in such intermediate position. 
 For a more detailed understanding of the subtraction mechanism, reference may be had to application Serial No. 581,800. 
16. Taking totals from crossfooters When it is desired to take a total from either the upper or the lower crossfooter, it is necessary to put the machine through a blank cycle with the crossfooter selecting lever I9 (Figure 3) in either its forward or rearmost position. This blank cycle is for the dual purpose of re-- storing any tripped transfer elements and for engaging the selected crossfooter with its actuating racks. With lever I9 in its forward position, engaging link 55 (Figure 10) for the upper crossfooter is engaged with stud 58 during the operation to engage the upper crossfooter, and engaging link 13 for the lower crossfooter is disengaged from stud 16 to disengage the lower crossfooter. With the lever I9 in its rearmost position, engaging link I3 for the lower crossfooter is engaged with stud 16 during the operation to engage the lower crossfooter, and engaging link 55 for the upper crossfooter is disengaged from stud 58 to disengage the upper crossfooter. 
 To change the timing of the crossfooter engaging mechanism for total taking operations, a crossfooter total key I4I (Figure 13) is provided. The lower end of this key rests on a bail I42 pivoted on a rod I43. Bail I42 lies directly behind a projection on the forward end of a slide I44. The slide is mounted for forward and rearward movement in the machine and has an upwardly extending portion I45 with a rearwardly extending arm I46. A bail I48 pivoted on a rod I49 has a stud I50 on one of its arms I5I. A strong spring I52 is connected to porticn I45 of slide I44 and to stud I50 to normally hold arm I46 in contact with the stud. A weaker spring I53 is secured to the upper end of arm I5I and to the machine frame and normally holds the arm and slide I44 in their rear positions. A link :54 is pivoted on the upper end of the other arm (similar to arm I5I of bail I48) and to the lower end of pendant I04. When the crossfooter total key is depressed, slide I4 1 moves forward, and because of the tension of spring I52, pendant I04 is pushed forward, disengaging stud i02 from its notch I03 in the pendant. The movement is arrested by the forward edge of the pendant striking a stud I55 on plate 92. This arrests movement of stud I50 so that the continued depression of total key I46 to its fully depressed position moves arm I46 forwardly away from the stud, stretching spring I52. Upon operation of the machine, the initial counter-clockwise movement of plate 92 at the very beginning of the operation moves stud I55 opposite a notch I56 in the forward edge of pendant I04, at which time spring I52 moves the pendant an additional increment forward to engage the stud with the notch I56. During the remainder of the counter-clockwise movement of the actuating shaft I3 the total is taken from the crossfooter wheels in the manner described in the aforementioned application Serial No. 581,800. At the beginning of the return stroke of the actuating shaft, shoulder IOI of pawl 89 raises stud I00 and thereby rotates plate 92 clockwise, as previously explained in the foregoing, raising stud I55, and with it pendant I04. This disengages the selected crossfooter from the actuating racks, as required before the racks begin their return movement. 
17. Taking sub-totals from the crossfooters When it is desired to take a sub-total from either the upper or the lower crossfooter, the lever I9 is moved to either its forward or rearmost position to select that crossfooter from which it is desired to take the sub-total. The machine is then put through a blank cycle to restore any tripped transfer elements and to engage the selected crossfooter with its actuating racks. Referring to Figure 13, a crossfooter subtotal key I51 has its lower end resting on a bail I58 pivoted upon a rod I59. Bail I58 lies behind a projection on the forward end of a slide I50 mounted for forward and rearward movement in the machine. Slide I60 has an upstanding arm I8I (Figure 16) with a cam surface I62 contacting a stud I63 on the rear end of a bail lever I64 pivoted on a rod I65. The forward end of lever I64 carries a stud I66 lying in the same vertical plane as stud I00. By the above described connections, depression of the crossfooter subtotal key I51 lowers stud I66 into substantially the horizontal plane of stud I00 where it prevents shoulder IOI of pawl 89 from engaging stud I00. 
 Referring to Figure 9, two links I61 and IE8 are loosely connected at their upper ends to the crossfooter total and sub-total keys respectively and at their lower ends to bails I42 and I58 respectively. A forwardly extending arm I69 is rigidly secured to link I61 and extends under a stud I10 on link I68. By these connections, depression of the crossfooter sub-total key depresses link I68 and also the crossfooter total key. 
 When these two keys are depressed, with the crossfooter selecting lever I9 in its forward position shown in Figure 3, and the machine then operated, the upper crossfooter remains engaged with the actuating racks during their initial movement, the same as described above for the total taking operation. However, when the actuating shaft begins its return stroke, stud I60 (Figure 16) prevents pawl 89 from raising stud I and pendant I04. to disengage the crossfooter, allowing it to remain engaged while the actuating racks are returned to their initial position, as required. At the very end of the return stroke of the actuating shaft, hook 95 engages stud 94 and rotates plate 92 clockwise to its normal position shown in Figure 11. 
 When it is desired to take a sub-total from the lower crossfooter, the crossfooter selecting lever I9 is moved to its rear position shown in Figure 8 and the machine operated through a blank cycle to restore any tripped transfer elements and to engage the lower crossfooter for sub-total taking. During an operation with the lever I9 in this position, the lower crossfooter engaging link 13 (Figure 11) is connected with stud 16 to control the lower crossfooter during the sub-total takingoperation, while the upper cross footer engaging link 55 is disconnected from stud 58 and connected with rod 60 to keep the upper crossfooter-idle during the operation. Now upon depression of the crossfooter sub-total key and operation of the machine, a sub-total will be taken from the lower crossfooter in the same manner as explained in connection with the upper crossfooter. 
18. Locks to .prevent depression 0} crossfooter total keys at improper times A well known lock mechanism is provided to prevent depression of the crossfooter total keys until after a blank cycle is taken. This mechanism is fully shown and described in the previously mentioned Sundstrand application Serial No. 581,800, and, therefore, need not be described here. 
 Another lock is provided to prevent depression of the crossfooter total keys when the selecting lever I9 occupies its intermediate position, where it selects both the upper and lower crossfooters, since an erroneous total would be given if both crossfooters were engaged for the same total taking operation. This latter lock is also effective to lock these keys whenever the lever I9 is moved out of either of its other two positions after the preceding cycle was taken. With such a lock it is apparent that a total taking operation must be performed with the selecting lever I9 in a position to select only one crossfooter, and it must be the same crossfooter that was left engaged at the end of the preceding operation. Referring to Figure 9, a plate I1I is pivoted on a stud I12 and has a latch I13 pivoted thereto on a stud I14. A spring I15 is connected to the latch and to the lower end of a lever I18 pivoted on a stud I11 and having a flange I18 normally bearing against the forward edge of plate I1I (Figure 8). Lever I16 is connected at its upper end to a pitman I19 mounted at its rear end on. a stationary stud I80 for forward and rearward s1id ing movement. The rear end of pitman I19 lies clockwise, pin I8I moves pitman I19 a short distance forward. 
By these connections, whenever selecting lever I9 is moved to or through its intermediate position, a stud I82 on the lower end thereof passes over a tooth I83 on-the lower edge of plate I and raises the plate a short distance. Spring I15 thereupon pulls the lower end of lever I forward, engaging flange I18 with a notch I84 in the rear end of plate III, holding the plate in its upper position as shown in Figure 9. This raising of plate 'I1I likewise raises latch I13, engaging a. notch I85 with a hook I06 secured to bail H2 that lies under the crossfooter total key. Since hook I85 must be moved rearwardly (as well as downwardly) whenever the crossfooter total key or (because of arm I69) sub-total key is depressed, these keys are locked against depression and remain-so locked until the machine is again operated to release flange I18 from notch I84 to allow spring I to return plate III to its lower position. 
 To prevent the operator from defeating this look by first-pressing one of the total keys and then moving lever I9, plate I1I is provided with an extended portion I81 on its upper edge. This portion lies directly beneath hook I86 when the hook' is moved rearwardly and downwardly by depression of one of the total keys, making it impossible for stud I82 to move tooth I83 out of its path, and. thus preventing movement of the selecting lever l9 out of its instant position. 
19. Taking 'an overdraft total from the upper crossfooter This mechanism in general is disclosed in the applications previously referred to, but since several changes in this structure are made, description of the necessary portion of this mechanism will be given. 
 When'there is a negative total or overdraft in the crossfooter, and said tool or overdraft is to be printed, it is necessary that the crossfooter be engaged with the substracting racks instead of the adding racks at the conclusion of the blank or spacing stroke. This result can be effected by holding the subtraction key depressed during the spacing stroke. Inasmuch, however, as it is desired that this mechanism be fully automatic. means is provided for automatically maintaining the crossfooter in condition for a negative total whenever it contains such a total. This mechanism includes a slide I81 (Figure. 17) guided for horizontal reciprocation forwardly and rearwardly of the machine, said slide being impelled forward 'by a spring I88. On the rear end of slide I81 is an inwardly projecting arm I89 (see also Figure 14) arranged to engagean upstanding arm I90 on the slide I28 operated by the subtraction key I25, for the purpose of pushing the slide I28 forward into effective position. After each operation of slide I81 it is restored to its normal rear position by a cam I9I secured to the actuating shaft I3, the cam engaging a roller I92 on the slide near the end of the return stroke of the actuating shaft. The slide I81 is prevented from operating to push slide I28 into effective position except when there is an overdraft in the crossfooter. An overdraft slide I93 (Figure 14). movable transversely of the machine, carries an upstanding post I94 lying normally in the path of a shoulder I95 on slide I81 to prevent said slide aesaeec from moving forward under the influence of its spring I 88. A spring I96, connected to slide I93 and to the machine frame, tends to move the latter to the left to remove post I90 from the path of shoulder Hi5. 
 When there is a positive balance in the crossfooter, slide I93 is prevented from moving to the left (Figure 14) under the influence of spring I96 to release slide I81, by a stop arm I91 (see also Figure 17) fixed to a bail I98 pivoted on a rod I99. The upper end of bail I98 is arranged to be moved by a link 200 whenever the crossfooter passes through zero in either direction. When passing from positive to negative, link 200 moves to the right (Figure 17) thereby lowering stop arm I91, and when passing from negative to positive, it raises stop arml91 to the position shown in Figure 1'1. A lever 205 is I pivoted on slide I93 at 202 (Figure 14) and is 20 tensioned counter-clockwise by a spring 208 connected to the lever and to slide I93. A stud 204 on slide I93 restrains lever 20I in the position shown in Figure 14. i The left end of lever 2M lies normally in the same horizontal plane as 25 the end of stop arm I91. Thus, when there is a positive balance in the crossfooter, lever 20I and slide I93 are held by stop arm I91 in position to have post I94 prevent slide I31 from moving forward, and when there is a negative balance in 30 the crossfooter, slide I93 is permitted to move to the left under the influence of spring I99 to allow slide I81 to pull slide I28 (Figure 13) forward to condition the crossfooter for subtraction. In operations where slide I93 is permitted to move to the left (Figure 14), it is restored to its right hand or normal position at the very end of the same operation by a lever 205 pivoted on a stud 206 to the machine frame and operated by an upturned lug 201 thereon lying in the 40 path of rearward movement of the rear end of slide I81. As slide I81 returns to its. rear position, it contacts lug 201 and swings lever 205 about pivot 206, causing the forward end of lever 205 to strike a stud 208 on slide I93 and move 45 the slide to the position shown in Figure 14. Therefore, if, during this same operation, the crossfooter is returned from negative to positive, stop arm I91 will be allowed to rise from under lever 20I to prevent movement of slide I93 to 50 the left during the next operation. 
A means is also provided to prevent slide I81 from moving forward during amount entering 65 operations when there is a negative balance in the crossfooter. It is obvious that if the slide is not prevented from moving forward at this time, the amount entered will be subtracted rather than added. This means includes a sl de 209 70 (Figure 18) extending transversely of the machine and having an upstanding finger 2"]. As fully described in application Serial No. 581,800, the setting up of a digit on the amount keyboard causes a slide 353 corresponding to the slde 209 75 to move a short distance to the right as viewed in Figure 18. This movement is sufiicient to place finger 2I0 in front of the forward end of slide I81 (Figure 17), and thereby prevents forward movement thereof during the ensuing operation. 
20. Taking an overdraft total from the lower crossfooter To take an overdraft total from the lower crossfooter, it is necessary, as in the case of the upper crossfooter, to have the crossfooter en- 10 gaged with its subtraction racks instead of its addition racks. Since the actual engaging of the lower crossfooter with the subtraction racks is controlled by a movement of the same slide I28 as was involved in engaging the upper cross- 15 footer with its subtraction racks, it is only necessary to provide sufilcient additional mechanism to cause the presence of a positive balance in the lower crossfooter to hold slide I93 (Figure 14) against movement to the left and to cause the 20 presence of a negative balance to allow slide I93 to move to the left. This mechanism includes (Figure 17) a bail 2I2 similar to bail I98, to which is secured an arm 2I8 having a pivotal connection with the lower end of a pitman 2H. The upper end of the pitman is slidably supported on a rod 2I5 and has a laterally turned stop arm 2I8 (see also Figure 14) lying in the same horizontal plane as stop arm I91. When the lower crossfooter passes from positive to negative, a link 2I1 (Figure 1'1) is moved to the right, and when it passes from negative to positive, the link is moved to the left in the same manner as above described in connection with link 200. This has the effect of lowering and raising stop arm 2I8 similarly to the movements of arm I91. 
 Referring to Figure 14, a projection 2I8 on the right end of lever 20I lies in the path of a downwardly extending projection 2I9 on crossfooter selection blank 90 (see also Figures 3, 4 and 5). By these connections, when lever I9 is moved from either its forward or intermediate positions to its rear position for selecting the lower crossfooter alone, projection 2I9 moves projection 2I8 forward, swinging the left end (Figure 14) of lever 20I rearwardly against the tension of spring 203 until it lies opposite stop arm 2 I6. Now upon operation of the machine through the blank cycle, slide I93 is prevented from movement to the left if the balance in the lower crossfooter is positive, and is allowed to move to the left if the balance is negative. As in connection with the upper crossfooter, movement to the left allows slide I81 to move forward for engaging the crossfooter with the subtraction racks. 
 By this mechanism, depression of the total key and operation of the machine in the customary manner takes a proper positive or negative total from the lower crossfooter. I 
21. Automatic control of crossfooter subtract, 
total and sub-total operations The crossfooter subtract slide I28, sub-total slide I60 and total slide I are arranged for automatic control by the paper carriage in the manner described generally in section 7. Each of these slides has a corresponding depressible lever 80 (Figure 15) arranged to depress rods 8I (Figure 13) which lie thereunder. Rods 8I rest upon corresponding bell cranks 220 pivoted on a rod 22I secured in the machine frame. The lower ends of these bell cranks rest against the rear ends of slides I28, I90 and I, which, as described in the foregoing, are connected to the keys I25, I51 and I ll respectively. Lugs, such as 19 (Figure i5) placed selectively in magazines 5 on the control plate 4, selectively depress rods 3| and shift their corresponding slides forward, as the paper carriage advances to the various columnar positions, the same as though their corresponding keys had been depressed manually. 
22. Signal printing for totals taken from the lower crossfooter flange, however, normally lies below the path of movement of the type hammer, as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, it is only necessary to oscillate type 222 sufficiently to raise the flange into the path of hammer 222 to cause the lower crossfooter designating signal to be printed. 
 The construction of the mounting for type 222 and the manner in which the type is slidably supported therein is identical with that fully disclosed in application Serial No. 88,092. 
Suflice it to say here that this mounting is pivotaily secured on a shaft 22 secured in a bracket to the machine frame. A lever 22! 'is secured to shaft 224' and is pivoted in a link I". A ball 221 pivoted on a rod 228 has a horizontal arm 229 pivotally connected to the lower end of link 226, and a downwardly extending arm 230 carrying a pin 23l, the outer end of which lies in front and in the path of a projection 232 on an arm 233 of crossfooter control slide 31. The distance between pin 23! and projection 232 is such that when slide 31 is in position to select either the upper crossfooter (Figure 3) or both crossfooters jointly (Figure 4). projection 232 has no influence on pin 23l. However, when slide 31 advances to the position where the lower crossfooter is selected (Figure 5), projection 232 strikes pin 2", rocking bail 221 clockwise about its pivot 223, 
and through arm 223, link 223 and lever 223, rocks type 222 into alignment with hammer 223. 
 In this manner a two-dot symbol (Figure 3) can be printed during operations involving selections Serial Nos. 581,800 and 88,092 is given a number of times in the preceding description, it was not given in every instance where a more complete disclosure of the mechanism may be found. It is, therefore, to be understood that wherever the disclosure is inadequate for a completeunderstandlng of -the invention, such reference should be resorted to. 
 while the form of mechanism herein. shown and described is admirably adapted to fulfill the objects primarily stated, it is to be understood tion to the one form of embodiment herein described, for it is susceptible of embodiment in various forms all coming within the scope of th claims which follow. a
