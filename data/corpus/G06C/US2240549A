' 2 Claims. (01. 164-113) The present invention relates to accountin machines such as cash registers, and particularly to the type in which punching mechanisms are provided for punching a tabulating card to represent the entry effected in the cash register. 
 The cash register controlling the punching mechanism shown herein is of a type which is well known, shown in many patents, and is also incommercial use. This form of cash register is ordinarily provided with a number of totalizers for segregating the sales according to different classifications. The number of totalizers is, however, limited and while they may meet the requirements of certain accounting systems, it is desirable, at times, to effect a further'segregation or analysis of items. This function is attained in substantially unlimited scope by the use of tabulating cards which are capable of being punched to represent items of a series of classi ilcations' and which may exceed the" number of totalizers already provided in the cash register. It is, therefore, the main object of the present known type with a punching mechanism-tor permitting the segregate analysis of the items encards. 
 A still further object of the invention is to devise a structural arrangement whereby the punching mechanism may be controlled by the cash register'without changing the operation or structure of the cash register or effecting, in any way, any'change in the external appearance of the cash register or. requiring a change in the mode of operation-thereof. 
vantage is taken of the diiierential movements oi certain of the'parts of the cash register. and such parts are adapted to periorm the function or a punch selecting mechanism-tor the punching machine. 
 In carrying out another object of the invention the punching machine is preierabLv loregister and so positioned that the punching machine may be operated with the drawer closed. The opening of the drawer will provide access not in operation for the purpose of removing punched cards,.inserting a new supply of cards, adjustment, repair and service. Sometimes, an inspection oi. the punching machine is desirable while it and the cash register are in operation andi'n the present arrangement flexible wire invention to provide a .cash register of a-well' tered-in-the cash register by the use of punched In carrying out the last-mentioned object ad-- cated in the usual cash drawer oi the cash to the punching machine so that access may be- V readily had to the punching machine when it is connections to the punching machine enable unbroken electrical connections from the cash register to the punching machine so that while the drawer is open the operation of the punching machine may be readily observed. 
 The above construction is of value in cash registers which are now in commercial use and which may not have incorporated therein punchmg machines, and such connection may be effected without requiring that the cash register be sent to the factory, since the nature of the changes required for connection to a punching machine is such that they may be readily eflected by a service-man, and without removing the cash registers from the place in which they are installed. 
 A still further object of the invention, and a relatively important one, is to provide an interlocking mechanism between the cash' register and the punching machine which prevents a successive operation of the cash register before the punching of a tabulating card is completed. Where punching is to be eiTected in a number of columns .such punching operations usually require' a longer time than the time required to effect a cycle of operation 01 the cash register. 
Without the provision of a suitable locking mech- 1 anism, it is obvious that the attempt of the operator to effect the entry of a successive item would disturb the operation oi. punch selecting elements controlling the punching machine if the latter has not completed punching operations for a tabulating card. which is'provided in the present machine is to provide a. means for rendering it impossible to close the circuit of the motor'of the cash register until the punching operations have been completed. This would ordinarily be an eflicient type .of lock and preventmisoperations. However, the 
nature of the motor which is utilized in the cash register of a well known type requires an additional locking mechanism which would prevent j the clutching connection between the operating parts of the cash register and the spi'nningarmature of the motor. .As is well known in the type a of cash register shown herein a motor release bar is provided tovefiect upon its depression a clutch connection between the armature of the motor and the operating mechanism 01' the cash register. Upon the completion of the cycle or operation of the cash register, the clutch connec tion is disabled, but the armature, due to its 'momentum,-.keeps on spinning idly. If no means were provided. it is obviousthat when the motor release bar is again depressed, the clutch con- One form of interlock nection could again be made which would effect the partial operation of the operating mechanism of the cash register which would result in shifting the parts of the cash register controlling the punch selecting mechanism out of their adjusted position, thereby causing improper punching operations. 
 Misoperations of the type just mentioned, and which are inherent in the form of cash register shown herein, are effectively prevented by .providing means under control of the punching machine for effectively locking the motor release bar against operation until punching operations have been completed. By the provision of the aforementioned interlocking devices of the two types just'described, misoperations are effectively prevented thereby increasing the efficiency of the combined arrangement. 
 Further objects of the instant invention reside in any novel feature of construction or operation or novel combination of parts present in the embodiment of the invention described and shown in the accompanying drawings whether within or without the scope of the appended claims and irrespective of other specific statements as to the scope of the invention contained herein.

 The present improvement is preferably illustrated in connection with a cash register fully shown and disclosed in the patent to B. M. Ship- 'ley No. 1,619,796, dated March 1, 1927 which refers to lines 1-11 of page 4 back to Patent No. 1,144,418 for the motor-clutch and its release bar on the keyboard. The keyboard, however, is slightly changed over that disclosed in the patent and comprises, as shown in Fig, 1 of the present drawings, ten banks of amount keys I30 and also comprises, as disclosed in the aforementioned patent, ten banks of ledger keys I36, also shown in Fig. 1 of the present drawings. 
 The construction of the banks of amount keys I30 is shown in Fig. 2 of the present drawings and the last-mentioned figure corresponds to Fig. 8 of the aforementioned patent. In each bank of keys there is provided a series of nine keys which are arranged so as to be depressible exterior of the cash register and the construction whereby the keys may be locked in depressed position will now be explained with reference to Fig. 2 in which elements corresponding to those disclosed in the last-mentioned patent are identified by like reference numerals. 
 The keys I30 of each amount bank are slidably mounted in a supporting frame I and said keys are depressed against the action of compression springs I41. 
When a selected key is depressed, the inclined edge I48 of a shoulder of the key will engage a corresponding pin I49 of the related detent plate I42, and it will move said detent downwardly until the shoulder I48 has passed the pin, thereby locking the key in depressed position. The lower arm I which supports the detent plate I42 engages a pin I50 carried by an L- shaped arm secured to rock shaft I52 and upon which a zero stop pawl I5I' is mounted. The downward movement of the detent I42 through the arm I45 and pin I50 rocks the zero stop pawl I5I clockwise to an ineil'ective position as long as the key is depressed and such zero stop pawl releases the differential mechanism of the associated bank to thereby set said elements in a differential position in accordance with the particular key depressed. 
 Each key bank is also provided with a locking plate I43 which has extensions I II which pass over pins I62 of the depressed key I30 and beneath the pins I82 of the undepressed keys in that bank. In order to give the locking plate I43 the required upward movement to effect the looking action just described, its upper supporting arm I50 has a hook I63 engaging a rod I64 carried by arms I65 fastened on the shaft 08. This shaft 08 is rocked counterclockwise upon the depression of the motor release bar as will be hereinafter described whereupon the rod I64 lifts the locking plate I43 into locking position. 
.Diflerential mechanism The differential mechanism of the machine shown in the patent is employed to differentially operate difterent totalizers and also to select type carriers in the printing mechanisms to print the amounts entered in the machine. The differential mechanism in the present improvement is employed to cause the punching of amounts so as to represent the amounts entered in the different totalizers and printed by the type carriers of the printing mechanism. 
 A differential mechanism is employed for each bank of keys and in view of the similarity in construction and operation of the differential mechanism the description will be given in connection with a single order which is fully disclosed in Fig. 2. 
Each order includes segment 305 which is reciprocated by means of cams 348 and 349 for each operation of the machine and as viewed in Fig. 2,.this movement of the segment 365 is first counterclockwise and then clockwise to its. 
normal position. Circular plates 361 and 368 carry three movable segments 366 and which segments operate the totalizerpinions 318. The plates 361 and 368 are connected to the invariably moved segment 365 by a latch 315 carried by arms 316 and 311 pivoted at 318 and 313, respectively. to the plates 361 and 368. 'A foot 38! of the latch 315 is normally held in engagement with a shoulder 382 of the segment 365 by means of a spring 383. 
 By the above described latch connection, the plates 361 and 3.68 and segments 366 are rotated counterclockwise. Fig. 2, until an arm 385 integral with an arm 316 strikes the end of a depressed key. When this occurs the arms 385, 316 and 311 are rotated clockwise thereby disengaging the foot 38! from the shoulder 382. This causes the breaking of the latch and the forward end thereof engages a notch 381 opposite the depressed key. There are ten notches 381 in the plate 388 one for each of the nine keys, one at the zero position Obviously, after the latch has been broken. the segment 365 will continue its counterclockwise rotation but the segments 366 will remain in their differentially set position. When the segment 365 is reversely rocked or in clockwise direction, as viewed in Fig. 2, the segment 365 will engage a pin 386 carried by the plates 361 and 368 thereby reversely rotating said plates to their normal positions during which time the segments 366 actuate the totalizer pinions 318. 
More fully shown and described in the patent to Shipley No. 1.619.796, a beam 448 is adapted to position a link 444 and thereby differentially position an arm 446 and by means of said arm position a segment 449 which is adapted to differentially set the .typeof the printing mechanism so as to print an amount commensurate with the value entered in the machine by the depressed keys. 
 The upper end of the link 444 is pivoted to a segment 445 which isadapted to set certain arts of the indicating mechanism fully shown and described in the patent to Shiplcy. As will be more fully described hereinafter. the segment 445 is adapted to set a switch contact member of an electrical punch selecting mechanism. 
Differential mechanism for ledger key banks shown in Fig. 3 for one bank of keys. Each bank of ledger keys comprises as shown in Fig. 3 ten keys and in such banks of keys the 0 key is depressed so as to cause the printing of "0. This difierentiates the operation from operation of the banks of amount keys '-!38 since no 0 key is utilized in the amount key-banks. The difierential mechanism for the ledger key banks is adapted to effect the setting of ledger number printing devices so as to print the ledger numbers and by means of the present improvements a punch selecting mechanism is assocwiated with each of the banks of ledger keys I36 so as to effect A the selection of punches to punch a number corresponding to the depressed ledger keys. 
 The construction and operation of the differential mechanism is somewhat similar in principle of operation to the difierential mechanism employed for the amount key banks but differs in a number of details of construction and in operation. For this reason, a detailed description will be given of the differential mechanism for the ledger key banks. 
' The difierential mechanism for the ledger key banks is driven by a pair of cams 468 and 46! (Fig. 3) cooperating with rollers 462 and 463, respectively, on a lever 464 pivoted on a stud 465. The lever 464 carries a pin 466 projecting into a slot 461 in an arm 468 fast on a shaft 213. 
 Clockwise movement of the cams 468 and 46! rocks the lever 464 first clockwise and then counterclockwise whereby the arm 468 and shaft 213 are rocked first counterclockwise and then clockwise to normal position. Secured to the shaft 213, for each bank of keys is a member 418. Associated with each member 418 is a lever 41! loose on the shaft 213. Pivoted on a stud 412 on the lever 41! is a latch 413 having a foot 414 normally resting upon the periphery 415 of the member 418. The upper edge of the latch is nor mally in engagement with a notch 416 of a plate 411. Rigid with the latch 413 is an arm 488. Pivoted on a stud 48! on the arm 488 is a. pawl 482 normally in engagement. with a pin 483 on the plate 411. A spring 484 stretched between an arm 485 integral with the lever 41! and a pin 486 on the pawl 482 holds said pin in engagement with the arm 488 of the latch 413. In Fig. 3 the latch is shown engaging the notch 416 in the eleventh or highest position. This is the normal position of the parts when there has been no key I36 depressed in the bank. 
 counterclockwise movement of the shaft 213 rocks the member 418 counterclockwise whereby a pin 481 carried thereby engages the lever 41! and rocks said lever counterclockwise. As the pin 481 engages the lever 41! the spring 484 rocks the latch 413 so that its foot 414 rests upon a portion 488 of the member 418. This counterclockwise movement of the member 418 occurs immediately after the beginning of the operation of the machine. If one of the keys !36 is depressed as the lever 41! is moved counterclockwise. the upper end of the pawl 482 engages the end of the depressed key, whereby said pawl is rocked slightly clockwise until it is past the key. whereupon the spring 484 returns the pawl so that the pin 486 again engages the arm 488. 
 When the clockwise movement of the member 418 to normal position is started the foot 414 is i on the portion 488 of said member. During this the arm 48!) is rigid with the latch 41:, the engagement of said pawl with the depressed key rocks the pawl 482 and latch 413 coimterclockwise as a unit, around the stud 412 thereby disengaging the foot 414 from the portion 488 whereby the upper endoi' the latch 413 engages the notch 416 appropriate to the key which has been depressed. After the latch 413 is disengaged from the member 418 said member continues its clockwise movement to normal position. Upon the next operation of the machine the member 418 is rocked counterclockwise and the pin 481 picks up the lever 41! where it may have been left at the preceding operation and carries it downward to its farthest position and then rocks it clockwise again, through the latch 413, until said latch is broken by the end of the depressed key or, if no key has been depressed, broken by the pin 488 on the plate 411. Thus it can be seen that the memher "I is differentially positioned according to the key depressed. 
 Pivoted to each of the levers "I is a link 498, also pivoted to a spiral segment 49I loose on a rod 482. Through the link 498 and segment 49I the ledger number printing device is set differentially under the control of the ledger number keys I88. 
Motor release bar It is customary to provide means to normally lock the machine against operation in the event that the machine is operated by a crank handle. and also in motor operated machines to release the motor for operation and such means is placed under control of a motor release bar 34, Figs. 1 and 6. The lock for the motor release shaft 88 includes a detent 9|, Figs. 4 and 7. Journaled on a suitably supported shaft 92, a spring I21 holding the free end of the detent in the path of a stud 89, Fig. 4, projecting laterally from a locking arm 98 fast on a release shaft 88. 
 The release shaft 88 carries an arm 88a, Fig. 6, having a stud 81 projecting into a slot I28 in a link 88. This link also has formed therein an opening 84 through which projects a pin I24 carried by an arm I22 journaled at I23 to support the link. A strong spring 85 mounted on slides in the slot I28 presses upwardly against the stud 81 of the arm 88a on the release shaft 88, to rock the latter clockwise. 
 The operation of the release shaft 88 by the spring 85 is normally prevented by the contact of the locking detent 9|, Fig. 4, with the stud 89 carried by the locking arm 98. 
 This lock is controlled by the motor release bar 84, Fig. 6, removably mounted on the upper slide I88 which is slotted to accommodate the guide pins I8I. 
 A pin I88, Fig. "l, on the slide I88 seats in a bifurcation at one end of an intermediate lever I84 pivotally supported on a stud I85, the opposite end of the intermediate lever I84 carrying a pin I88 entered in a bifurcation formed in the arm I81 of a bail I89 journaled on the shaft 92 The remaining arm I88 of the bail I89 is hooked to take over a stud II8 on the arm II4 of a second bail II2 journaled on the release shaft 88, the remaining arm III of such secondnamed bail II2 being forked to engage a stud H3 on the machine locking detent 9i. 
 Obviously, the depression of the motor release bar 84 and its slide I88 will rock the intermediate lever I84 against the tension of its restoring spring IIS, and the lever I84 through bails I89 and H2 will displace the locking detent 9|, Fig. 4, from the path of the stud 89 on the locking arm 98 fast on the release shaft 88. 
 Thereupon the spring 85, Fig. 6, rocks the arm 88a and release shaft 88 clockwise to one limit of its travel, the studB'I being shifted to the upper end of the slot I26 in the link 88. 
 In motor driven machines the release shaft 88. as more fully disclosed and described in the patent to Shipley. No. 1,619,796 and as will be explained in more detail hereinafter, operates to depress the clutch detent and free the motor for operation. the motor driving the shaft H2, Fin. 6, to one rotation. 
 In crank operated machines the operator .iiier depressing the motor release bar 34 actuates the crank handle 45, Fig. 1, through two rotations which through a train of gears 41, 48 and 49, Fig. 6, imparts a single rotation to the shaft II2. 
Locking of amount keys by release of machine The depression of the motor release bar causes the locking of the undepressed keys and the depressed keys in the amount key banks and such is effected by the following described means. 
 For the amount key banks, referring particularly to Fig. 2, it will be seen that when the re lease shaft 88 is rocked counterclockwise effected upon the depression of the motor release bar, the rod I84 will lift the locking plates I43 of the amount key banks, thereby locking the keys which have been depressed and rendering the keys which have not been depressed locked during the remaining part of the operation of the machine. 
Automatic release of keys at the end of the operation of the machine Near the end of the operation of the machine, the shaft 88 is rocked counterclockwise, Fig. o. beyond normal position by the link 86 which is lowered to cause the upper end of the slot I26 in the link 84 to strike the stud 81. This movement of the shaft 88 beyond its normal position is for the purpose of releasing both the depressed amount and ledger keys so that said keys may be restored to normal position by the usual key return springs. Thereafter the link 86 is again raised which latter movement permits the shaft 88 to return to normal position by the action of the spring 85. The opening 84 in the link has an offset into which projects the pin I24 on the lever I22. The lever I22 has a roller I2I cooperating with a cam race I28 in the gear 48 and this cam race I28 rocks the lever I22 clockwise to lower and raise the link 85 as above described. 
 As previously described the rod I84 (Fig. 2) is carried by arms I85 fast on the release shaft 88 and as said rod is lowered past normal position by the clockwise rotation of shaft 88 (Fig. 2') the rod engages projections 250 on the arms I44 supporting the upper end of the detents I42 and forces the detents downward. The locking plate I43 is moved to normal position by this downward rocking of the rod I64 before said rod passes its normal position and said plate is retained in normal position during the continred movement of the rod I84 past normal position so that the return springs I41 are permitted to release the depressed keys to undepressed positlon. 
 At the same time the amount keys are released, the ledger keys I36 (Fig. 3) are also released at the same time. For accomplishing the release of the keys I36 there is provided two arms 21'! which carry a rod 218 engaging a hook 218 integral with a detent plate 21I integral with an arms 212. When the shaft 88 is moved counterclockwise to release the amount keys the rod 218 through its engagement with the hook 219 rocks the plate HI and arm 212 clockwise there by disengaging the projection 218 from the pin 269 of the depressed ledger key permitting the return spring (not shown) to return the depressed key I86 to normal after which the release shaft 88 is rocked clockwise to normal thereby allowing a spring 214 to return the de tent plate Ni and arm 212 to normal. 
tacts move to break the circuit. Pivoted to armv I Motor drive As previously indicated the machine may be operated by an electric motor which is of a well known type fully illustrated and described in the U. S. Patent No. 1,144,418 granted to C. F. Kettering and W. A. Chryst, dated June 29, 1915. For a detailed description of the same reference may be had to this patent. Only a part of the motor clutch mechanism is shown herein and for a better understanding of the operation of the machine the following description is given to understand how the operation of the motor re= lease bar releases the motorfor operation. 
 The motor is mounted on the left side of the machine and is connected to the driving mechanism of the machine by a clutch. This clutch includes a shell 40 (Fig. which is driven by the motor. Rotatably mounted in the frame of the machine is 'a shaft 52 carrying a disc 53 having notches 54 in which are rollers 55 loosely mounted on pins 50 carried by a disc 51 loose on the shaft 52. These rollers are forced away from the shorter sides of the notches by springpressed pins 58 carried by disc 53. It isevident that when' shell 40 is rotated clockwise, Fig. 5, by the motor, the rollers 55, when the disc is released, will wedge between the longer side of the notches 54 of the disc 53 on the inner periphery of the shell 40 and will cause the disc 51 to rotate with the shell 40 in a counterclockwise direction. Fixed on shaft 52 is a pinion 59, the teeth of which engage the teeth of a gear 80a loose on a stud mounted in a side frame. This gear 60a meshes with a gear 6| fast on the main driveshaft H2 hereinbeforereferred to. This shaft receives one complete rotation at each adding operation. 
 When the release shaft is rocked counterclockwise, as seen in Fig. 5, an arm 20la, having a hook 202 normally under a roller 203 carried by arm 204 of a lever 208 pivoted at 205 is moved away from under said roller, which permits said arm 204 to be rocked counterclockwise under the influence of a spring 206 extending between an arm 20! integral with arm 204 and a stud on the side frame. The lever 208 is normally shaft H2 to be rotated by the motor when the electrical contact controlling the motor is made. 
 Behind the disc 51 (Fig. 5) is another disc (not shown), loose on the shaft 52, which is normally under spring-tension and which, when released .by the movement of the locking lever 208, rocks a lever 2l0 by means of a cam surface on its periphery. The lever 2l0 has anarm 2 which cooperates with a roller 2l2 carried by an arm M3 and rocks said arm clockwise (Fig. 5). This arm has a projection which carries insulating material 2 andwhen said arm 2|3 is rocked as above describedthe insulating material 2l4 engages and depresses two spring contacts 2l5 far enough to make contact with two stationary contacts H811 and 2i8b (Fig. 5). The 
circuit through the motor is thereby closed and the motor operated. I 
Just before the end of the operation the before-mentioned disc which closes the motor circuit is arrested, thereby permitting the lever 2l0 to be rocked counterclockwise as the spring con- .204 is a depending inverted T-shaped arm 2" which at its lower end cooperates with a roller 2H3 carried by gear 00a. Near the end of the operation the roller 2l8 comes into contact with the lower end of an arm 2H and raises it, thereby rocking arm 204 and lever I 208 clockwise. This brings the end] of lever 208 into the path of shoulder 209 and when they come in contact the clutch connection is separated and the drive shaft stopped in its normal position. The hook 202 is returned to its normal position at the end of the operation and assumes its position beneath roller 203 on arm 204 and maintains this arm and lever 208 in their normal positions. 
Punch selecting mechanism .As previously intimated, the banks of amount keys and banks of ledger keys are adapted by means of a punching mechanism, to be hereinafter described in detail, to punch a tabulating card, one form of which is illustrated in Fig. 2A. The means whereby the differential mechanisms of the amount and ledger key banks electrically select the punches for punching representations of digits in the tabulating card will nowbe described. 
 With particular reference to Fig. 2, it will be recalled that there has been a previous reference to a segment 445 which is adapted to be set by the difi'erential mechanism of the amount key banks so as to select appropriate indicators. As more fully disclosed in the patent to Shipley No. 1,619,796, the segment 445 is adapted to be retained in its differentially set position and which positioning was effected in accordance with the previous depression of the amount keys 530. Advantage is taken of the provision of the position of segment 445 and its particular manner of positioning to select the punch controlling instrumentalities. As is shown in Fig. 2, a switch carrying member 2| is secured to the segment 445 by any suitable means such as a fastening screw 22, which passes through a plate 23 positioned at one side of the segment 445 and also into the member 2| which is positioned at the opposite side of the segment 445. The member 2|, therefore, partakes of the same differential movement as the segment 445. For each denominational orderof the amount keybanks there is provided a commutator arrangement which comprises a pair of brushes 24 and25 which are carried by the switch member 2| by means of a bracket 26 of insulating material. As best shown in the wiring diagram in Fig. 8, the brush 25 is adapted to have a continuous electrical contact with a segment 21 while the brush 24 is adapted to contact with one of a plurality of contact bars 28. By the differential mechanism hereinbefore described the brush 24 is adapted to make electrical contact with one of the bars 28 while at the same time the brush 25 of the same key bank is in continuous electrical contact with the related segment21. This construction is identical for each of the amount key banks and it is believed that the above description is sufiicient for an understanding of this part of the construction of the machine. As best shown in the wiring diagram in Fig. 8 there is provided a'series of ten digit representing bars 28 each of which has an electrical connection to a related punch control magnet 28 by means of a wire 30. The wires 30 are in a cable 30a (Fig; 9) and are flexible to permit the drawer in which the punching machine is assembled to be pulled out. Obviously, the position of the contact brushes 24-25 will select a particular punch control magnet 29 for energization so as to cause the operation of a related punch to punch a representation of a digit corresponding with the key depressed in the related bank. The manner in which punching operations are efi'ected will be subsequently described. 
 A somewhat similar arrangement is provided for the ledger key banks so that the tabulating card maybe punched to represent the same digits as the ledger keys depressed in the respective banks. The electrical punch selecting mechanism related to the ledger key banks is shown in Fig. 3. It will be recalled that the link 49!! is adapted to be diflerentially positioned so as to select type carriers of the ledger number printing devices and retention of the differential positioning of the member 490 is utilized to effect the selection of punch magnets of the punching mechanism and is effected by the following described means. 
For each bank of ledger keys there is provided a slidable bar 6| which is slidably mounted in bars "and 63 and by means of a spring 54 secured tothe bar ii a lug 65 thereof is adapted to be maintained against the right end of the member 490 and the slidable bar 6i thereby partakes of the differential movement given to the member 490. By means of a bracket 56, which is insulated from the bar Bl a pair of brushes 51, IQ for each order is carried thereby. The brush .1 in a manner similar to the amount key banks is adapted to make continuous contact with a column selecting bar 69, while the brush 6! by its diflerential position is adapted to make contact with one of the bars 10 which are-wired to the digit representing bars 28 and thereby select the appropriate punch magnet. 
 Reverting now to the punch selecting mechanism for the amount key bank it will be noted that for such banks of keys no key is utilized and the differential mechanism therefor will, as stated in the Shipley Patent No. 1,619,796, break the latch at the zero position permitting the brush 2| to make contact with the 0 bar 28 and causing the punching of a "0 in the event that no key in an amount bank is depressed. 
 Now reverting to the description for the ledger key banks, it will be seen that a 0 key is em- Dloyed and in this case the differential mechanism, and accordingly, the member 490, will receive its maximum amount of movement causing the brush 6! to make contact with the 0 bar designated as lilo. However,-in some instances it may be undesirable to require depression of all the "0 ledger keys I36 to effect the punching of '0s" in the tabulating card and in the'present arrangement this is preferably effected by providing the commutators for the ledger key banks with an additional bar- Ilia which has a wire connection II to the 0 bar 28. In the event that no key in a ledger bank is depressed the differential mechanism will be retained in the position shown in Fig. 3 so that as a result of the normal contact of the brush 6'! with the bar 10a the "0" punch magnet 29 willbe selected for op eration when no key in a ledger bank has been depressed. 
 The keys in the ledger bank are adapted to eii'ect the punching of the tabulating card 95 shown in Fig. 2A in columns ii to 26, inclusive, and the group of holes punched at the 0'index vpoint position indicated by A in Fig. 2A indimade in columns of the tabulating card in which no keys of the related ledger banks are depressed. 
Punching machine The punching machine which is coordinated with the cash register and shown in the present application is preferably of the type which is well known in the art and is fully shown and described in the patent to F. Lee et al., No. l,97--',6l8, dated October 9, 1934. Only so much as is necessary to understand the coordination of the punching machine with the cash register and the general operation of the punching machine will be explained herein. 
Referring to the wiring diagram shown in Fig. 
.8 electrical power for operating the cash register is provided for by the insertion of a plug cord 3i in a suitable receptacle having connections to a power supply. This will transmit current to a positive line side 32 and to a negative line side 33 of the cash register. When a switch 35 is closed, current is transmitted to a positive line side 38 and to a negative line side 39 of the punching machine. 
 The normal condition of the punching machine is with tabulating cards 95 to be punched in a supply hopper 4|, (Fig. 9) of the punching machine and with cards therein card lever contacts 4| (Fig. 8) in the punching machine are closed by a card operated lever 42. The last described elements are of a well known type and common in punching machines of the type referred to herein. 
 Also in the normal condition of the punching machine contacts I35 are also closed when the card carriage is positioned to the first column punching position. The means whereby such contacts are closed is fully shown and described in the aforementioned patent to Lee et al., 1,976,- 618 and such contacts are identified by the same reference numeral. 
 After an amount and a ledger number is set upon the keyboard of the cash register the motor release bar 34 is depressed which causes the release of the clutch and the motor of the cash register is set into operation by a circuit now to be described. 
When the motor clutch is released it will be recalled that contacts 2l52i6a, and supple mental contacts 2i5-2i6b (Fig. 5) will be closed, and when contacts 2l5-2l6a are closed a circuit is closed from the positive line side 38, to a magnet 31 of a motor control relay, the circuit ex tending from such magnet 31 through card lever contacts 4 i, first column control contacts I35 now closed, to contacts 2l5--2i6a, to the negative line side 38 thereby effecting the energization of the magnet 31 and the closure of relay contacts 31?) which are located in the punching machine. A circuit is then closed from the positive line side 32 through contacts 2i5--2i6b, from said contacts to the relay contacts 311), through the motor i6 of the cash register and thence to the negative line side 33 thereby causing the motor of the cash register to be operated. 
 After the differential mechanism has been set in accordance with the newly depressed amount and ledger keys and the movable switch contacts of the-related commutators have been differentially set and retained in differentially set position, contacts I53 (Fig. 3) are closed' by means of a cam 154 which is carried by the main drive shaft H2, thereby initiating the operation of the punching machine by a circuit to be subsequently described in detail. 
 Attention is directed to the provision of the so-called column selector shown in Fig. 8 which comprises a stationary contact strip H6 and a movable contact brush II1 which moves step by step as the succeeding card columns are punched. The column selector shown at the bottom of the left side of Fig. 8 comprising in part, the strip H6, movable brush H1 and column contacts .I I8, is well known in the art and is fully described in the patent to G. F. Daly et al. No. 2,016,706, 
dated October 8, 1935. 
The machine preferably has provisions for' punching in the first six columns of the tabulating card shown in Fig. 2A, data which designates the date of the transactions and such data is manually set up by the operator so as to successively'punch a series of cards with the same date. In the card shown in Fig. 2A the date is punched to represent in columns 16 the tenth month, the twelfth day and'thirty-seventh year. 
To automatically effect such punching opera tions the punching magnets 29 have wire connections H9 to plug sockets E of a-plugboard. The column contacts II8 related to the first six card columns have wire connections E28 to plug sockets 629. By means of plug connections I3I, which are shown for the example herein given, the appropriate punch magnets 29 will be selected under control of the column selector II6I I1-I I8, as is well understood. 
Attention is directed to the fact that the contacts I willpermit the operation of the cash register only when the card carriage of the, 
punching machine is positioned in the first card column, and furthermore, the card operated contacts 4! will not permit the energization of the 7 motor relay magnet 31 unless there is a card in the supply hopper of the punching machine. 
 Hence the cash register cannotbe operated unless the punching machine is in a condition so as to effect the punching of a tabulating card. 
 The stick relay contact 310 closed by the energization of magnet 31 of the motor relay retains the energization of magnet 31 after the column selector has moved past the first column position and retains said magnet continuously energized until contacts 2I6a are opened at the end of the cycle of operation of the cash register. 
The punch initiating circuit extendsfrom the line side 39 through the cam controlled contacts to the common contact bar II6 of the punch selector, thence through the movable brush contact element II1'of the column selector to the first column contact H8 when punching is eiiected in the first column, thereby causing the energization of the selected punch magnet29, it being noted that there is a common wire connection I from all of the punch controlling magnets to the negative line side 39. 
Reference has been made to contacts I34 and such contacts correspond to contacts I9I in-the. 
Patent No. 1,976,618, and the function and operation of said contacts I9I is clearly explained therein. As shown in Fig. 8 contacts I 34 are normally closed but are opened by the card carriage when the latter is at the last column punching position. The contacts referred to herein by numeral I38 correspond to the contactsidentifled by the numeral I36 in the last-mentioned patent and reference may be had to said patent for a more complete disclosure of its function and operation. Contacts referred to herein as contacts I39 correspond to the same numbered contacts of the last-mentioned patent, and such patent gives a more complete disclosure of the function and operation thereof. The manner of eifecting'actual punching operations by ineans of a group of punches I46, generally shown in Fig. 9 is well known and fully shown in the Patent No. 1,976,618, need not be described in detail herein. As fully explained in said patent, the energization of one of the punch magnets 29' causes the depression of the coordinated punch I46 whereupon an escapement mechanism is operative to move the card carriage the position of one card column at which time the movable column selector contacts II1 will cause the closure of the circuit to the next selected punch magnet and the punching of the second column will then be effected. 
 Punching operations are effected automatically column by column until the twenty-sixth column of the tabulating card (see Fig. 2A) is punched after which the card carriage is automatically skippedto the last column position. 
 By means of a column skip bar (corresponding to the column skip bar I52 shown in Figs. Band 14 of the patent to Lee, No. 1,976,618) the card carriage is automatically skipped tothe last or the eightieth card column position. When the card carriage is positioned at the last card column position contacts I34 (Fig.8) are now open thereby. deenergizing the punch control relay magnet I33 thus terminating punching operations and preventing further punching operations under control of the cash register until the carriage has beenreturned to the first card column position, by means to be subsequently described. 
 As will be more fully described hereinafter in detail at the last card column position the card carriage releases a card shifting mechanism which shifts cards out of the punching position and then by means of an ejector the punched card is flipped out of card punching position and into a supply hopper. When the card is in the flipped position, by means to be later described, contacts ZIII are closed to cause the energization of a clutch control magnet I15. The energization of this magnet will thereupon open contacts I38 and cause the closure of contacts I9II which thereupon close the circuit to a motor I51. The numerals 2M, I15, I90, and I51 herein identify the same elements as in the patent to Lee 1,976,618 and the operation is substantially the same as disclosed therein. The operation of the motor I51 causes the return of the card carriage to the first card column position. 
' Interlocking devices While the above described mechanism ispracmachine regardless of the operations attempted by the operator. 
From Fig. 8, it will be noted that the relay magnet I33 is provided with relay contacts I33a' which are holding contacts for said relay and retain the magnet I33 energized as well as a control magnet 255, which is located in the cash register, and which is in series circuit connection with the relay contacts I33a', magnet I 33, and the last column contacts I34. It is obvious, therefore, that as long as punching operations are effected magnet 255 will be held energized. The function of the magnet 255 will best be understood by a reference to Fig. of the drawings herein in which it will be seen that the magnet 255, when energized, attracts its armature so as to rock a double arm 258, and when the double arm is rocked it will engage a notch in a member designated by reference numeral H18 and which corresponds to a like numbered element shown in Fig. 2 in the Shipley Patent No. 1,619,- 796. The locking of the member II18 during the punching operations will, since it is pivoted to arm 28Ia which is secured to shaft 88, hold and lock the shaft 88 in its normal position so that even if the cycle of the cash register has completed its operation with the motor clutch shown in Fig. 5 restored to normal latch position, the subsequent depression of the motor release bar 34 will be inefiective torelease the motor release shaft 88. It will then be necessary for the operator to withhold the entry of a subsequent amount in the cash register by the depression of the motor release bar 34 until successive punching operations have been completed for the preceding amount. 
 In cash registers of the type shown in the Shipley Patent No. 1,619,796, the motor therein coasts for some time after the motor clutch has been latched up in normal position at which time the armature of said motor is free to rotate. It will be obvious, therefore, that if the above described means were not provided the re-engagement of the motor clutch caused by a subsequent depression of motor release bar 34 would enable the spinning armature of the motor to operate the main driving shaft II2 of the cash register and move the difierential mechanisms out of their differentially set positions thereby caus- Ing false or improper punching operations. It is, of course, evident from Fig. 8 that as long as contacts I38 shown therein are opened after the card carriage has moved beyond the first card column position the circuit to the motor I8 of the cash register cannot be closed, but since, however, the armature of the cash reelster coasts for a short time after the clutch has been relatched it will be evident that the locking of the release shaft 88 and rendering the motor release bar 34 ineifective in the manner just described effectively prevents the motor of the cash register from operating the cash register in an improper manner by utilizing the spinning of the armature even though means comprising contacts I35 prevents the circuit to the motor from being closed. The above two locks effectively prevent misoperations of the two distinct types. 
Card ejecting device As best shown in Figs, 10, 11 and 12 to the side frame H of the punching machine there is secured a pair of brackets 12, 13 which carry supporting rods 14, 18. A tube 18 loosely surrounds the rod 14 and at its right end the tube 18 has fixed thereto a collar- 11 the latter being adjustably fixed to the tube 18 by a set screw 18. One end of a coil spring 18 surrounding the rod 12 securely fits in the adjustable collar 11 and the other end of the .coil spring 19 is secured to the side frame 13 and the tendency of the coil spring 19 is to rotate the rod 14 in a clockwise direction, as viewed in Figs. 11 and 14. 
 A pair of gripper plates 88 have their ends 8I curved around the tube 18 and are normally in the position shown in Figs. 10, 11 and 14 but are rocked by the rocking of tube 18 to the dotted line position shown in Fig. 14. Secured to the tube 18 is a collar 82 held to the tube by a set screw 83 (Fig. 10) and said collar has a projection 83 which, as shown in Fig. 14, is interposed between the gripper plates 88 to rock the plates 88 by the rocking of the tube 18. A coil spring 84 shown in Fig. 14 is fixed to the gripper plates 88 so as to rock them together and securel-y grip the punched tabulating card 95 as the latter is interposed between the gripper plates 88. A projection 98 of the collar 82 normally rests, as shown in Figs. 12 and 14, on the horizontal edge 91 of a cam plate 88 which is pivoted on the rod 15 and urged by a coil spring 99 to the position shown in Fig. 14. 
 Secured by screws I88 (Figs. 18 and 12) to the bracket 12 is a tube I81 and a coil spring I88 surrounds the tube 18 and is within the tube I61. One end of the spring I88 bears against a fixed bracket plate I88 which is apertured to receive the tube 18 and also bears against a collar I18 secured to the tube 18. The spring I88 urges the tube 18 and parts carried thereby to the left so that the gripper plates 88 seizing the punched card .85 shifts the punched card to the left clear of the punches I48, since in the last column punching position the card is not free of the punches or other guide plates of the punching machine. 
 The shifting of the card is normally prevented by a latching mechanism comprising an extension I1I of a pivoted release arm I12. The arm I12 is rocked by the following described means. The release arm I12 is pivoted by a stud I18 carried by a bracket I19 and at a certain time its rear end underlies an operatingarm I88 which is pivoted on a rod I8I carried by the card carriage. The arm I88 carries a block I (Figs. 10 and 11) and the left edge of the tabulating card 85 bears against this block to align the card on the card carriage. When the card carnage is skipped to the last column position the arm I88 engages a fixed cam plate I82 (Fig. 11) which rocks the free end of arm I88 downwardly to lower block I85 out of engagement with the tabulating card and since the arm I88 now overlies, as shown in Fig. 10, the 1eft end (Fig. 11) of the release arm I12 the latter will be rocked to release spring I88 for action so as to cause the punched card to be moved laterally over the card carriage entirely clear of the punches I46 and without obstruction by the block I85. 
 Projection 98 slides during this operation to the left (Fig. 12) until it reaches an inclined edge I83 of the plate 98 thus permitting spring 19 to rock the tube 18 and thus the ejector plates 88 are flipped during their lateral movement scribed the escapement rack is moved to the right i by the power restoration of the card carriage in the same direction so that pawl I88 will strike the lug I88 but since the pawl will now be prevented from rocking clockwise, since it engages a pin I9I carried by the escapement rack, the movement of the latter to the right will cause the rocking of the arm I89 and, therefore, the shaft I98. 
 Pivotally mounted on the rod 15 and urged by a coil spring I92 (Figs. 10 and 12) is a bail I98 which carries a pair of upstanding stripper fingers I94. When the card has been flipped in which causes the punch restoration of the punching carriage and by means of said punching carriage effects the rocking of the shaft I98 to perform the functions effected by the rocking of this shaft. 
 From what has been previously stated the closure of contacts "I, referring to Fig. 8, will effect the energization of the magnet I15, which is also shown in Fig. 9. The magnet I15 will thereby attract its armature 224 to rock an arm 225, which is diagrammatically shown in Fig, 8, 
' to open contacts I38 and close contacts I98. The 
the manner just described the stripper fingers I 94 will cooperate with one of the longer edges of the tabulating card. As best shown in Figs. 10 and 11 the bail I93 is provided with a bail extension I95 which cooperates with a profile cam I98 secured tothe rock shaft I98. As the shaft I98 is rocked the cam I98 will rock the bail I93 and by means of the stripper fingers I95 positively remove the tabulating card out of cooperation with the ejector'plates 88. In the operation of the machine the stripper fingers I94 are given a rapid operation so as to quickly strip the card from the ejector plates 88 so that the stripped card will fall freely into the storage hopper I84. 
 It was previously stated that when the ejector plates 88 are released for lateral movement, the lug 98 will slide along the horizontal edge 91 of the cam plate 98, and thereafter down the inclined cam edge I83 thereby causing the ejector plates to be rocked to the dotted line position shown in Fig. 14. when in the dotted line' position the lug 98 will strike a lug I91 of a bracket I98 secured to the side frame H of the punching machine, in which position it will be entirely free of the cam plate 98. After the shaft I98 has been rocked to cause the stripper plates I94 to strip the flipped card from the ejector plates 88, arm I99 secured to the shaft I98 will strike a disc 288 secured to thetube 18 by a set screw 22I and engaging the side face of the disc 288 it will restore the tube 18 to the right, as viewed in Fig. 12. The lug 98 will thereupon engage a edge 91of the cam pla'te"98 thereby relatching the ejector plates 88 in normal position as shown in Fig. 14. The parts are now in the normal position, shown in Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 14, placing them in readiness for a subsequent card ejecting operation. 
 As best shown in Fig. 13, the disc 288, which as previously stated is fastened to the tube 18 which is moved laterally and also rocked in a clockwise direction as viewed in Fig. 13, is provided with a projection 228 which is adapted to engage a spring blade of contacts "I thereby closing such contacts and a circuit, as will be subsequently described, to a motor 151 (Fig. 9) 
. circuit to the motor I51. 
closure of the contacts I98 will close an electrical Contacts designated I98 herein correspond to contacts similarly designated in Fig. 1, of the patent to Lee et al., No. 1,976,618, and the same applies tothe designation of the motor I51. The manner of opening contacts I38 (corresponding to contacts I38 of said patent) and the closing of contacts I98 is fully described and shown in Fig. l of this patent. 
 As more fullydescribed in this patent, t e energization of the. magnet I15 will rock an a m 228, shown in Fig. 9, and which corresponds to the arm designated by numeral I11 in Fig. 2 of the patent. The rocking of this arm will effect a clutch connection between the driving shaft 221, Fig. 9, of the motor and a driven shaft 228. By effecting the clutch connection, shaft 228 is rocked and also a gear 229, and which gear corresponds to the gear designated I83 in Fig. 2 or the Patent No. 1,976,618. As more fully described in this patent the rocking of the gear just mentioned will cause a power restoration of the card punching carriage at which time another card will be removed from the card supply hopper I Location of punching mechanism In cash registers of the type herein disclosed, a cash drawer designated 229 in Figs. 1 and 9 is provided, and ordinarily this drawer is used as a cash drawer. In the present arrangement tabulating cards are punched and in the preferred type of accounting such machines would not be used for the reception of the money relating to the purchases of the articles for which tabulating cards are punched. For this reason the cash drawer may be conveniently used as means for carrying the punching machine and Fig. 9 of the present drawings shows how such punching mechanisms may be assembled therein. The drawer 229 is normally closed as shown in Fig. l and may be latched by any suitable means and upon the disabling of this latch the cash drawer may be pulled out so that access to the punching machine may be had for the purpose of removal of the punched cards, the insertion of a new supply of tabulating cards, or accessibility to the punching machine for the purpose of service, re- 
"pairs. and adjustment. The wires in the cable 88a (Fig. 9) permit the viewing of the operation of the punching machine while it is in operation if desired. 
- .well known in the art, maybe provided for the purpose of enabling cash transactions to be handled and one of such drawers or an additional drawer may be usedfor the purpose of carrying the punching machine. From what has been previously described, it will be apparent that the present punching machine may be incorporated in a cash register of a well known type with minor alterations to the machine and without destroying in any respect its external appearance and operation. 
Selection 0/ punching machine for operation It is desirable at times to be able to utilize the cash register without the use of the punching machine and to this end a switching mechanism is provided which will cut out, when desired, the operation of the punching mechanism permitting the customary use of the cash register. As best shown in Fig. 8. the switch 35 is adapted to connect the source of electrical current to the punching machine and when the switch is opened. as shown in Fig. 8, the circuits for the punching mechanism will be ineffective. An additional switch designated by reference numeral 230 in Fig. 8 is adapted to short circuit the relay contacts 31b permitting the normal closure of the circuit to the motor l6 of the cash register. It is obvious, therefore, that when the switch 35 is opened and the switch 230 is closed the cash register may be used without bringing substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated and in its operation may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is the intention, tli rci'ore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the following claims.
