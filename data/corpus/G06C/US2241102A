 This invention relates in general to improvements in calculating machines and, while it has more particular reference to improvements in calculating machines wherein additive actuating mechanisms are optionally arrangeable for key responsive operation and/or key set operation (an example of which is disclosed in United States Letters Patent No. 1,926,826, issued September 12, 1933) it will be apparent that certain features of the invention have other and more general valuable application. 
 I'he principal object of the present invention is the provision of a motor driven calculating machine of improved construction wherein the banks of ordinally arranged digital keys may be optionally operated as a key responsive calculating machine for addition and subtraction and as a key set machine for multiplication and division and in association therewith to provide a shiftable carriage in which the numeral wheels and accumulator mechanism will be mounted and which may be progressively arranged in co-operative relation with the set-up multiplicand for ordinal reception of the adding movements in accordance with a multiplier. 
 Another important object of the invention is the provision of a motor-driven calculating machine of the key responsive type wherein, after a multiple computation has been accomplished, the multiplicand, the multiplier, and the product will all be displayed to the operator, or if of a negative form, the dividend, remainder, a check on the dividend and divisor are so displayed. 
 Another important object of the invention is the provision of a calculating machine to provide an automatic control mechanism of improved construction and arrangement for automatically controlling the series of actuations delivered to the carriage accumulator mechanism in multipleA calculation with the positive, as in multiplication, or negative, as in division. 
 Another important object of the invention is the provision of an error control mechanism operative with both the key responsive and key set mechanisms and acting. to lock the` automatic digital control devices in the event that error is made in setting up the multiplicand or divisor on4 the keyboard. 
 Another important object of the invention is the provision of a locking mechanism for preventing manipulation of the multiplier keys when the ordinal actuating mechanisms are arranged for key responsive action. 
 Another important object `of the invention is the provision of locking mechanism and devices for preventing manipulation of any of the keys of the keyboard when the shiftable carriage is out of cooperative registration with the ordinal additive actuating mechanism. 
 Numerous other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent as it is better understood from the following description which, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, discloses a preferred embodiment thereof.

 The calculating machine shown on the drawings, and constituting the embodiment o! the invention at present preferred, comprises a casing formed of a base plate 5|, a top plate 52, a iront wall 53, a rear Wall 54, a righthand side Wall 55 and a lefthand side wall 56. 'I'he bottom and vertical walls may, if desired, be provided with sound deadening and cushioning packing 51. The 0perative parts are mounted in and carried by a framework which consists of right and lefthand supporting side plates 58 and 59 and intermediate partition plates 6|, all extending from iront to back of the machine and held in rigid relation by tie rods 62 upon which are mounted spacing bushings or sleeves 63. The machine shown on the drawings is of ordinal character and a plurality of accumulator actuating mechanisms for accumulator actuating units is provided, and the several actuating mechanisms of the adding orders of the machine are arranged between the partition plates 8| as in Patent No. 1,926,826 hereinbefore referred to. Each adding order of the machine is provided with a series of digital control keys 64, each such series comprising nine keys bearing the numbers l to 9 to be used in addition and multiplication and their complements to be used in subtraction and division. 
 A plurality of accumulator units, generally indicated by reference characters 55, are mounted in a shiftable carriage generally indicated by reference character 65, which, as will presently be more fully explained, is shiftable transversely of the actuating units and into progressive cooperative relation therewith to cause predetermined additive actuations to be received by and stored in predetermined desired accumulator units. The carriage comprises generally a frame consisting of partition plates 61 secured in spaced relation by tie rods 88 and bushings 89. The carriage is pivoted upon a cross-rod 1| mounted in upward extensions 12 of the side supporting plates 58 and 59 and rests upon a trackway 13 in turn supported upon and xed to said supporting plates. 'Ihe carriage is provided with a carriage housing 14 enclosing its rear, top, front and ends, leaving the bottom open for co-operative engagement between the accumulator units and the additive actuating mechanisms. 
 Each accumulator unit is or may be that described in my aforementioned patent and comprises a numeral wheel 15 adapted to be viewed through sight openings 16 in the casing housing 14 and carrying a pinion 11 in mesh with a pinion 18 which in turn `cooperates through a cyclic gear 80 with a gear 19 which forms a transmitting gear mechanism for advancing the numeral wheels by the desired adding movements and in accordance with the degree of actuation of the ordinal column actuators as received by a ratchet gear mechanism 8| xed upon a cross-rod or shaft 82 carried in the main frame of the machine. 
 In the movement of the carriage and its contained accumulator units across the machine, the gears 19 are disengaged from the ratchet gear mechanism 8| at the beginning of a shifting movement andV reentrained in co-operative relation with other ratchet gear mechanisms as may be desired in the calculation. The carrying is accomplished by power stored in carrying springs 83 through parts and devices identically like those shown inmy patent already mentioned and particular showing or description of them is, therefore, thought unnecessary to an understanding of the present invention. The adding movements are, of course, determined in amount by the particular keys depressed. 
 Each key 84 is provided with a downwardly extending stem 84 arranged through the keyboard plate 52 and through sub-plates 85 and 86. Springs 81 are provided to hold the keys in elevated position and `to return them after each key stroke. Each order of the machine includes a digital .control stop bar 88 arranged to extend beneath the lower end of the key stems when the keys are in elevated position and to be pulled rearwardly of the machine in amount determined by the additive value of the particular key of the order depressed. The stop bar 88 is provided with differentially spaced lugs 89 adapted to engage the depressed key stem of the order, the spacing being such that the stop bar 88 has an increasing unit movement from the l-key at the front to the 9-key at the rear of the associated order of the keys. 
 A link 9| is connected at 92 with a downwardly extending arm or lug 93 on the stop bar 88 and at 94 to a link 95 in turn connected at 9B to a rock sector 91 pivoted upon a cross-rod 98 and provided with teeth continuously in engagement with a pinion 99 forming a part of the ratchet gear mechanism 8|. The link 95 is pivotally connected at its other or front end |0| with an arm |02 of a friction device |03 carried upon a shaft or rod |04 extending across the machine and having bearing in the partition plates 8|. A spring |05 is connected at |06 with a link |2| to be later described and at |01 to the frame of the machine. Upon an adding movement, depression of the sector is accomplished by continuously moving power mechanism to which it is connected hydepression of a key, the result of this connection to the power being that the associated rack sector 91 is swung down the desired amount with a consequent extension of the spring |05 and lthe storing in it of power to accomplish the adding movement upon disconnection of the actuating unit affected from the power means. 
 'I'his power means comprises an electric motor |08 (Figs. 3 and 4). The motor |08 is secured to and carried by supporting plates |09 fixed in the frame at the rear of the machine, current being supplied to the motor through suitable electric Wiring and controls indicated generally at It is not believed that a detailed description of the motor |08 and the wiring for its supply of current is necessary to an understanding of the instant invention. The motor rotates continuously when the machine is in use. 
 The motor shaft ||2 carries a pinion ||8 in mesh with an idler gear ||4 which carries a pinion 5 in mesh with a gear 6 upon a shaft |1 extending across the several columns or orders of the adding machine. This shaft I |1 is provided with a toothed wheel 8 for each order oi the adding machine, these toothed wheels ||8 being arranged adjaxzent the several actuating units or mechanisms. 
 Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, it will be noted that the friction device |03 of each actuating mechanism is provided with an arm |9 pivotally connected at |20 with a link |2| in turn pivoted at |22 in an upright guard arm |23 pivotally mounted rupon a cross-pintor vrod |24 extending across thedframe. An arm l|25 having a tooth 42 and |43 in a clockwise direction and causes the adjacently arranged lockinglnger |49 to or hook |28 at-its free end and a spring-lifted lever |21-.are also pivoted to the upper end of the guard arm |23 on pivot |22. The spring lever |21 is arranged within or beneath a bent-over portion |28 of the hook arm |25 andhas a lip |28 extending over toward the hook arm |25 at the rear end of the spring lever |21. A'y spring I3I is wound about the pivot |22 and normally'holds the hook arm |25 in engagement with the spring arm |21. A spring |32 is secured at |33 to the lower portion of the guard arm l|23 and to the front end of the spring lever |21 at |38 and tends to lift, the free end of spring lever |21 upwardly to sustain the hook |28 of arm `|25 normally out of contact with the toothed wheel ||8. 
In accomplishing a calculating operation, de-r pression oi a key causes the hook arm |25 to engage the toothed wheel ||8 and to be moved a lfull stroke of the machine. The hook arm |25 is provided with two downwardly extending lugs or projections |38 and |31 adapted to be engaged by teeth of the wheel ||8 forwardly of the tooth engaged by the hook as the hook is drawn rearwardly, to lift or cam the hook upwardly and positively disconnect the hook from the engaged tooth at the end of a predetermined adding movement, as may be readily observed from Figs. 'l and 8, whereupon the spring |32 returns the hook arm |25 to its normal level. The power strokes thus induced are all of a predetermined travel which is the same for all digital values. A sector or rack segment 91 is moved downwardly in this power stroke, only the amount permitted by the enter 'into the presented opening |5| of the stem 84 of the key depressed. 
The springs |3| and |32 normally hold the hook arm in an elevated position and clear of its toothedwheel. The hook arm.|25 is .nor- 
mally arranged in elevated position and has a llaterally extending shoulder or lip |52 which is normally disposed a short distance above an appropriately arranged lip |53 provided on the rear end of the link |45, and is adapted to engage the upper side of lip |53 upon depression of hook arm |25. The key bar |38 carries a downwardly extending dog |54 which is provided at its lower end with 'a lug |55 arranged above and in position to engage the lug |29 upon the spring lever |21, this dog being normally held in a rearward position by a spring |51 .tending to swing the dog in a counterclockwise direction (viewing Fig. 8) and maintaining a shoulder |58 extending up from the dog and in engagement with a shoulder |159 on the bar |38. 
particular digital key depressed, downward movement of the sector continuing until halted by engagement of the stop bar 88 with the key stem of the key depressed. The friction device |83 permits continuation of the movement of the link |2| after the halting of its associated sector 81. The power stroke extends the spring |85 and stores up in it the power needed to accomplish the adding actuation-of the accumulator. Upon disconnection of the hook |28 from the toothed wheel, the spring |05 moves the parts back to normal position, the latter part of this movement being accompanied by an upward movement of the rack sector 91, and, through toothed wheel mechanism 8|,by the desired advancement of the numeral wheel of the associated accumulator unit. The earlier part of the return movement under the impulse of spring |85 is taken up in the friction device |83. 
 The control of the hook |25 prevents its engagement with the toothed wheel ||8 until a particular key depressed is locked down into depressed position where it must remain until released. A parallel motion device is provided for each actuating unit and includes an equalizing key bar |38 pivoted at |33 and |4| respectively' to levers |42 and |43, which in turn are pivoted at |44 on rods extending through the partition plates of the frame. The .parallel motion device also includes a bottom bar or link |45 pivoted at |48 to the lower ends of the levers |42 and |43. A key locking bar |41 (Figs. 5 and 18) is pivoted at each end at |48 to the upper ends of the levers |42A and |43 and is provided with locking lingers |49 adapted to enter into conically faced openings |5| (Fig. 18) of the key stems as they are depressed. A key stem in being moved down u'pon depression of the key engages the upper surface of the key bar |38. Depression of this bar by a key stem in its parallel motion swing's the levers y Upon depression of a. key, the dog |54 depresses the spring lever or arm |21, the hook arm |25 being held up at this instant by the interengagement of its lug |52 on top of the lug |53 at the rearend of link |45. The depression of the key moves down its equalizing bar |38 and moves also the link toward the front of the machine, this motion being accomplished through the swinging of the levers |42 and |43. 
 The downward movement of the spring lifted arm |21 provides the proper tensioning of spring |3| lso that when the hook arm |25 drops, the hook will make full engagement with the presented tooth oi Wheel I8, and as soon as the lip |53 on the link or bar |45 moves from under the lip |52 on the hook arm, the hook drops down into engagement with the toothed wheel i8, the drop being accelerated by tensioning spring |3|. Having engaged the ratchet power wheel, which -it* will be remembered is continuously rotated, the vhook is carried rearwardly until the cam lugs or projections |38 and |31 engage succeeding teeth and positivelyV disconnect the hook from the toothed wheel at the end of the desired stroke iwhich, through the parts described, moves the rack sector 31l down into position to produce the desired adding movements in the accumulator on the return stroke. A spring |8| is connected to the key bar and to the lever |42 and normally tends to move the parts of the parallel motion device to raise the key bar when a. key is released after depression. 
 IThe machine shown on the drawings contemplates the locking down of a depressed key and also of the key bar |38 until the rearward movement of the link |2| is nearly complet-ed. A bent lug |82 is provided upon the lower bar |45 of the parallel motion device and a hook latch |83 is pivoted' at |84 on the key bar |38 in position to hook over the bent lug |82 before the key bar reaches its lowest position under the key stroke. In order that this locking down of the key bar and of the key may be accurately released after predetermined travel of the parts, a pin |85 is. provided upon the link |2| in position to engage a downwardly extending finger |88 formed integral with the hook latch |83, striking of the pin |85 against this nger |86 unhooking the latch and permitting the parts to rise again to normal position. 
 Mechanism is provided to prevent reengagement of the latch |83 with the lug |82 if the key auto act. 
chine. In this movement, if a key be held depressed, the lug |29, already mentioned, on the spring arm, strikes against the lug |55 swinging the dog |54 toward the front of the machine and causing the finger |61 to raise the hook latch |63 out of engagement with the lug |62 and the finger |81 acts to hold the hook latch out of operative position until the key is released. Continued depression of the key prevents reengagement of the lug |55 of the dog |54 upon the top of lug |29. Upon release the parts are then moved back into position by the spring |6|. 
 As has been earlier stated, the machine shown on the drawings and disclosing the preferred embodiment of the invention is adapted for operation either as a power-driven key responsive calculating machine or as a power-driven key set machine for automatic actuation. 
 Referring now to Figs. 1 and 19, it will be noted that at the left of the series of ordinal banks or rows of adding keys are two keys indicated respectively by reference characters |8| and 82, the former being labeled key act and the latter These keys are adapt-ed for alternate depression, the depression of one key raising the other. When it is desired to use the adding machine for key responsive operation, the key 8| is or must be arranged in depressed position and when it is desired to use the calculating machine for key set automatic repeated actuations, as in multiplication and negatively as in division. the key |82 is or must be depressed. These two keys have key stems |83 extending down through the keyboard plate 52 and the subplates 85 and 86 and springs |84 are provided to lift the keys when occasion permits. 
 A walking beam lever |85 is pivoted upon a cross-rod |86 just below the keys and this lever has an end |81 located beneath each key. It has also at each end -a lock arm or nger |88 adapted to enter into an aperture in the key stem when the key is depressed and the engaged end of the lever swung downwardly to lock the parts in the' assumed position. The walking beam also has a downwardly extending arm |89 provided with a V-shaped lug or bottom |9| which may engage in either of two slots |92 in a spring lock lever |98 pivoted upon a cross-rod |94 carried by the frame. A spring |95 normally tends to lift the lever |93 and maintain engagement with the V- bottom of the walking beam lever |85. The arm |88 of this lever is connected at |86 with a link |91 extending toward the back of the machine and this link is in turn connected at |98 with an arm |99 xed upon a cross-shaft 28| having suitable bearings in the frame and extending past the various orders of actuating mechanisms. This shaft is arranged closely adjacent the dogs |54 (Fig. 6), which it will be remembered serve to depress the spring levers |21 and through them the hook members |25 into engagement with the power toothed wheel. The shaft 28| is milled to its center at 282 adjacent each dog |54. An arm or ringer 284 is provided on' the dog to extend into the milled portion oi.' the shaft when the parts are arranged for key responsive action. When, however, the key |82 is pressed, the shaft 28| is rocked in a counterclockwise direction (viewing Fig. 5) and all of the dogs of the several orders are swung toward the front of the machine moving their lugs or projections |55 out of registration with the lugs or lips |29 of the spring levers |21. This movement of the dogs also lifts the hook latches |63. Depression of the keys with the parts thus arranged does not cause engagement of any of the hooks with their companion toothed power wheels. When the machine is thus arranged, advancement of the accumulator mechanism in desired amounts is otherwise accomplished as will be presently explained. 
 Means are provided for holding the keys and the parallel motion mechanism in the positions they assume upon key depression. Referring now to the lefthand end of Fig, 5, it will be noted that the forward ends of the links |45 are formed into lugs 285 arranged adjacent companion lugs 288 on latch arms 281 pivoted upon a cross-rod 288 in the frame. Each latch 281 is provided with an arm 289 having its end arranged adjacent a shaft 2|| also extending across the machine and through suitable bearings. 'I'his shaft is milled to its center at 2 I2 adjacent each latch arm 288 and when swung in a clockwise direction (viewing Fig. 5) a spring 2|3 fast to the latch arms and to a rod 2|4 extending across the frame will pull the latch arms up into position to be engaged with the latch extension or lug 285 of the link |45 when a key is depressed to move the parallel motion device of its order. When the latch arms are rendered operative the lugs 286 of the latch arms raise into contact with the latch extension 285 of its companion parallel motion device and upon rearward movement of the link |45 becomes locked in hooked engagement with the latch arm. 
 Referring now to Fig, 19, it will be noted that the shaft 2| carries a fixed arm 2 |5 arranged in front to back general registration with walking beam lever |85. The arm 2| 5 is pivotally connected at 2|6 with a link 2|1 which extends to the arm |89 of the walking beam lever and is slotted at 2| 8 to receive a pin 2|9 fixed to the arm |89. A spring 22| normally holdsthe pin 2| 9 in the forward end of the slot 2 I8. 
 It will be noted that the forward movement of the dogs |54 out'of operative position with the spring levers |21 results in no depression of these levers when a key is pushed down and the mechanism locked in the key set position just described. The spring lever |21 and the hook arm |25 of the order involved are held up by the companion spring |32 until actuated by supplemental mechanism, which will be presently described, this mechanism being adapted to produce repeated actuations to accomplish multiplication and without the release or resetting of the particular key of the actuating mechanism depressed. 
 A shaft 222, having bearing in the frame, is arranged to extend across the several orders of additive actuating mechanisms and is provided with an arm 223 fixed to it and arranged adjacent each such order. A latch 224 is pivoted on each arm 223 at 225 and extends up to above la pin 228 fixed on the companion spring lever |21. Each latch 224 is provided with a hook 221 at its upper end, adapted lto engage over the pin 226 and depress the spring lever |21 each time the shaft 222 is rocked in a clockwise direction (viewing Fig. 6). A stud 228 is arranged -to extend out to the left from the adjacent partition plate of the frame and forms a stop limiting rearwardof times determined by the digital value of themultiplier, and that like repeated depressions of the spring lifted levers |21 will be accomplished. 
Additive accumulation will be produced in the accumulator in accordance with the digital values of the keys depressed and locked in key set position. Each engagement of the hooks of the orders with their toothed power wheels will carry the pins 226 out of engagement with the latches 224. However, upon completion of the operative power stroke, Ithe parts return to the lposition shown in Fig. with the latches 224 again in position to depress the spring levers I 21. 
 Referring now to Figs. 1, 13 and 14,' it will be noted that a column or bank of keys 23| is arranged at the right hand side of the keyboard and one space removedA from the ordinal columns of keys 64. These keys 23| are constructed and arranged like the keys 64 and like them also are provided with stems 232 adapted to actuate a parallel motion device comprised of an equalizing key bar 234, two levers 235 and 236, pivoted respectively upon cross-rods |44, and a lower bar 239 pivoted at its ends to the levers 235 yand 236. A key locking bar 24| is pivoted in the levers 235 and 236 and has locking fingers 242 adapted to enter into openings in the keys exactly as do locking fingers |49 of the lock bars |41 in the key stems 84. The keys 23| are multiplier keys and depression of any one of them results in the connection of the hook arm |25 with the toothed `power wheel for the number of repeated additive operations indicated by the key depressed, i. e. one addition of the set-up multiplicand if the front key, namely the l-key, be depressed; two additions if the second key from the front key be depressed, etc. 
 A ratchet segment 243 is pivotally mounted to rotate about the cross-rod or shaft 98 upon which are mounted the rack sectors 91, already described, and this ratchet segment 243 is disposed in position to control the number of reciprocations imparted to the latch 224 in number corresponding tothe digital value of the particular key 23| depressed by the operator. instant embodiment of the invention the rack sectors 91 extend up to and to the rear from the pivotal supporting rod 98, and the ratchet segment 243 extends downwardly from the rod 98 and into co-operative relation with certain parts and devices to be presently described. 
 An arm 244 extends up above the ratchet segment 243 and is pivotally connected at 245 with a link 246 in turn connected Iat 241 with a differentially movable slide bar 248 constructed, mounted and controlled like the bars 88 of the additive actuating units earlier described. Depression of a key 23|v results in a movement of the ratchet segment 243 in an idle'clockwise stroke (viewing Fig. 13) in amount determined by the value of the particular key depressed. A spring 249 is connected at one end at 25| to the right hand partition plate of the frame and at 252 to the upwardly extending arm 244 forming a part of the ratchet segment member. This spring at all times tends to move the ratchet segment in a clockwise direction (viewing Fig. 13)v and upon depression ofthe key the natchet segment moves down and toward the front of the machine until halted by engagement of the In the adjacent differentially arranged projection 253 upon the slide bar 248 with the stem of the key depressed. Means are provided, which will be presently described, for returning the ratchet segment toward its normal position a one-tooth spacing for each operation of the latch hooks 224, i. e. for each adding accumulation of the multiplicand set up on the main keyboard of the machine. v Y 
 The spring 249 is under tension, as has been explained, and is restrained in its pulling movement upon the ratchet segment 243 and the bar 248 by a latch 254 pivoted at 255 on the b ar 248 and having a hooked forward end 256 normally engaging over a stop lug 251 upon a cleat or member 258 fixed to the adjacent partition plate. 
of the frame at 260. The construction and arrangement of the parts is such that upon depression of a key 23| the latch 254 will be disengaged from its holding lug 251 and the dilferential stop bar 248 may then be pulledrearwardly of the machine by the spring 249 and the ratchet segment 243 moved as already described and until the appropriate differential projection 253 of the 'bar 248 engages the lowered key stem. 
 A latch dog 259 is pivoted at 26| on the equalizer key bar 234 and has its latched end normally arranged above a tail or lug 262 on the rear end of the latch 254. When the equalizer key bar 234 is moved downwardly by the depression of a key, the dog 259 rocks the latch 254, as will be readily understood, and releases the differential bar. A spring 263, xed to the dog 259vbe1ow its pivot, and 'at 264 to the key bar 234, presses the dog into active engagement with the latch 254 to maintain the parts normally in the locked relation just described. 
 As has been hereinbefore partially explained, the ratchet segment 243 is provided with teeth, each of which represents the unit difference between the progressively valued keys l23| and, as additive actuations are imparted by the latches 224 through the spring levers |21, the ratchet segment 243 is returned tooth by tooth to its normal zero value position. 
 When the ratchet segment is set by the depression of one of the keys 23| for a predetermined automatically controlled repetition of additive movements, means are provided to hold the equalizer key bar 234 and the depressed key in set position until the instigated calculation is completed, which means will be presently described. 
 Upon depression of any one of the keys 23| a reciprocatory movement is automatically imparted to the shaft 222. At the righthand side and beneath the bank of keys 23| an arm 213 is fixed upon this shaft and has pivotal connection at 214 with a link 215 pivotally connected at 216 in a guard arm 211 extending up from a lower pivotal mounting 218 in the frame of the machine. A spring 219, fixed at the front at 28| in the frame of the machine, is connected to the forward end of the link 215 at 282 and tends to pull the arm 213, which is xed on the shaft 222, toward the lfront of the machine. Periodic controlled reciprocaton rearwardly of the machine is imparted to the arm 213 and shaft 222 under the controlof the keys 23|. 
 Referring now to Fig. 17, it will be noted that a gear 283 is fixed upon power shaft ||1 and in the column space between the keyboard of the keys 23| and the keyboard of keys 64. The gear 283, of course, rotates continuously andis in mesh` with a pinion 284 pivoted upon a stud shaft 285 and carrying a crank or eccentric pin 288. A link or connecting rod 281 engages the crank pin 288 and a pin 288 provided at the upper end of an oscillating arm 289, which is pivoted upon a rod 29| arranged for bearing support in or near the bottom of frame of the machine. 
 The lever 289 is provided at its top with a cross plate 292, which extends over into the space occupied by the mechanisms controlled from the keys 23| and in its continued oscillatory reciprocation is arranged to actuate such mechanisms to impart the plural or multiple actuation of the additive actuating mechanism already described. 
 'I'he plate 292 is adapted to be engaged, as calculating operations of the machine may require, by the hook end 293 of a hook member 294 pivoted at 295 in the upper end oi' a guide arm 211 in turn pivoted at 218 at ,or near the base of the frame and already described. A spring lever 298, much like the spring lever |21, is provided to control the action of the hook member 294 and is pivotally supportedl with this member at 295. A spring 298, arranged about the pivot 295, acts to hold the spring lever 298 and the hook member 294 in closely adjacent coincident relation. 
 A spring 39| is arranged between the base of the guide arm 211 at 392' and the rear end of the spring lever 299 to lift the spring lever as occasion may permit, 
 Ihe engagement of the hook 293 with the plate 292, as the plate 292 reciprocates, is accomplished as the result of the depression of the key 23|. A forwardly extending horizontal arm 394 is pivoted at 395 in a downward projection of the equalizer key bar 294 and this arm is arranged for engagement with a roller 399 mounted at 391 on the spring lever 298. The arm 394 at its forward end is provided with a bent lip or lug 999 arranged beneath the lower bar 239 of the parallel motion device controlled by the keys 23|. This lug limits upward movement of the arm 394 and the arm is provided with an upwardly arranged hook 3 I 9 adapted to engage'over the pivot 28| of the latch dog 259. Upon depression of a key, the latch dog 259 releases the hook lever 254, and has its lower end resting upon the ledge 399. Depression of a key, therefore, moves the spring lever down since the roller 395 is pressed down by the arm 394. 'I'he hook 293, however, is held up by interengagement of lugs 3| I and 3|2, as will be presently described, to allow the necessary time for the ratchet segment 243 to be swung to its position as determined by the particular digital key 23| which has been depressed. 
 Referring now to Fig. l5a, the hook member 294 is provided near its rear end with a laterally extending lug 3|| normally engaged above or on a lip 3|2 provided at the lower end of a lever 3|3. The lever 3|3 is pivoted at 3|4 on the frame and has an arm 3|5 which normally overlies a xed stud 3|6. A dog 3 |1 is pivoted on the lever 3|3 at 3|8 and has two arms adapted to engage respectively the pivot 3|4 and also the pivot member 291 connecting the diierential key stop bar 248 to the link 248. As the stop bar 248 approaches the normal latched position of Fig. 14 the pivot 241 swings the dog in a countereclockwise direction (viewing Fig. 15) away from engagement with the pin 3|4. A two armed lever 3| 9 is pivoted at 329 on the frame and has its `upper arm arranged to engage over a contact A spring 322 is arranged between a lug 323 on the two armed lever 3|9 and the dog 3|1. The lower arm of the lever 3|9 is arranged for engagement by the plate 292 of the continuous reciprocating lever 289 and, except when a key is depressed, the two arm lever 3|9 rocks idly back and forth. Upon depression of a key, the difierential stop bar 248 moves toward the rear of the machine taking with it the pivot stud 241. This permits the spring 322 to swing the dog 3|1 into position to arrange the lug 32| in the path of movement of the .upper arm of the two armed lever 3|9. Upon engagement of the plate 292, with the lever 3|9, and continued movement, the lever 3|9 and the dog 3|1 are swung as a unit toward the left (viewing Fig. 15-a) moving the lip 3|2 forwardly and from under the shoulder lug 3|| of the hook member 294. This permits the hook member under tension of spring 299 to drop down into engagement with the reciprocating plate 292 and thereafter, at each reciprocation, an adding accumulation of the set-up multiplicand is imparted to the numeral wheels through the arm 211, link 215, arm 213 and shaft 222, as already described. It will be noted that the initial engagement of the hook with the plate 292 is delayed a full reciprocation of the plate, giving the rack segment the small but needed time to assume its controlling position after depression of a multiplier key. 
 The ratchet segment 243 is swung downwardly and toward the front a distance determined by the digital key 23| depressed, being halted in this downward movement by the differentially arranged stop lugs 253 on the bar 248. An arm 324 is mounted upon the rod 98 adjacent the ratchet segment 243, conveniently having a hub 325 embracing the rod and upon which is pivotally mounted the ratchet segment 243. This arm is connected by a link 328 at its lower end to the pivot 214 located at the upper end of the arm 213 which rocks with the arms 223 on the shaft 222. 
 The arm 324 carries a pawl 321 pivoted at 323 in the lower end of the arm 324 and arranged in position to engage the teeth of the ratchet segment progressively to move it back toward normal position one tooth for each oscillation of the shaft 22. A spring 329 iixed at one end at 33| to the pawl 321 and at the other at 332 to the arm 324 normally pulls the pawl into ratchet teeth engaging position. When the parts are arranged in normal position, the pawl is held out of engagement with the ratchet teeth by a xed cam 333 fast upon an adjacent frame part, under which the lip of the pawl rides to move it downwardly to an inoperative position. At; each stroke or oscillation of the shaft 222, the pawl rides of! this cam and into engagement with the presented tooth of the ratchet advancing it one tooth pa rt per oscillation. 
 A back stop pawl 334 pivoted at 335 on an adjacent frame plate is provided to engage and hold the ratchet segment as it is progressively advanced by recprocation of the pawl321. A locking detent for locking the back stop pawl 334 out of operative position at the end of a calculation, so that the ratchet segment may. freely swing the amount determined by the particular digital key depressed, is provided, and comprises a latch 338 pivoted at 331 on the frame and arranged in position to engage a locking lug 338 formed on the back stop pawl 334. 
 A spring v339 is arranged to connect the lower end of the back stop pawl 334 and the latching member 339, normally pulling the back stop pawl pawlv 321.v The back stop pawl 334 is provided with a finger 34| extending across the path of plained, shiftable across the units of additive actuating mechanism through a lifting and a sliding motion, ythese motions being accomplished as travel of a pin 342 on, the forward edge of the f v ratchet segment 243. When the ratchet segment has beenl returned in its tooth-by-tooth movement to normal position, the pin 342 engages the finger 34| and swings the back stop pawl 334 downwardly, arranging the lip 338 in position for engagement beneath the latch 336 so that the back stop pawl 334 is thereafter held down out of operative position until the ratchet segment is again moved for an adding calculation. The spring 213 at the end of a calculation holds the links 215 and 326` forwardly upon disengagement of the hook 233 with the plate 232, causing the actuating pawl 321 to ride beneath and be held down by the cam 333. It will, therefore, be noted that no pawls engage the ratchet segment when 'the parts are in normal non-calculating position. 
 In order that the equalizing key bar 234 may be held down and the depressed key locked against return movement until the end of the desired number of additive calculations, there is provided al lever 343 pivoted at 344 on the equalizer bar and having a hook 345 at its lower end adapted to engage beneath a lock plate 346 xed on the frame of the machine. A spring 341 normally swings the lever 343 in a clockwise direction (viewing Fig. The upper end of the lever is adapted to engage a stud 348 mounted upon the link 246 which connects the differential key stop bar 248-with the ratchet segment. When the parts are in normal non-calculating position the stud 348 maintains the lever in the position shown in Fig. 13, pressing it in a counter-clockwise direction against'the force of the spring 341. UponV depression of a key and a diiferential rearward movement of the stop bar 243, the stud 348 moves. rearwardly and releases the lever 343, permitting it to latch up as the equalizing key bar 234 reachesy the bottom of its movement. Once latched with the lock plate 346 on the frame, the lever 343 holds the parts in operating and repeating position until the return movement of the ratchet segment causes the stud 348 tov again engage the lever 343 and release the parallel motion device for return movement. 
 Means are provided also for insuring against continued actuation as the result of failure to release a key 23| once depressed. 
 It will be remembered that the latch lever 254 is pivoted at 255 on the differential stop bar 248 and, of course, moves toward the front of the machine as this stop bar is returned toward normal position after a key depression. Just before it reaches its normal position, its rear end 262 engages the upper end of latch lever 253 and swings it to the position shown in Fig. 14, this occurring at the end of the last tooth latch segment advance. 'I'he lever 253 is thus disconnected from the lip 303, whereupon the spring 30| swings the hook 233, the spring lever 238 and the arm 304 upwardly, as may be observed in Fig. 14, and out of the path of movement of the plate 2'32 on the oscillating lever 283. Upon release of the key, the equalizer key bar 234 and the other parts of the mechanism return to their normal position ready for the next actuations. 
 The carriage in which the accumulator mechanisms or units are mounted is, as has been exdescribed in my earlier filed patent already men-l tioned, to detrain the gears 13 from the ratchet' gear mechanisms 82 in the initial movement of lthe carriage. The carriage is held up as it is shifted and until it is lowered to reentrain its accumulator gears 13 with the then presented ratchet gear mechanisms 82; The carriage may be lifted directly by pulling up on finger pieces 364 arranged at each end of the carriage, or by the turning of a knob 365 arranged at the front of the adding machine and upon a shaft '366 extending to the back and carrying a gear 361 in mesh witha toothed bar 368 in the carriage, all asin my earlier patent referred to. .It is desirable that,V when the carriage is lifted, either directly or through manipulation of the knob 365, all of the keys 64 and 23| be locked against de.- pression and until reentrainment of the gears establishes co-operation between the accumulator units and the additive actuating mechanisms. 
 Referring to Fig. 17, which is a section taken through the machine and between the column of multiplier keys and the bank of keys 64, it will be noted that a lever 363 pivoted upon the cross-rod 38, extending across the machine, `has its upper end 312 formed for engagement with the forward or free edge of the carriage and that upon lifting of the carriage thisend 312 will be swung toward the front of the machine. A shaft 313 extends across the machine and has bearing in the side support plates and in the intermediate partitions. This shaft is provided with an arm 314 having a pin 315 at its end which is engaged in a relatively large opening 316 in the lever 369. A spring 311 normally holds the pin 315 toward the front edge of the opening 316. Lifting of the carriage swings the lever 363 toward the front of the machine and similarly swings the arm 314 and rocks the shaft 313. This shaft carries a dog or latch 318 for each column of keys and the lower end of each of these dogs is provided with a locking lip 313 adapted for engagement beneath a lug or projection 38| provided upon the rear end of the associated equalizing key bar |38, 234 so that when the shaft 313 is rocked, as just described, all the orders, both of the yadditive actuating mechanism and of the multiplier keys, are locked against operation. Each lip or lug 313 is angularly disposed as is also its co-operating shoulder 38| on the companion equalizer bar. The purpose of this construction is to permit of the locking up of orders` of the machine even though other orders may be in depressed condition, the 
' lip 313 of each order depressed moving in above the companion lug or projection 33|. 
 A plurality of counter wheels 382, having ratchet teeth 383, are mounted upon a cross-rod vor shaft 384 in the carriage and behind sight openings 385 (see Figs. 1, 5 and 6). A lever 386 is pivoted upon the cross-rod 38 in the frame and carries a pawl 338 adapted to progressively advance the counter wheels 382 as the lever is reciprocated. This lever atits lower end is provided with a jaw 383 in which is engaged a stud 33| upon an arm 332 fixed to the shaft 222. As this shaft is rocked in multiplying and in negative calculation in dividing, the lever 386 is oscillated and the counter wheel engaged with it advanced correspondingly. Shifting of the carriage across the actuating mechanism and the multiplier column presents desired counter wheels for actuation by the lever 386, as lust described, so that at the end of an example the multiplier or dividend is displayed through the sight openings 385 of the carriage. 
 Means are provided for insuring complete key strokes of the digital keys 64 of the additive actuating mechanism units, as will now be described, reference being had particularly to Figs. 9 to 12, 5, 15 and 17 of the drawings. 
 A latch 393 is pivoted at 394 on each bar 145 of each parallel motion device of the adding actuating 'mechanism. A spring 395 normally presses a lip 398 of the latch 393 up into contact with the under surface of its bar 145. A ratchet tooth 391 is provided upon a ratchet member 388 arranged upon the upper end of a lever 398. The lever 399 is pivoted at 401 in a yoke 402 which in turn is pivoted on a cross-rod 403 extending across the several orders of additive actuating mechanisms. A spring 404 is attached at 405 to the lever 399 and to a lip 408 upon a lever 401 pivoted upona cross-rod 409. Upon depression of one of the keys 84 the bar 145 is moved toward the front of the machine, i. e. toward the left (viewing Fig. 9), and the latch 393Lbeing carried by it moves with it and past the ratchet tooth 391. 
 If a key be released without fully'eiective depression, the forward movement of the link or bar |45 will be incomplete and the spring 161 of the parallel motion device (of which it forms a part) tends to return the parts to their original position without accomplishing the calculating operation. In order to advise the operator that an incomplete key stroke has been made and to insure redepression of theparticular key in necessary amount, locking mechanisms are provided, which will now be described. As a result of an incomplete movement and through mechanisms to be now described, all of the columns of keys, except that in which the insufficient key stroke has occurred, are locked against operation as a warning or notice to the operator of an insuiiicient or incomplete key stroke. 
 A link 409 is pivoted at 411 to the upper end of the lever 399 and is provided at its rear end with a hook 412 normally engaging a stud 413 fixed in the frame and limiting forward movement of the lever under the influence of the spring 404. The link 409 is pivoted at 414 to the upper end of an arm 415 in turn pivoted at its lower end at 416 in the cross-rod in the frame. This link 409 is provided with a laterally bent or extending lug 411 arranged in the path of an upwardly extending arm 418 attached to a shaft 419 extending past the several orders of the machine. This shaft 419 is provided with an arm 421 extending forwardly of the machine and carrying a lip 422 at its free end. This lip is normally arranged behind and holds forwardly the lower end 423 of a companion arm 424 fixed upon a cross-shaft 425. Rocking of the shaft 419, upon insufficient key stroke in any column, lifts the arm 421 and frees the arm 424 so that it may be brought to locking position as will be now described. The shaft 425 is provided adjacent each column of the machine, including the multiplying column, with a leaf 428 extending out over the tail 421 of a locking dog 428 mounted upon a cross-rod in the machine. Springs 429 normally urge these dogs rearwardly into position to engage beneath shoulders 431 on the forward ends of the equalizer key bars 138, 234. The springs 429 pressing upon the leaves 428 move the arm 424 into a counter-clockwise direction when the arm 421 is lifted by the incomplete key stroke of a particular column and move also the dogs into locking position into all of the columns except the one in which the insufficient key stroke has occurred. The dog 428 of this column is prevented from engaging beneath its companion shoulder 431 of its equalizer key bar by reason of the circumstance that the latching of the latch 393 has prevented the complete return to normal position of the parallel motion device. 'I'his is accomplished through the engagement of the arm 415 with a stop 430 appro-l priately arranged in the path of the return reciprocation of this arm. It will be noted that since the latch 393 is engaged at this time with the ratchet tooth 391 the link 408 and the arm 415 must move back with the bar 145. Correction of the error by the complete and proper depression of a key permits the parts to return to normal position, whereupon the dog 429 of the column affected moves to locked position and the complete locking of the keyboard is accomplished. 
 Means are provided for moving the ratchet tooth 391 out of the path of the latch 393 if and when full key stroke is accomplished. An arm 432 is provided upon the yoke 402 to'extend across the path of a roller 433 carried upon the link 121. As the parts near the end of the power stroke, the roller 433 engages the arm 432 of yoke 402 and lifts the yoke about; its pivot 403 carrying up the lever 399 lto raise the ratchet tooth 391 above the lower edge of the bar and out of the Way of the latch 393. The yoke 402 has a rearwardly extending arm 434 formed into a bent lip at its end which is adapted to engage beneath a shoulder 435 when the lever 399 is lifted by vthe roller 433. This lever is held in this upper latched position until near the end of the return stroke when a lug 436 on the bar 145 engages the upper end of the lever 401 to disconnect it from the arm 434, arranging the parts for the next calculating operation. A rearwardly extending lug 410 is provided on the lever 399 for engagement with the rod 403 to limit downward movement under the pull of the spring 404 when the parts are moving from one position to another. 
 To prevent miscalculation from redepression of a key before the adding operation of the previous stroke is completed, a number of ratchet teeth 431 are arranged on the ratchet member 398 and in position to be engaged and locked by a latch 438 arranged at 439 on the bar 145 as this bar and the key depressed return to normal. It has also been pointed out that the key must be fully depressed or the keyboard locks. After full depression of the key, the lever 399 is lifted and effort to depress the parallel motion device through the key before the adding movement is completed will cause engagement by the latch 438 with one or the other of the teeth 431 since during the return or adding motion of the bar 145 the lever 399 is held in raised position by the lever 401 and is adapted for engagement by the latch 438 if the depression of a key tends or attempts to move the bar- 145 in the reverse direction, i. e. upon a new adding actuation, 
 Referring now to Fig. 17, reference character 45| indicates a key for releasing the column locks set into action by the insufficient depression of a key as just described. The key 451 is provided with a stem 452 which is arranged above a turned-over end 453 of a lever 454 mounted in the column space between the multiplier keys and the additive actuating keys being pivoted upon
