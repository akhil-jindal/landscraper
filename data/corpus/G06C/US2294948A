12 Claims. (01. 2s5 145) This invention relates to calculating machines, and has particular reference to. the type having a carriage shiftable into difierent operating positions. 
 The present invention is disclosed herein in its preferred form as embodied ina machine'of the type shown in the Patent No. 2,271,240," 
 granted January 27, 1942, on the copending Avery application, Serial Number 84,927, filed June 12, 1938, including tabulator mechanism of the type shown and claimed in the copending Avery application Serial Number 213,195, filed June 11, 1938, to both of which reference is had for a complete disclosure of the calculating machine, including mechanism not specifically disclosed herein. It "is to be understood, however, that the invention is not to be regarded as limited to application to machines or mechanisms of the type set forth in the above applications. For example, although the invention is shown applied to a machine in which the shiftable carriage supports registers for movement relative to actuating mechanism therefor, certain features of the invention will also be useful in calculating machines wherein the registers are stationary and the actuating mechanism is shiftable relative to the registers. 4 
 It is the general object of the present invention to facilitate manual control of difierent power-operated mechanisms of --a calculating machine. 
A more specific object of the invention is to reduce the number of manual operations required afterone machine calculation to condition the calculating machine for a subsequent calculation; 
 Another object of the invention is to preselectively adjust an operating mechanism to subsequently operate any of a plurality of machine control devices. 
A further object of the invention is to enable a value selecting key to control operation 0! must be manipulated by the machine operator. For this purpose. the devices for resetting or clearing the registers are automatically controlled, the carriage being moved to a predetermined position and the'register or registers reset automatically upon setting of one of the value selecting keys. l'hus after a calculation has been completed on the machine, the machine operator need only'start setting the various value selecting keys for the next problem. Upon depression of the first s'uch key operation of the register resetting devices and the mechanism for moving the carriage to a desired position is automaticallyinitiated. 
 The manner'in which the above and other objects of the invention are accomplished will be readily understood on reference to the following specification when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:

Manually set selection mechanism The present invention is disclosed as embodied in a machine commercially known as the "Marchant calculating machine, which is of the key: set type in which means are provided.for first setting one factor of a calculation upon a keyboard and subsequently operating the machine in a manner indicated by the character and amount of another factor of the calculation. 
 The mechanism for setting up the first factor may be considered as comprising a manually operated and a power portion, the manually operated portion being designed to be moved to a selected controlling position by the depression of keys, and the power operated portion being designed to be brought into operation by control keysand to operate the various calculating mechanisms under the control of the manually set mechanism. 
As viewed in Figure 1, the various value selecting keys I 00 are arrangedina series of banks of nine keys each, the number of such banks provided depending upon the magnitude of the factors with which the machine is designed to deal. Each keybank comprises a channel shaped key frame I0l (Figures 2 and3)' in which the key stems I 03 of the various keys I00 are slidably mounted. Compression springs I02 are provided to normally maintain all of the keys I00 in a raised position. 
 .1111 of the key stems I03 are of the same length and each has a cam extrusion II6 which, upon depression of the associated key, pushes to'the right, as viewed in Figure 2, a slotted key locking slide II'I, slidably supported on the lower side of the channel IN by rivets I04, therebyv releasing any other latched down key in the same key section. Upon full depression of any value key stem, the slide III is returned 'to its initial location by spring H0 and by overlying the upper end. of the extrusion II6 latches the depressed key. 
Disposed underneath the value keys I00 is a differentially settable bar I20 (Figure 2) which is pivotally suspended from the keysection frame IN by means of two parallel links I26 and I29. This bar I20 has nine identical divergent notches I30, each of which terminates in a rectangular slot I3I proportioned to receive the end of key stem I03 so that the bar I20 will be accurately positioned thereby. The key stems I03 are spaced an equal distance apart and this distance is slightly greater than the spacing between successive slots I3I so that each succeeding slot I3I will be spaced one increment further away from its cooperating key stem. Thus, depression of a value key will cam the bar I20 to the right a number of increments equal to the value represented by the depressed key. I 
 Such movement of each of the bars I20 is utilized to set up a mechanical representation of the selected value to control the calculating mechanism accordingly and for this purpose, a swinging segment member I32 is connected by means of a pin and slot connection I63 to each bar I20, and is pivotally mounted on a common 5 shaft I31 extending across the machine and supporting like members associated with other key banks. Each of these segment members I32 is provided at opposite ends thereof with arcuate racks I30 and 136 which serve to transmit the "movement of the differential bar I20 respectively, through a, pinion I45 to a check dial assembly I40 rotatably mounted on a shaft HI and through a gear ISI to a cam unit I46 which is positioned by such movement to form a mechanical representation of the value set up on the associated key bank. 
 Ea ch cam unit I46 comprises a gear I5I and five cams, one of which is shown at I52. Each "one of the cams has two high points. I60 and two low points I6I on its periphery. The cams are so staggered that no high or low point on one cam is aligned with a high or low point on another cam. 
 As described in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent No. 2,271,240, the various cams on the cam unit I46 are so arranged that upon depression of a value key I00,- the gear ,I6I, meshing with the arcuate rack I39, will rotate the cam unit I46 to a position wherein one of the high points of one of the cams will be positioned in the path of a nose I2II of one of a set of five feeler arms. I2I0 on one side of the cam unit I46, or in, the path of a nose I2I9 of one of a set of five feeler arms I2I'I on the opposite side of the unit I46. 
Power set selection mechanism Since this power operated mechanism is disclosed rocked by suitable mechanism (not shown) to effect engagement of a cyclically operable setting clutch 430, the details of which are also disclosed in the above Avery patent. 
Upon engagement of the setting clutch 430, 
, power derived from adrivingm'ot or 640 (Figure 22) is transmitted through a train of elements, 
including gears 645, 646, 641, 302, the latter of which is suitably connected to a gear 640 meshing with a gear 430, through the setting clutch 430 to a setting shaft 43I. 
 Keyed on the setting shaft 43I are a number of pairs of complementary cams identical to cams I220 and I 22I- (Figure 2) and each such pair has an associated cam follower I224 pivoted on a links I226, impart a counter-clockwise rocking movement to a series of levers I2I4 rockably mounted on a shaft 30I. 
shaft I2I3 supported by the levers I2I4 has pivotally mounted thereon the groups of feeler arms I2I0 hereinbefore described, one of these groups being located adjacent each of the cam units I46. During the leftward movement of the feeler arms I2I0 by the shaft I2I3, each of the noses I2II formed on the feeler arms I2I0 engages the periphery of its respective cam on the cam unit I46, thereby causing each feeler arm I2I0 to pivot about the.point of contact between'its respective nose and the periphery of its associated cam. The balance of the forward movement of the shaft I2I3 by the cam followers I224 effects forward movement of the lower end of the feeler arms I2I0 and this move- .ment is transmitted through a link I2I6 to rock v a second feeler arm I2I1 aligned with each of rically opposite that engaged by the nose I2II of the associated feeler arm I2I0. 
 As was described hereinbefore, each of the cam units I46 is so arranged that only one of the associated pairs of feeler arms I2I0 and [2H will have their respective noses in engagement with the high or low points of a cam at any one setting of the value keys I00 in the respective key section. Thus, one of the feeler arms I2I0 will be rocked a considerable angle about its supporting'shaft I2I2 to one side or the other of a supporting shaft I59 by the remaining cams, a 
 be held in their respective medial positions causing their upper slotted ends to assume a position substantially as shown in Figure 2. 
Each of the feeler arms I2I0 is connected through a pin and slot connection I206 with a plate I12 pivoted on a shaft I10, and arranged on each plate is a set of gears I14 and I10, meshing with a laminated gear I09 rotatably mounted on shaft I10. 
 From the above it will be seen that four of each group ,of five of the selection plates I12 will be held in a medial position substantially as shown in Figure 2, while the fifth will be moved forward or rearward until the lowermost 2 gear I10 thereon meshes with an aligned gear I15 on a shaft I66 or an aligned gear I16 on a shaft I61. v 
 Gear I15 is one of a group of four'gears I11 (Figure 22) keyed on shaft I66, and adapted to mesh with gears on four of the selection plates I12. Likewise, gear I16 forms one of a group of five gears I10 mounted on the shaft I61 and adapted to mesh with gears on the five selection plates I12. The three leftmost gears of this latte group are keyed to the shaft I61, while the two rightmost gears I00 and I99 are free on the shaft I61 and mesh with gears I05 and .200, respectively, keyed on a third shaft I60. 
 The shafts I66, I61, and I60 are connected to the motor 640 (Figure 22) in a manner described hereinafter, so that shaft I66 rotates through 180 for each cycle of operation of the machine, and shaft I61 rotates through for each cycle of operation of the machine, while shaft I60 moves through 30 for each cycle of operation. The diameters of the various gears in the two gear groups I11 and I10, corresponding to each keyboard order, are so arranged that for each machine cycle, the gear I09 (F gureZ) will be rotated by one of the gears of the groups I11 and I10, a number of increments corresponding to the value of a key I00 which is depressed during a machine cycle. If no key is depressed, the selection plates I12 will be so arranged that none of the gears of groups I11 and I10 will become operative to drive the gears I13. 
 At the start of-a machine cycle, and in advance of rotation of the gears I09, a gear I21I, having a gear I213 of the accumulator register meshing therewith, is dipped under control of the setting shaft 43I by means (not shown) to mesh with the" gears I09 and thereby transmitrotation to a numeral dial of the accumulator register visible through an opening 4I0 (Figure l) in the carriage order. Suitable tens carry mechanism (not shown) is provided as disclosed in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent No. 2,271,240. 
 As was mentioned hereinbefore, the various gears on shafts I66, I61, and I60 are adapted to be driven by the motor 640 (Figure 22) and for this purpose a cyclically operable main clutch 650 and a gear 450 connected to the driven side of the clutch 420. During each cycle of the operation of the clutch 420 (one-half revolution thereof) a one-half revolution is transmitted to a shaft 429 and this rotation is, in turn, transmitted through a reversible transmission (not shown), through gears 450 and 404, to the shaft I66. The shaft I61 is entrained with the shaft I66 through gears 405, 406, and 481, while the shaft I60 is entrained with the shaft I61 through gears 400 and 409. 
 Initiation of operation of the main clutch 420 is controlled by the setting clutch 400, and for this purpose a cam 141 (Figure 23) is keyed on the setting shaft 431 and engages a roller 145 and 1319. 
carried by a cam follower 146 pivotally mounted on a shaft 501 and urged into engagement with the cam 141 by a tension spring 143. After the various feeler arms 1210 and 1211 and the selection plates 1012 have been positioned under control of the complementary cams 1220 and 1221, the cam 141 engages and rocks the cam follower 146 counter-clockwise enabling a tip 615 carried thereby to engage a notch 616 formed in a main clutch dog 395 pivoted on a shaft 611 and normally held in engagement with the main clutch 428 through a toggle link arrangement 610 and tension spring 612. As the cam follower 146 causes the tip 615 to engage and rock the dog 395 out of engagement with the clutch 420, this clutch couples the shaft 429 with the continuously driven gears 415 and thus effects actuation of the various actuator gears 111 and 118. 
 At the end of a machine cycle (one-half revolution of the main clutch 428) during addition or subtraction operations, the spring 612 causes the dog 395 to again engage the clutch 420 and thereby uncouple the shaft 423 from the gear 4 I 5. However, during other calculations such as division and multiplication, the dog 395 is held from engagement with the clutch 428 by mechanism (not shown) until completion of the proper number of cycles of operation as controlled by the automatic control mechanisms disclosed in'the Avery Patent No. 2,271,240 referred to hereinbefore. 
Carriage shifting mechanism The controlling mechanism embodying the present invention to be hereinafter described is designed to control carriage shifting mechanism of the type used in the commercially known Marchant calculating machine. It is therefore desirable to give a brief description of the operation of this carriage shifting mechanism before an explanation of the novel controls. 
 As shown in Figure 15, the hereinbefore mentioned motor driven gears 352 and 543 are rotatably mounted on the shaft 1305, the latter gear being mounted on a flange 1301 which'is keyed to the hub of the gear 362. Gear 540 has secured thereto a dished supporting disc 1309 to which is welded aninternal gear 1315. Gear 1315 is in mesh with three equi-spaced planetary gears 1315 (Figures and 16) riveted to each of three shafts 1311, respectively, which extend through clearance holes provided in a ratchet wheel 1303 and have end bearings in plates 1310 1303a. The planetary gears 1315 also mesh with a sun gear 1320 formed at one end of a sleeve These plates and the ratchet wheel 1303 are secured together as a rigid unit by studs 1321 to the opposite end of, which is suitably keyed a second ratohet-wheeb 1305. Both sleeve 1321 and the ratchet wheel 1305 are journaled on the shaft 1308. 
 Gear teeth 1322 are formed on each shaft 1311 and these mesh with a second sun gear 1321 to which is secured a gear 1324 meshing with a gear 1326 rotatably mouned on a shaft 1331. This latter gear is held between a pair of friction discs 1330-and 1332 which are keyed to a shaft 1331, the latter disc being pressed against gear 1325 by a compression spring 1331. 
 Interposed' between the compression spring 1331 and the friction disc 1332 are a disc I335 keyed to shaft 1331, a sleeve 1333, a second disc 1362 also keyed to the shaft 1331 and supporting a pair of diametrically opposed roller 1363, and a washer 1338. A pair of lock nuts 1333 are adjustable along the threaded end of shaft 1331 to regulate the amount of friction applied between the gear 1325 and its friction discs 1330 and 1332. 
 The shaft 1331, driven by the reversible gear transmission through the gear 1323, is Journaled in a bearing 1340 and in a second bearing 1344 supported by a bearing bracket 1343. A beveled gear 1341 secured on the shaft 1331 meshes with a second bevel gear 1342 fixed on the lower end of a vertical shaft 344. This shaft is journaled in bearings provided in brackets 353 and 1343, and has fixed at the upper end thereof a hub and plate assembly 356 on which are mounted rollers 351 adapted to engage between the teeth of a rack 355 (Figures 15 and 18) mounted on the shiftable carriage 350. Thus, upon rotation of the assembly 356 by the planetary transmission mechanism, the rollers 351 engage the rack 355 and shift the carriage 350 laterally either to the left or to the right depending upon the direction of rotation of the shaft 334. 
 The shaft 1331 may be selectively rotated in either direction to effect a shift of the carriage 350 either to the right or to the left by holding one or the other of-the ratchet wheels 1303 and 1305 from rotation, depending upon the direction of carriage shift desired. If the ratchet wheel 1303 is'held, rotation of the planetary gear 1313 about the sun gear 1320 will be prevented and the planetary gears will function as idlers to transmit rotation from the internal gear 1315 driven by the gear 362, to their integrally connected gear 1322 to the sun gear 1321, whereby the gear 1324 will be rotated in one direction. If, however, the other ratchet wheel 1305 is held, thereby holding stationary the gear 1320 integrally attached thereto, the rotation of internal gear 1315 will feed the planetary gears 1313 about the fixed sun gear 1320 with which they mesh, thereby causing them to rotate on their own centers and also to rotate about the sun gear 1320, thereby driving the gear 1324 in an opposite direction, 
 To effect such selective shifting of the carriage, a clutch member 1301 (Figure 16) pivoted on a stud 1233 isprovided. The member 1301 has a pair of latch dogs 1302 and 1304 extending therefrom, the former being adapted to engage and hold the ratchet wheel 1303 from rotation when the member 1301 is rocked in a clockwise direction,,as viewed in Figure 16, while the latter dog 1304 is adapted to engage and hold the ratchet wheel 1305 against rotation when the member 1301 is rocked in a. counter-clockwise direction. 
If theclutch member 1301 is held in a neutral position. as illustrated in Figure 16, wherein neither of the dogs 1302 and 1304 is engaged, the differential merely idles and there is no drive to the shifting mechanism. 
 Means are provided whereby either of the dogs 1302 and 1304 is held in engagement with its respective ratchet wheel during approximately the first three-quarters of a shift cycle to positively insure the completion of any initiated shift regardless of how soon the control member 1301 is urged toward its neutral position after having once been moved lto shift controlling position. On a leftward extension of the clutch control member 1301 (Figure 16) is a laterally extending ear 1354 adapted to be engaged with either the top or bottom surfaces of a projection. 1353 formed on a latch member 1350, said latch member being pivotaliy mounted at'1351 and urged toward engagement with the ear I354 by a spring I352 (Figure 16 and Figure 16A) When the control member I 30I is rocked either clockwise or counter-clockwisefrom its neutral illustrated position, the projection I353, normally held in the position shown by the ear I354, will snap into latching position either above or below the ear I354 under tension of the spring I352 and thereby latch the clutch member I 30I against return movement into its neutral position until the shift has progressed through approximately three quarters of its current cycle, at which time it will be released by the latch member I350. 
 Provision is made -for additionally tensioning' the spring I352 during the first portion of the' shift cycle, and for this purpose a centralizer I364 (Figure 16) is utilized, the upper end of spring I352 being attached to the extreme left hand end thereof. The centralizer I364 is pivotally supported at its right hand end (not shown) andis held in engagement with the two diametrically opposed rollers I363 by the spring I352. 
 When the shaft I33I starts to rotate at the beginning of a shift cycle, one of the rollers I363 carried on the disc I362, which is keyedto the shaft I33I, cams the centralizer I364 upwardly thereby increasing the tension of the spring I352 and insuring latching engagement of the projection I353 with the clutch member I30I. 
 Provision is made for moving the latch mem ber I350 from latching engagement with the clutch member I30I upon completion of approximately three-quartersof the shift cycle. For this purpose,"a cam I334 (Figures 16 and 16A) having a pair of diametrically opposed lobes formed The lower end of lever MM is attached to the left end of a link I483 so that the rocking of I shaft I485 imparts a longitudinal movement to the link. I463. ,This link is provided with a notch I414 on the ,right'end thereof which embraces a U lateral extension I41I formed on the lower end thereon is rotatably mounted on the sleeve I333. 
and is driven by the disc I335 keyed to the shaft I33I so as to cam a nose I351 formed on the lower end of the latch member I350 at the end of approximately three-quarters of a shift cycle. 
 To insure the same cyclic time of operation of the latch member I350 for reverse rotation of shaft I33I,'the disc I335 is provided with two shoulders I360 disposed approximately apart so that a pin I36I secured on the cam I334 will, upon clockwise rotation of the shaft I33I, be engaged by the shoulder I360 on the opposite side of the disc I335 (Figure 16A) only after the disc has been rotated about three-eighths of a revolution (which is three-quarters of a cycle.) 
 Although the drive to the carriage to the shift mechanism is thus terminated at approximately three-quarter cycle position, the shift drive train will be rotated through the remainder of its cycle by the centralizer I 364 which is pressed by spring 1 I352 against rollers I363 on disc I362 secured to ond lever I48I, also having two spaced lugs I485 identical with .those on the lever I480, is freely mounted on the shaft I485 in juxtaposition with 5 the lever I480. A spring H is compressed between the four lugs I466 thereby forming a yieldable connection between the lovers I480 and MM, by means of which a rocking motion may be transmitted from the shaft I465 to the lever I48I. 
This means comprises a shaft of a lever I315 pivotally mounted on a shaft I316." The upper end of lever I315 is pivoted to-a link I314 which has at its rear end an apert'ure in which extends two spacing lugs I5I0. In juxtaposition with the rear end of the link I314 is another but shorter link I5II with an identical aperture, also with two facing lugs I5I0. Links I 314 and I5 are yieldably" connected together by a compression spring I5'I2 located over the four lugs I5I0. This link I5 is pivotally connected at its forward end to the clutch member or dog I30I by a stud I3I5. 
 Provision is made for returning the clutch member .I30I to its neutral illustrated position when not restrained in shift controlling position by the latch member I350, or means described hereinafter, by a centralizer I403 which is pivotally mounted on the machine frame at I404. A lug I403a extends laterally from the centralizer I403 into engagement with the lever I315 above the shaft I316, while an adjustable lug I4I1 having an offset I H5 is mounted on the lower endof the centralizer I403 and engages the lever I315 below the shaft I316. A tension spring I400 extends between'the lateral extension I402 and a stud M on the machine frame to urge the centralizer against the lever I315. Thus, the centralizer I403 tends tomaintain thelever I315 in a neutral position in which the clutch member I30I will be ineffective, and will return it to this neutral position automatically upon release of the latch I350, providing'the shaft I485 is free to be rocked by the lever I48I. 
The carriage may bereleased from the carriage shifting mechanism above described to en able manual traverse thereof, by rocking the rack 355 (Figure 18) about a supporting shaft 34I therefor, upwardly out of engagement with the roller 351 on the assembly .356. An arm 335, extending from the rack'355 through a slot in the carriage cover, terminates in a knob 335 to facilitate manual release of the rack 355. A tension spring 331 extending between the arm 335 and the carriage cover normally maintains the arm 335 against a stop pin 338 so as to move the rack 355 in mesh with the rollers 351. 
Tabulator setting mechanism The machine shown in Figure 1 is one in which the carriage may be moved to eight different op;- erating positions and, to facilitate shifting of the carriage to any of these eight positions, eight tabulator keys 200 (Figure 1) are provided. However, any number of operating positions with a corresponding number of tabulator keys, may be provided depending upon the magnitude of the factors with which the machine is designed to deal. It is to be-understood that the mechanism controlled by each tabulator selection key is duplicated in all orders of the'machine so that only one order will be described in detail. 
 Aside from selectively initiating various dial clearance functions, as will be. hereinafter described, the tabulator keys 200 have two primary functions; first, to position the tabulator controlling mechanism for a shift of the carriage in the correct direction; and; second, to initiate operation of the carriageshifting mechanism. 
Each of the keys 200 (Figures 2'and 4) is tached to the front frame plate of the machine.' 
 A compression spring 204 normally holds each sub key stem 202 in a raised position unless it is latched down by a lug 203 located adjacent the lower end of the stem 202 (Figure which is adapted to abut the under surface of slidable lock bar 2 I 3. A notch is formed in the stem202 below the lug 209 and embraces a lateral extension 2 formed on a lever 2l5, which is rockabiy mounted on a. shaft 236 so that downward movement of the sub stem 202 by depression of the respective tabulator key 200 will impart a counter-clockwise movement to lever 2l5. A roller 2i6is riveted on the rearwardly extending arm of the lever 2| 5 and is adapted to impinge one or the other of the divergent sides 23l of a tabulator control lever 200 and cam it to the position shown in Figure 4. 
The mechanism shown in this figure is that of an order in which. the key 200 has been depressed and all parts are in the position they assume when the carriage has come to rest in the selected position. 
 Means are provided to latch the stem 202 in a partially depressed position until it is released by depression of another one of the series of tabulator selection keys 200. The lugs 209 (Figure 5) on the lower ends of the key stems 202 are provided with curved surfaces at the bottoms thereof to cam the lock bar 2i3 to the right against a compression spring (not shown) during the downward movement of a respective key stem 202 until the lug 209 passes underneath the lock bar 2H, and thus allows this lock bar to spring back to a position overlying the top of the lug 209 to latch a particular key in its partially depressed position. As another key 200 is depressed, its corresponding lug 200 again cams the lock bar to the right, thus allowing any depressed key to be raised by its respective spring 204 (Figures 4), and the second key to be locked down in the same manner as the first. 
 Pendulum type interlocks 205 (Figure 5) are provided to prevent the simultaneous depression of two or more keys, and are attached to the tabulator key frame 200 by shoulder studs 206 so that these interlocks are free to rock about their respective studs. The key stems 202 are provided with arms 2| 2 (Figure 4) tooperate against shoulders 201 of the interlocks 205. As shown inFig. 5, a key stem 202 has been depressed and the arm 2l2 thereof, in passing downwardly between two adjacent interlocks 205, has forced the interlock to the right thereof to rock counter-clockwise about its stud 206, and similarly has forced the interlock to the left thereof in a clockwise direction. 
 A representation of the desired position of the carriage having been set into the tabulator control mechanism by the depression of 'one of the keys 200, it is also necessary to set into said mechanism a representation of the present position of the carriage, and for this latter purpose a tabulator controller movable in time with the lateral shifting movement of the carriage is provided. Tabulator controller 210 (Figures 4 and 12) is riveted, or otherwise secured, to two rearwardly extending arms 21! of a bail 219 which transversely on a worm shaft 215. Between the flanges of the ball 210, from which arms 21! are extended, is a bushing 213 freely rockable on shaft 210 and a nut 212 which engages the groove of the worm shaft 215. On one end of the nut 212 (Fig-- ure 12) is a flange 200, having a notch 210 formed on one side thereof, adapted to embrace an angle plate 2l0 (Figure 4), secured to key frame 200, thereby preventing rotation of the nut 212 with the shaft 215 and causing rotation of said shaft to effect transverse movement of the nut 212, the bail 213, and the controller 210. 
 Means are provided whereby movement of the carriage will drive the worm shaft 210 (Figures l2 and 18) at such a rate as will impart a lateral movement to the controller 210 proportionate to the movement of the carriage, but in the opposite direction; this opposite directional drive being necessary only because the number one tabulator selection key 200 is preferably situated at the extreme right side of the keyboard while the number one position of the carriage is at the extreme left. For this purpose a driving rack 333 (Figures 1'7 and 18-) is attached to the carriage 350 and has downwardly protruding teeth adapted to engage a spur gear 332 fixed to the upper end of a shaft 330. Two brackets 33| and 321, secured to the machine frame, support the upper and lower ends of shaft 330, respectively, bracket 33] having a bearing fixed thereto, while the bracket 321 supports an adjustable thrust bearing 323, in which the lower end of the shaft 330 is journaled while a nut 328 permits adjust ment of said thrust bearing to insure the correct engagement between a bevel gear 326 secured to the lower end of shaft 330 and a second bevel gear 325 fixed to the left end of worm shaft This construction affords a positive drive from the carriage 350 to the worm shaft 215 and the correct timing thereof, and in viewing Figure 17 it will be seen that leftward movement of rack 353 imparts counterclockwise rotation to gear 332, shaft 330, and bevel gear 326 (Figure 18), which in turn rotates bevel gear 325 in mesh therewith and its integral shaft 215 in a clockwisedirection to ultimately produce a rightward movement of controller 210 (Figure 12). 
 The controller 210 (Figure 12) is so mounted as to permit it to rock a sufficient amount about its shaft 215 to freely follow the movement of control levers 200 as they are rocked about shaft 205 from one to another of their various displaced positions. Spaced projections 260 (Figure 4) are provided on the flange 269 of the nut 212 to serve as limit stops for the bail 213 connecting arms 21!. The distance between the projections 268, however, is enough greater than the width of the bail to allow the required movement of is mounted on. and is free to rock and to move the controller 210 and bushing 213 with respect to the nut 212 and member 263. 
 Shaft 205 (Figure 4) is provided with a wide keyway into which the narrower keys 202 of members 200 extend; said keys being sumciently narrower than their keyway to permit limited rocking movement of each of the levers 200 with respect to shaft 205. 
 The controller 210 (Figures 12 and 14) extends laterally a sufficient distance to insure that it will always engage in the recesses 216 of at least three adjacent members 200, and has three steps of different elevation, 211, 216a, and 210 (Figure 14) by virtue of which it positively positions the control levers 200 engaged thereby at as great a stagger with relation to each other as the keyway of shaft 205 will permit (see Figures 1313, 
I a,2o4,o4e 130, -and ,13D.' Each lever 288 has a laterally formed ear 283 overlying a nose 284 on the next lever to the right in such a manner that when a lever is positioned clockwise as shown in FigureC/ 13D, all those to the right of it are positioned equally far clock-wise, and when a lever is positioned counter-clockwise as shown in Figure 133, all to the left of it are positioned equally .far counter-clockwise. Thus controller 218 serves to positively locate all levers 288 with respect to the keyway in shaft 285, the lever 288 engaged by the middle of controller 218 having its key located centrally of the keyway, all those to the I right thereof against the lower side'of the key-- wardly to rock its respective lever 288 into a definite angular position, thereby rocking shaft '285 into a position determined by the angular relation existing between the lever 288 and the key- I way in shaft 285, which in turn is determined by which side of the controller depressed. 
 In the present example, the lever 2880 (Figures 130 and 14) aligned with the intermediate step 218a, of controller 218, has its key 282 located centrally in the keyway of shaft 285. and the lever 288B (Figure 138) aligned with the lower step 211 has its key. located against the top of said keyway, and the lever 288D (Figure 13D) in line with the upper step 218 has its key 282 located against the lower surface of the keyway in said shaft. 
 Figures 13A to 13E, inclusive, show control levers 288 positioned as they would be with the tabulator control'sub key stem 282 in line with lever 2880 (Figure. 130) latched down. 
 If the tabulator key in control of lever 288 positioned as shown in Figure 13A, hereinafter called order A, is now depressed, the roller 2l5 of order C will be retracted from lever 2880 by the key stem 282 of order C'being freed to rise 218 the key is under pressure of spring. 284 as described herelnbefore, and the roller 2l5 of order A will press 7 against the divergent side of 28I of control lever 288A to rotate said control'iever clockwise about shaft 285; 
Now in viewing lever 288A in Figure 12, which is from the left instead of the right as is the case of Figures 13A and 4,'this setting movement of lever 288A forces its'lateral extension 283 and arm 284 of lever 288B downwardly, which carries the controller 218 upward, thus rocking lever 288C and 288D counter-clockwise as viewed in Figure 12. Lever 288D (Figure 13D) represents the position of said lever before the. setting occurred; therefore this upward movement of controller 218 just referred to, forces lever 288D further'clockwise and the key 282 of said lever, being in the position shown in Figure 13D, rocks shaft 285 with it an equal amount. 
as was the case in the previous example. Therefore, it is evident from the foregoing that the depression of a tabulator key on one side of the controller 218 rocks shaft 285 in one direction, but the depression of a tabulator key on the other side of said controller rocks shaft 285 in the opposite direction; 3 
 Fixed on the end of shaft 285 (Figure 10) by means of a key of the same width as the keyway of the shaft, is a right end control lever.288 connected by a link 29! with a T member 282 pivotally mounted at 283 on the main' starting lever 248, the operation of which will be described If a tabulator key on the other side of controller'218 is depressed, for instance the one which controls order D (Figure 13D), the roller 2l8 of that order will be moved upwardly by said tabulator key, thereby rocking lever 288D counter-. 
' movement rocks said shaft an equal amount in a counter clockwise direction, instead of clockwise 7 hereinafter. As shaft 285 is rocked in one direction or the other, as just described, the T memher 282 will be rocked about its pivot 293 to carry one of its upper arms 284 and 295 over one of the ears 25l and 252 of shift operating lever 258 which, as hereinafter described, effects operation of the carriage shifting mechanism in one direction or the other, according to the direction in which the member 282 is rocked.- 
 Tabulator initiating mechanism The direction in which the carriage must be shifted in order to reach the desired position having been automatically determined, means are provided for initiating operation of the shifting mechanism to move the carriage to a desired position. As previously described, the depression of a tabulator key 288 to the position shown in having already positioned this lever. Therefore, 
when the key 288 is further depressed, the lever H5 is rocked further counter-clockwise and the rearwardly extending arm formed thereon (Figures 6 and 8) to which is pivoted by a pin 233 a trigger 231. A torsion spring 234 extends around the pin 233 and has one end thereof fitted in a notch in the trigger 231 while the other end thereof extends through a hole in the rear flange of the bail 235 so as to urge the trigger 231 clockwise about pin 233. On the rear side of said link. is the shoulder 238 adapted t1 engage the lower 1 edge of a lateral extension 261 (Figures 6 and 11) of starting interponent 268 which is rockably mounted on a fixed stud 282 and urged to rock in a counter-clockwise direction by a sprin 253 tensioned between an car 264 on the lower end of the interponent268 and a stationary stud (not shown). such movement being limitedby the bushin 281 fitted on the shaft 285. The upper edge of the lateral extension 26| abuts a shoulder 288 (Figure 11) formed one. lower toggle link 265, 
' also pivotally mounted on the stud 282. The upper end'of the link 255 is pivotally attached to an upper toggle link 288 by a stud 281, this upper toggfe link having an elongated hole 288 at its upper end which embraces a stud 242 on a starting lever 248. 
 The starting lever 248 is pivotally mounted on a fixed stud 243 attached to the frame of the machine, ,and is connected at the top of its upwardly extending arm 244 to one end of a tension spring 245, the lower end of which is securely fastened at a point (not shown) to the framin of the machine. The spring 245 thus tends to rock the starting lever 248 in a clockwise direction about the stud 243, but the lever 248 is normally restrained by the toggle link system comprising the upper and lower links 288 and 265, which, as illustrated in Figure 11, normally lie with the pivot pin 261 slightly to the left of center, with the upper end of the link 265 bearing against the sleeve 281 on the shaft 285. 
 When the tabulator bail 235 is rocked upon depression of a tabulator key 288 to its lowermost position, or upon depression of a value key I88, as will be described hereinafter, the trigger 231 is raised upwardly, and being held against the lateral extension 26I of the interponent 268 by the spring 234, rides along the surface of the extension-2H until its shoulder 239 abuts the lower edge of said extension, whereupon it rocks the interponent 288 clockwise about its stud 262. The extension 26I thus imparts a similar clockwise movement to the lower toggle link 265 (Figure 11), until the toggle link pin 251 is forced to the right of center, at which time the toggle link arrangement will collapse under the action of the tension spring 245, and the starting lever 248 will rock downwardly drawing with it the T member 292, which has been positioned over one of the ears 25I and 252, as previously described, so that said T member will contact one or the other of these ears of the operating lever 258 (Figures '1 and 16) to rock this lever and the shaft I485 pinned thereto either clockwise or counter-clockwise, thus actuating the shift controlling mechanism to shift the carriage 358 in the manner described hereinbefore under the section entitled Carriage shift controlling mechanism. 
 Means are provided to disable the tabulator. starting mechanism when the carriage occupies a position indicated by a depressed tabulator key. On the lower section of the control lever 298 (Figure 8) is riveted a stud 298 engaging in the slot 32I of a tabulator disabling lever 328, said disabling lever being freely rockable on a fixed frame stud 262, and provided with a nose 322 adapted to engage a stud 23I riveted to the trigger 231. When the carriage occupies a position indicated by the depressed tabulator key, the shaft 285 and control lever 288 are in their neutral positions and hold the disabling lever 328 in the position shown in Figure 8, where its nose 322 lies in the path of movement of the stud 23I Now, as the bail 235 is rocked counter clockwise in an attempt to initiate the tabulated shift, the trigger 231 is rocked counter-clockwise about its supporting stud 233 as the stud 23I rides over the nose of the disabling lever 328, thereby preventing contact of the shoulder 239 (Figure 6) of the trigger 231 with the lower edge of the ear 261 of the interponent 268. If the carriage is in any other position than that indicated by a depressed tabulator key, however, the shaft 285 and control lever 298, as previously described, will have been rocked clockwise or counterclockwise, thereby rocking the disabling lever 328 and moving its nose 322 out of the path of movement of the stud 23l, allowing trigger 231 to function normally to initiate a tabulated shift. 
lTabulator arresting mechanism previously described, in which the lever 288A and shaft 285 will have been rocked counterclockwise (viewing Figure 12 from the left); the control lever 288A being positively held by its roller 2I6 (Figure 4) and the shaft 285, being held in position by the difference in the three elevations of the steps of the controller 218, differentially positions the three levers 288' in contact therewith. 
 As the carriage and controller 218 traverse toward the controlling order (now order A) and the intermediate step 216a of-the controller moves into the bifurcation 216 of control lever 288A, the controller 218 will be forced downwardly by the difference in the elevation of the steps 211 and 216a, and will rock all control levers 288 to the right and left of lever 288A clockwise, as viewed in Figure 12. The shaft 285 thus will be freed by the levers 288 to the right of lever 288A and positively rocked clockwise by the control levers 288 to the left of lever 288A. This rocking of shaft 285 back to neutral functions to arrest the tabulated shift in a manner to be described hereinafter. 
 In order to permit this movement of shaft 285 to arrest the shifting mechanism, however, it is necessary to first restore and recock the starting lever 248 and means are therefore provided to recock this starting lever (Figure 11) by power derived from the motor and transmitted through the shift clutch during the first cycle of its operation. On the downwardly extending arm 24I of the starting lever is riveted a roller 248 positioned to engage in the hookshaped forward end of a lever 388 so that when starting lever 248 moves downwardly the lever 388 is rocked counter-clockwise about a shaft 3M, and, in turn, rocks a cam follower I341 clockwise about shaft 432 until roller I346, rivetedto the rear end of said cam follower, contacts the low surface of ,the cam I345 which is secured to the shift jack shaft I33I (Figure 15) and is rotated whenever the shift clutch operates. At approximately the same time the roller I346 contacts cam I345, said cam begins to rotate and rocks the cam follower I 341 counterclockwise and lever 388 clockwise, thereby forcing starting lever 248 to its raised position as shown in Figure 11'. The height of the cam I345 is preferably of such magnitude that the starting lever 248 will be substantially overcooked, and the elongated hole 286 is provided for such overcocking and to allow the toggle links 288 and 265 to be returned to the position shown in Figure 11 by the torsion spring 258. The cam I345 makes one-half revolution for each shift cycle; therefore, the starting lever 248 is recocked at half cycle or one-quarter revolution of shaft I33I, following which the starting lever 248 is permitted to lower the stud 242 until it seats in the bottom of the elongated hole 285, and the remainder of the cycle idly rotates cam I345 until its low point again underlies the roller If a tabulation is called for which will require six shift cycles before the tabulated position is reached, and the lever 248 is recocked during the first cycle, as just described, thus raising the the operating lever 250, the latter would, if 
allowed to return to its neutral position, stop the shift mechanism when only one' of the six required cycles had been completed. For this reason means have been provided to latch the operating lever 250 in its operative position until only a partial cycle of operation is necessary to reach the tabulated position, at which time the latch will be disengaged to free the lever 250 and stop the shift. 
 For this purpose, operating arm latch 305 (Fig. ure is rockably mounted onstud 202 and has an upwardly extending arm 306 on which is formed a lateral extension 301 adapted to engage a projection 253 of the operating arm 250, while on the other extension of latch 305 is a slightly flattened nose 309 which underlies the roller 290 of lever 290. A torsion spring 3I0 is provided to urge the latch 305 in a clockwise direction about stud 202 by the pressure of one of its ends against an ear 3 and the other end against a stud 3I6 on lever 3I5 (Figure '7). As described in detail hereinbefore, the end control lever290 (Figure 10) is rocked as soon as the tabulating controls are conditioned for a shift, 
and remains in that position until the tabulated wise or counter-clockwise from itscentral posisubsequent rocking of the operating arm 250 by T member 292 the projection 253 is raised or lowered from behind the lateral extension 301, allowing said extension to move to a position where it overlies or underlies the projection 253, thereby latching the lever 250 against return movement after the T member 292 is raised. 
 When the tabulated position has nearly been reached, however, the end control lever 290 returns to the position shown in Figure 10, causing its roller 296 to ride up the side of nose 309 and rock latch lever 305 counter-clockwise to remove lateral extension 301 from underneath or above the projection 253 and allow operating arm 250 to return to its neutral position under the urge of spring I400 (Figure 16), thus terminating the shift, as previously described. 
 The keys 200 comprise what is known in the art as a flexible keyboard wherein any latched down key 200 may be released by depressing any down key and then letting up on the second key before it has been depressed far enough to be latched down by the bar 2I3. Means are therefore provided to stop the carriage shifting operation if the same has been initiated by rocking of the bail 235 without setting one of the keys 200 in its latched down position, such as by depression of one of the value keys I00, as will be described hereinafter. If such procedure is followed, a spring 200 (Figure 10), tensioned between the lever'290 and the frame of the machine, will become effective to rock the shaft 205 in extreme counter-clockwise direction, as will be described hereinafter, to condition the tabulator mechanism for an automatic carriage shift to the left, the controller moving rightwardly. The only way to arrest such a tabulated shift is tion, and for this purpose, a stud 3I3 (Figure 14) is riveted to the center frame 3 of the machine a so as to lie in the path of the controller 210. 
The stud 3I3 is in the form of a cone, the 
5 upper side of which serves to' cam the controller 210 upwardly as it reaches its extreme right end position to effect rocking of the control lever 200 andthe shaft 205 to a neutral position as the controller 210 impinges upon its camming sur- Means are also provided to stop a rightward carriage shift which may be initiated by'de- 'pression of 'a tabulator key 200, followed by some misoperation, such as immediately depressing 15 another tabulator key 200 just enough to release the flrstkey, but not enough to latch the'second key down, and then allowing the second key to rise. with no tabulation key 200 depressed, no 
" control lever 200 will be positively held to stop a shift, and the drivingmechanism wouldjcone v.tinue town to attempt to shift the carriage beyond the right end position. Therefore, a stud 3I3a, similar to the stud 3I3 (Figure 14) is riveted to the left side frame, located in the path 5 of the controller 210, so as to cam the controller downwardly as it reaches. its extreme left hand position so as to stopthe shift driving mechanism. 
Keyboard and dial clearancemechanism As shown in Figure 1, in juxtaposition with I, each other are, a keyboard clear key I22, the depression of which releases all value selecting keys I00 which may be latched in a depressedposition, a middle dial clear key 313, the depression of which controls a clearing clutch to return to zero all accumulator dials 0 of the carriage 350,-and an upper dial clear key I9I0, the depression of which controls another clear mg clutch to return to zero all counter .dials I014 also provided on the carriage 350. 
 Situated at the front of the machine is a keyboard clear bail I25 (Figures 19, 20 and 24) having arms extending rearwardly at either end 5 thereof and pivoted on studs I26, fixedly mounted on the side frames of the machine. the arms I25 of the bail I25 (Figure 19) has a camming portion I21 formed thereon which is adapted to be engaged by a roller I24 carried on the key stem of the keyboard clear key I22 upon depression of this key. When it is desired to clear the keyboard, the key I22 is depressed, and on its downward movement, the roller I24 impinges the camming portion I21 of the clearbail I25 causing a tab I29 secured to the rearward surface of the bail I25 to engage all of the hereinbefore mentioned slidable locking slides M1 for the various value keys I00 to force the same rearwardly against the action of the various springs IIO, thereby releasing all depressed keys I00. 
 The accumulator and counter dials are cleared by power derived from the motor 040 (Figure 22) under control of the keys 313 and I9I0, respec- 5 tively, instead of manually as in thecase of the keyboard clear key I 22. 
 The upper dial" clear key I9I0 (Figure 21), by which the clearing or zeroizing of the counter dials I014 on the carriage 350 is effected, is secured to the upper end of a key stem 315 which is slidably mounted on a cross rod 314 and is pivoted at its lower end to bail 340 (Figures 21 and 25) by means of a bearing stud 31l, said bail being pivotally mounted on a shaft 344 supto rock the shaft 205 back to its neutral posiported in the various fixed plates of the ma-- One of cured to the framing of the machine, when it is moved forward by the bail 346. The rear end of the link 341 is connected to a bell crank 316, 
pivotally mounted on a stationary stud 311, and having a shoulder stud 313 secured to its upper end and adapted to be engaged by the bifurcated forward end of a clutch operating lever 319. This operating lever 319 is pivoted at 633 and is connected by a suitable bail 319' to a clutch dog "I which is normally held in position'to lock a clear clutch I9II.against rotation by a tension spring 362, extending between the lever 319 and a stud 382' mounted on the machine framing. 
 The clutch ISI I is of the well known cyclically operable type of clutches and similar to that shown in Figure 11 of U. S. Patent number 1,643,710 issued'to C. M. Friden to which reference may be'had for details thereof. 
From the foregoing it is evident that on depress'ion of the key. I9I3, the clutch dog 33I will be rocked counter-clockwise to release the clutch I! I, and upon engagement of this clutch rotation will be transmitted from a gear 36! (Figure 22) which is in mesh with the motor driven gear 641, through the clutch I9II to a cam I9I5 suitably secured to the driven side of the clutch I9II so as to impart a counter-clockwise rocking movement to a cam follower I9I6 pivoted at 365 and held against the cam bya spring I366 which is tensioned between the follower I9I6 and a pin 336 secured to the machine framing. The upper end of the cam follower I9I6 is connected by means of an arm I3I1 to a sleeve I9I3 which is splined to a carriagesupporting shaft 364, which shaft is Journaled in and laterally shiftable with the carriage. This shaft is therefore rocked by operation of the clutch I9I I, regardless of the position of the carriage, to effect return of all product dials to zero in a manner disclosed in the above mentioned Avery Patent No. 2,271,240. 
 In order to prevent continuous rotation of the clear clutch 363, in the-event that the bail 343 should be held in a clockwise position by the key H3 or by mechanism described hereinafter, the cam surface 345 on the link 341 rides up on the stud 343 as the bail 346 is being rocked clockwise, thereby camming the forward end of the link 341 upwardly to a position where the L-shaped aperture of the link will be moved to a position wherein the longitudinally extending opening thereof will be aligned with the pin 349, allowing the link 341 to be moved rearwardly under the action of the spring 333 until the clutch dog 33I contacts the housing of the clutch I9II on which it rides until the clutch completes its cycle. At this time the dog 3" drops into a recess on the clutch housing to disengage the clutch until the key I3I3 is again depressed. When the operator releases the clear key I9I3, its stem and ball 343 will be restored to its illustrated position by the spring 313, this restoration moving the stud 343 rearwardly until the link 341 can drop down to the position shown in Figure 21. 
.nection with the counter dials I314. 
 The accumulator dials 4I3 are cleared in a manner similar to that just described in con- The accumulator or middle dial clear key 313 is mounted on a key stem which is slidably supported in exactlythe same manner as the key stem 315 of the key I9I3, and is pivotally connected by means of a pin 433 to a bracket "I I (Figures 11 and 25) which is suitably welded to a bail 432, the latter being pivoted on the shaft 344 and connected to a clear clutch 363, identical to that of clutch I9I I, by linkage identical with that connected between the bail 343 and respective clear clutch I9I I. The engagement of clutch 363 by removal of the associated clutch dog I causes a cam 363 secured thereto to be rotated and to transmit a rocking movement to a cam follower 364 about the shaft 333. Cam follower 364 is connected by means of a link 331 to'an arm 368 secured to a sleeve 369 which is splined' to a second carriage supporting shaft 369 to return to zero all accumulator dials as described in detail in the Avery Patent No. 
Interlock: 
 When the tabulating shift initiating bail 333 (Figure 4) is rocked upon depression of one of the tabulator keys 233 or otherwise as described hereinafter, simultaneously with rocking of either or both of the clear bails 343 and 433, it is necessary to provide means for disabling the shift controlling mechanism until the clearance operations are completed. This means comprises, in the clear control train, arms 433 and 4330 (Figure 21) extending downwardly from the two identical bell cranks 313, either of which is adapted to restrain the shift controlling mecha- The shift control train includes the centralizer I433, the lower end of which is pivotally connected by a stud I4II to a link I4I2, the rearmost end of which has an elongated hole I4I4 formed therein and embracing a stud 43Ia sered to a bail 4320 which is pivoted at 4334. A forwardly extending arm of the bail 432a is attached to the lower end of a link 4340, the upper end of which is pivotally connected to an arm of an interlock 333 pinnedto a shaft 333 joumaled in suitable bearings, (not shown). A lateral extension 393 is formed on the upper end of the interlock 333 and is adapted to oooperate with the lower edge of either of the arms 433 and 43311 on thebell cranks 313. 
 When the tabulator shift operating bail 333 and either or both of the clear keys are simultaneously operated, the arms 433, 4330, or both, are lowered behind the lateral extension 333 at the beginning of a downward movement of one end or the other of the clear key 313 and "II to hold the interlock 393 against clockwise movement before either a shifting or clearing operation is initiated. As the keys are further depressed, the dogs 3" release the corresponding clear clutch or clutches to function at approximately the same time as the tabulated shift is tripped for initiation, which, as will be recalled from the previous'description, causes the T memher 332 (Figure 11) to drop on to one of the ears I and 252 of the operating arm 233 under the tension of spring 245, thus rocking arm m (Figure 16) and tending to rock the lever I313, thus centralizer I433 must be forced to the left, carrying with it link I! (Figure 21), The stud 43Ia, being at the right end of the elongated hole I4, is thus forced toward the left to effect a clockwise rocking of the bail 402a and thereby effect similar rocking of interlock 393. However, the arm 400 or 400a having been lowered behind the lateral extension 399 prevents this rocking of theinterlock 393 and restrains the movement of the shift train just described, back as far as the levers I490 and I49I (Figure 16), which compresses the spring I490 and thus functions to delay the shift operation until the clear clutch has completed its cycle. At this time the dog 38I (Figure 21) riding on the housing of the associated clear clutch drops into a recess therein, and the tension spring, as at 392, raises the arm 400 or 400a, or both, to the position shownin Figure 21. When both arms 400 and 4000 are clear of the interlock 393, the interlock will be free to rock clockwise under the action of the spring I490 and enable the shifting operation to start. Each of the levers 319 has a nose 383 depending therefrom and operable to rock a lever 395 about the shaft 386 to close a motor circuit for the motor 640 (Figure 22) in a manner disclosed completely in the Avery Patent No. 2,271,240. The interlock 393 also has a nose 391 thereon which is adapted to engage an ear 394 on the lever 305 for the same purpose. 
 Means are provided to allow the toggle links 265 and 289 (Figure 11) and the tabulator starting lever 240 to return to and be locked in their initial positions, even though the operator may be holding a tabulator key depressed after onehalf of the first shift cycle has been completed. The starting lever 240 (Figure 11), has, on the lower end thereof, a leftwardly extending projection 241 adapted to rock the trigger 231 counter-clockwise about its stud 233 by engaging the stud 23I, so that if the operator holds any of the keys 200 depressed, thus holding the trigger 231 in its upper position, the projection 241 on the end of lever 240 will force the trigger 231 out of engagement with the interponent 269 and allow this interponent to return to its extreme counter-clockwise position before the starting lever 240 is recocked, so as to prevent a repeated tripping of the starting lever 240. 
Tabulator controlled clearance initiating mechanism a In accordance with the present invention, means are provided for automatically effecting operation of any or all of the clearance mechanisms described in the preceding sections upon rocking of the tabulating shift initiating bail 235 by depression of any of the tabulator keys 200 or by depression of a value key I00, as will be described hereinafter. 
 Referring to Figures 11, 24 and 25, an automatic clearance initiating lever 404 is provided which is pivoted on a stationary stud 405 extending from the machine'framework and has a camming edge 406 formed on the upper surface thereof, and adapted to be engaged by a pin 401 on the starting member 240 as the same is rocked downward by the spring 245. v of the lever 404 overlies a reduced end portion of a stud .408 secured to a bail 409 which is pivoted on the shaft 344. A pin is carried-by an upwardly extending arm'of the bail 409 and has pivoted thereon, on either side of the arm bail 409, a pair of similar interponents 4H and M2. The interponent 4 has a pin 4I4'extending therefrom which is adapted to The forward endv lever. 
' is afllxed to this upwardly extending portion of the lever 4I5 to permit manipulationof this A projection H1 is also formed on the lever H5 and is engaged by a spring pressed ball 4| 9a carried in an aperture formed in a cross bar 9 which comprises part of the machine frame. The ball 4I8a thereby yieldably maintains the lever in either of two manually set positions. Apair of shoulders Mia and 4I5b are'formed on the lever 4l5 tolimit the movement of the same. I 
A tension spring 420 is interposed between a forwardly extending arm on the interponent 4H and a bracket 42I secured to the bail 409 to urge the interponent 4 in a counter-clockwise di-, rection into the position shown in Figure 11, to cause thepin 4| 4 to engage the adjacent camming surface of'the lever 5. Suitable means, such as a pin 499 extending through and projecting on both sides of the arm of bail 409, may be provided to prevent rocking of the interponents 4 or 2 in a counter-clockwise direc-. tion beyond that position illustrated in Figure 11. 
 Upon collapseof the toggle link arrangement comprising the links 255 and 288, due to rocking of the bail 235, the pin 401 engages the lever 404 to rock the same ina counter-clockwise ,direction, causing the forward end thereof to engage and rock the bail 409 clockwise causing the forwardly extending arm thereon to carry with itthe two interponents 4H and 2. With the lever 4| 5 in its illustrated position, the rearwardly extending arm of the interponent 4 is positioned by the spring 420 directly in front of the pin 3" which connects thekey stem 315 of the key I9I0 with .its respective bail 346. Thus, as the interponent 4 is carried rearward, it engages the pin 3H and rocks the bail 346 clockwise about the shaft 344 to initiate a clearing operation for the counter dials I014 in a manner described hereinbefore. If, however, the lever .4I5 is rocked into an extreme counter-clockwise position by manipulation of the handle 6, the camming surface MS of the lever 5 will rock the interponent 4 into such a position that the rearward edge thereof will be removed from juxtaposition with the pivot pin 31I. When in this position, subsequent rocking of the bail 409 by the lever 404 will cause the interponent 4| I to miss the pin 31I in its travel and thus prevent automatic clearing operation for the upper counter dials. a 
 The interponent 4 I2 is adapted to be selectively positioned to strike or miss a pin 424 formed on an upwardly extending arm 425 of the bail '402 in precisely the same manner as the interponent 4 is positioned. For this purpose, a lever 422 identical with that of H5 is provided adjacent the key stem 313 and has a handle 423 (Figure 1), mounted on a portion thereof extending through an opening in the keyboard cover plate 435 whereby it may be manipulated independently of the handle 6. w 
.The keyboard clearing mechanism may also be selectively conditioned to be automatically operbail 409. A pin 421 extends from the upper end 'of the interponent 429 and this interponent is be engaged by a camming edge formed on a urged in a clockwise direction by a spring 429
