GENERAL DESCRIPTION The instant invention is shown applied to the Ellis type of accounting machine, the basic principles of operation of which are so well known in the art that it is believed unnecessary to go into a detailed description thereof at this time. "Therefore. in this specification. only the mechanism pertinent to the instant invention will be described in detail. However, for a detailed description of the entire machine reference mav b had to the following United States Patents: Nos. 1,197,276 and 1.197.278. is ued Septemb r 5. 1916. to Halcolm Ellis: No. 1.203.863 issued November 7. 1916. to l-lalcolm Ellis: Nos. 1.939.804; 2,037.71": and 2.082.098 issued, respectivel December l9, 1933. April 28. 1936. a d June 1. 1937. to R. A. Christian, and No. 2,079,355 issued May 4, 1937, to Charles L. Lee. 
 While the present invention is shown embodied ir the well known Ellis type of accounting machine. it is not the intention to limit this invention to this particular machine, as it may easily be adapted for use in most any type of accounting machine. 
 The present machine has a plural ty of denominational rows of amount keys, which in adding operations position correspond ng actuators in proportion thereto. said actuators in turn positioning corresponding printing sectors and actuating the ,wheels of the selected totalizers to add therein the amount set up on the keyboard. The present machine is equipped with three adding totalizers and a consecutive number counting device. 
 The present machine is provided with a laterally shiftable traveling carriage, of the front feed type, in which the platen roll is rockable from printing position to front feeding position to permit the ready insertion of record material into the open throat thereof. The front feed throat comprises a guide table, which also serves as a line locating device for adjusting the record material in relation to the printing line. Adjustable stops. which protrude into the front teed throat, are also provided for locating certain types of record material in relation to the printing line. 
 The throat of the front feed platen may be opened manually at will, or may be arranged to open automatically in predetermined columnar positions of said traveling carriage. A locking device between the throat-opening mechanism and the machine-releasing mechanism prevents operation of the machine while the throat is open. 
 The traveling carriage is arranged to be tabulated manually or automatically from column to column by means of tabulating stop lugs, on control blocks adjustably mounted on said traveling carriage, in cooperation with tabulating stop bars and controlling means therefor. 
 The diflerent totalizers are selected and conditioned for addition by means of camming lugs, on the control blocks, in cooperation with hanging bar levers for the respective totalizers. 
 The repeat sub-total and total functions of the machine may be controlled manually by the depression of the required ones of a row of control keys, located on the left-hand side of the adding machine keyboard, or automatically by means of control tappets, mounted in predetermined columnar positions on the traveling carriage, which. in cooperation with associated mechanism, select the desired control keys and cause said selected control keys to be automatically depressed during machine operations. Likewise, control tappets adjustably mounted in predetermined columnar positions on the traveling carriage, in cooperation with associated mechanism, cause the machine to operate automatically, when said carriage is in said predetermined columnar positions. 
 Inasmuch as the traveling carriage, in predetermined columnar positions thereof, may be arranged to select the diflerent totalizers for their different functions, and to also cause the machine to cycle automatically, it is therefore evident that. by the proper arrangement of control tappets and control blocks, the machine may be arranged to perform a series of automatic operations to print the desired data on the various portions of the record material, corresponding to said predetermined columnar positions. 
 The machine embodying the instant invention is also provided with a selective carriage return mechanism, by means of which the carriage may be returned from tabulated position to starting position, or from predetermined columnar position to predetermined columnar position at the will of the operator. Also. when the traveling carriage reaches the end of its letter-spacing or working movement, the carriage return mechanism is automatically set in motion to return the carriage to starting position. 
 The present machine is provided with a full complement of typewriter keys for typing .the desired data in the various columns or portions of the record material, said typewriter keys, in 
cooperation with the usual escapement mechanism, causing the traveling carriage to letterspace in its working direction. The traveling carriage is urged in letter-spacing or working direction by means of a spring-actuated reel and a draw-band. 
 A certain one of the control blocks, on the traveling carriage, has a camming lug, which, in cooperation with a hanging bar lever, causes the two-color inking ribbon to be automatically shifted to print a certain item in a distinctive color. 
 In certain instances it is desirable not to have the machine cycle automatically, and to this end manual means has been provided for moving the tappets, which control this feature, to ineffective positions. 
 In the present construction, the three adding totalizers and the consecutive number totalizer are selected and conditioned for sub total operations by means of their respective sub-total control keys, and these totalizers are selected and conditioned for total operations by means of a total control key, used in conjunction with their respective sub-total control keys. 
 In order to prevent unauthorized persons from having access to the total key, a locked cover is provided for rendering this key inaccessible. 
 The mechanism described in general above, which is pertinent to the present invention, will now be described in detail. 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION Framework where the dot and dash lines of such framework do not shown behind the other parts, it indicates that such parts are in front of the framework. 
 The frames 40 and 4| are secured to a machine base 44, to which is also secured a case or cabinet 45 which encloses the mechanism of the machine. and which supports a laterally shiftable traveling carriage 46 later to be described. 
Operating mechanism The machine embodying the instant invention in driven by a conventional type of continuously running motor 39 (Fig. 3) supported by a framework 41, secured to the machine base 44. The armature shaft 48, of the motor 39, carries a worm wheel 49 which meshes with, and drives, a clutch driving member 50 free on a stud in the framework 41. Also free on the stud 5| and contained within a boring in the driving member 50, is a clutch driven member 52 carrying a stud 53 upon which is pivoted the lower end of a link 54, the upper end of which is free on a stud 55 in a drive arm 56. secured to a ma n drive shaft 51 Journaled in the frames 4|! and 4|. 
 A machine starting bar 58 has stems 59 and 60. parallel portions of which extend through and are guided by slots in a plate 6| mounted on the frame 40. The stem 59 is pivotally connected to a plate 62, free on a stud 63 in the frame 40. The plate 62 carries a stud 64 embraced by a bifurcated portion of one arm of a three-armed lever 65, free on a stud 66 in the frame 40, while the stem 60 is pivotally connected to an arm 61 of said lever 65. An arm of the lever 65 carries a stud 68 which cooperates with a shoulder on an having pivotally connected thereto one end of a pitman 1| the other end of which is bifurcated to straddle a stud 12 in the frame 48. The pit man 1| carries a stud 18 embraced by a slot in an upward extension of a lever 14 free on a stud 15 in the motor framework 41. 
 Depressing the starting bar 58 rocks the plate 82 and the lever 65 counter-clockwise and clockwise, respectively (Fig. 3), to move the stud 88 out of engagement with the shoulder on the arm 69. This frees the arm 89, pitman 1|, and lever 14, to the action of a torsion spring 16, which immediately rocks said lever 14 counter-clockwise to move a bent-over ear 11 thereof out of the path of the upper end of a clutch engaging lever 18, free on a'stu'd 19 in the clutch driven member 52. The lever 18 has adjustably connected thereto a plate 8|) carrying a stud 8|, to which is anchored one end of a clutch band 82, the other end of said band being secured to the clutch driven member 52. 
 Moving the ear 11 out of the path of the upper end of the lever 18 frees said lever to the action of a spring 83, which immediately rocks said lever 18 counter-clockwise to expand the clutch band 82 to cause said band to grip the inner surface of the continuously rotating clutch driving member 59, whereupon said driving member immediately rotates said driven member counter-clockwise in unison therewith. One revolution of the clutch driven member 52 (Fig. 3), by means of the link 54, oscillates the arm 56 and the main drive shaft 51, first counter-clockwise and back to normal position through an angle of approximately 60 degrees. 
 During return movement of the link 54 and the arm 56, a fiat surface 84 on a stud carried by said link, engages an upward extension 85 of the lever 14 and rocks said lever and the arm 69, clockwise to move the ear 11 into the path of the lever 18 and to move the shoulder on said arm 69beyond the stud 68. This permits a spring 86 to rock the plate 62 clockwise and. the lever 65 counter-clockwise, to return the stud 58 into the path of the shoulder or arm 69,to retain the ear 11 in the path of the upper end of the lever 18 when the stud 84 passes beyond the extension 85. Continued rotation of the clutch driven member 52 causes the upper end of the lever 18 to engage the ear 11 to contract the clutch band 82 to disengage the ciutch driven member from the clutch driving member to terminate machine operation. 
 The lever 18 is assisted in disengaging the clutch band 82 by a cam lever 81 free on a stud 88 in the motor framework 41. The lever 81 is urged clockwise by a compressible spring 89 to maintain a camming surface thereon in the path of a roller 96 mounted on an arm 91 secured to the clutch driven member 52. Near the end of rotation of the clutch driven member 52 the roller 96 engages the camming surface 95 to rock the lever 81 counter-clockwise to compress the spring 89, whereupon the declining portion of said camming surface, in cooperation with said roller, urges the c utch driven member 52 counter-clockwise to assist the lever 18 in contracting the clutch band 82, and retaining said band contracted. 
 Counter-clockwise engaging movement of the arm 69 and the lever 14 is limited by a downward projection 98 of the pitman 1| contacting the stud 18. One rotation of the clutch driven member 52 and one complete oscillation of the arm 56 and main shaft 51 drive the machine mechaarm free on a stud 10 in the frame "Landnism through one cycle of movement, which is the requisite for adding, total and sub-total operations. 
 The usual non-repeat mechanism of the type disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,142,341, issued to Charles H. Arnold, is provided for preventing repeat cycling of the machine, when the starting bar 50 is inadvertently retained depressed at the end of a machine operation. 
 Depressing the starting bar (Fig. 3) also renders mechanism effective which causes the traveling carriage 00 to be automatically tabulated from one columnar position to the next. This mechanism will be described later in connection with the complete description of the traveling carriage. 
 In addition to the regular starting bar 50, the machine also has a vertical feed starting bar 00 and an auxiliary starting bar I00. Depressing the bar 90 releases the machine for operation and causes the traveling carriage platen roll to be automatically rotated, to line-space the record material supported thereby, but does not initiate automatic tabulation of the traveling carriage. Depressing the auxiliary starting bar I00 initiates what is termed an idle operation of the machine in which the automatic rotation or line spacing of the platen and the automatic tabulation of the traveling carriage are rendered inoperative. The starting bars 99 and I00 will be described in detail later in connection with the traveling carriage. 
Amount keys Inasmuch as the different rows of amount keys and the mechanism associated therewith are substantially duplicated in each denominational order, it is believed that a description of the one row of amount keys shown in Fig. l, and the mechanism associated therewith, will be sufllcient for the purpose of this specification. 
 The row of amount keys IOI, shown in Fig. l, are assembled in a keyboard framework comprising a top plate I02, a partition plate I00, for each row of keys, and right and left side plates (not shown) said side plates being secured to the frames 40 and I. The upper ends of the keys IOI protrude through, and are guided by, corresponding openings in the top plate I02, while the lower ends of said keys are guided by square studs I05 therein, in cooperation with vertical slots I08 in the partition plate I00, for this particular bank. Each of the keys IOI has encircling the stem thereof a spring I00 compressed between a washer I01, integral with said key stems, and the bottom of an opening I08 in the plate I03. The springs I00 urge the keys IOI upwardly to compress felt washers I00 between the washers I01 and the top surfaces of the openings I00, said top surfaces being formed out of bent over portions of said openings I00 and having slots therein which admit the stems of the keys IN. The felt washers I09 deaden the sound when the amount keys are released by preventing a metal to metal contact between the washers I01 and the top of the openings I00. 
 Each row of amount keys has a detent plate II2 (Fig. 10) hinged on a rod, not shown, supported by the keyboard framework, said plates being spring urged counter-clockwise. 
 Depressing one of the keys IOI causes a bentover lip IIO on the lower end of the stem thereof to by-pass an angular lower edge III of the detent plate H2, whereupon said detent latches the key in depressed position. If another key is depressed, in the same row, the bent-over lip I I0 of said key rocks the plate II2 clockwise sufficiently to release the key previously depressed. thereby constituting what is termed flexible key action. 
 Mechanism is provided for automatically rocking the detent plates I I2 clockwise, near the end of adding operations, to release the-depressed amount keys. The forward ends of the plates I I2 extend within a corresponding notch in a bar I I0 mounted for horizontal shifting movement in the keyboard framework. The bar III has a bent-over portion IIO which engages an arm of a lever II5 pivoted on an extension of the frame 0|. The lever II! has another arm H0 which engages a notch in a key release pitman I I1 slidably mounted by means of parallel slots therein in cooperation with corresponding studs in the frame 0|. Pivotally mounted on the pitman H1 is a latch IIO urged counter-clockwise by torsion spring II! to normally maintain the lower surface of a hook-shaped projection I20 thereof in contact with a stud I2I in a disc I22 secured on the main shaft 01. 
 Initial movement clockwise of the shaft 51, as viewed in Fig. 10, causes the stud I2I to move beyond the hook I20, whereupon the spring II9 rocks the latch IIO counter-clockwise to move said hook I20 into the path of said stud I2I. Return movement counter-clockwise of the main shaft 51 causes the stud I2I to engage the hook I20 to shift the latch H8 and pitman II1 rearwardly. Rearward movement of the pitman III causes the notch therein in cooperation with the arm I I5 to rock the lever I I5 in unison therewith, causing the other arm of said lever, in cooperation with the bent-over portion H0, to shift the bar H3 toward the left, as viewed in Fig. 10. Shifting movement of the bar I I3 rocks the plates II2 clockwise to disengage the angular edges III from the bent-over lips IIO of the depressed keys IOI to release said keys, which are immediately returned to undepressed positions by the springs I00. 
 After rearward shifting movement of the latch H0 and the pitman II1 has released the depressed amount keys, an upward extension I20, of said latch, engages a stud I24 in the frame 0| and rocks said latch I I0 clockwise to disengage the hook I20 from the stud I2I, whereupon the pitman I I1 and latch I II! are spring-returned a short distance forwardly so that the lower surface of the hook I20 will come to rest on top of the stud I2I. The notches in the bar II! are large enough to permit free movement of the plates I I2 when the amount keys are depressed. 
 In the present machine the amount key releasing mechanism functions as described above, in adding operations. In sub-total and total operations, mechanism, not here shown but fully disclosed in the U. S. Patent No. 1,203,863 refered to above, operates the key releasing mechanism at the start of said operations, to release any amount keys that have been inadvertently depressed. 
 Manual means is also provided for releasing the depressed amount keys, said manual means including a release key I25 (Figs. 10 and 13), the undercut upper and lower ends of the stem of which fit in corresponding slots in an auxiliary keyboard plate I26 and a bracket I 21 both of which are mounted on the frame H. A compressible spring I20 urges the key I25 upwardly to normally maintain a shoulder, formed by the undercut upper end thereof, in contact with the bottom of the plate I20. They key I25 carries a stud I29 (Fig. 13) upon which is pivoted one end of a link I30, the otherend of which is bifurcated to straddle a stud I8I in the pitmani I1. 
 Depressing the release key I25, by means of the link I30, moves the pitman II1 rearwardly to rock the lever II5 to shift the bar II3 toward the left to release the amount keys in the manner explained earlier herein. The bifurcated end of the link I30, in cooperation with the stud I3 I, permits the pitman I I1 to shift rearwardly independently of the release key I25, when the automatic key releasing mechanism functions. 
 Calling attention to Fig. 1, depressing any one of the keys I I, except the 9 key, moves the square stud I therein into the path of a corresponding one of a series of graduated steps I32 on an actuator rack I33, for this particular amount bank, a notched portion of the forward end of which fits in a corresponding slot in a rod I34, supported by the frames 40 and 4|, and the rearward end of which is bifurcated to fit a corresponding slotted portion of a bar I35 also supported by the frames 40 and 4|. It is, therefore, evident that the actuator I33 is mounted for horizontal reciprocating movement, which is imparted thereto in a manner presently to be described. 
 Depressing any one of the amount keys IOI also moves a zero latch (not shown), which retains the actuator I33 in zero position, when no amount key is depressed, to ineffective position. There is no corresponding step I32 on the actuator I33 for the stud I05 in the 9 key, and depression of this key merely releases the zero latch and the rack travels the full distance rearwardly until a wall I36 formed by the notched forward end thereof, contacts the rod I34. 
 The actuator I33 has a vertical slot I31 which straddles a stud I38 in a segmental portion I39 of a reducer arm I45, free on a shaft I46 journaled in the frames 40 and M. Aspring I41, tensi d 18.13 the segment I39 and a leading bar I48 extending between two similar arms I49, only one here shown, secured on the shaft I 46, normally maintains a projecting portion of the segment I39 in yieldable contact with the leading bar I48. 
 When the arm 56 (Fig. 3), is oscillated, in the manner explained earlier herein, a roller I50, carried thereby, in cooperation with an irregular camming slot I5I in a cam plate I52, secured on the right-hand end of the shaft I46, rocks said shaft, the arms I49 (Fig. 1) and the leading bar I48 first rearwardly or counter-clockwise and then back to normal position through an invariable excursion during each machine operation. Initial movement rearwardly, or counter-clockwise, of the leading bar I48, by means of the spring I41 (Fig. 1), causes the segment I39, the reducer arm I45, and the actuator I33 to travel in unison therewith, until such movement of said actuator is terminated by one of the steps I32 thereon, contacting the stud I05 in the depressed amount key IN. This positions the actuator and the reducer arm I45 in proportion to the de pressed amount key, and the leading bar I48 completes its rearward movement independently of the segment I39, flexing the spring I41. 
 Initial movement counter-clockwise of the reducer arm I45, by means of a link II52 (Figs. 1 and 21), connected betweenan arm I53 of said reducer arm and a printing sector I54, for this particular amount bank, positions said printing sector in proportion to the depressed amount key. The printing sector I54 is pivotally mounted on an arm I55 free on a printer shaft I56 journaled in the printer framework and the frame 40. The'arm I55 is connected to a release and anti-rebound plate I51 also free on the shaft I56 and a spring I58, tensioned between a bail I59 secured on the shaft I56 and a pawl I60 connected between the arm I55 and plate I51, urges said plate, said arm and the printing sector I54 clockwise. However, such movement of these partsis restrained by a tooth on the plate I51 in cooperation with a tooth I6I on a zero elimination pawl I62, free on a rod I63 supported by the printer framework, said pawl being urged clockwise by a spring I64 into engagement with said plate I51. 
 Initial movement counter-clockwise of the reducer arm I45 causes a stud I65 in an extension thereof, in cooperation with an arcuate surface I66 on an extension of the pawl I62, to rock said pawl counter-clockwise out of engagement with the tooth of the plate I51. Each zero elimination pawl I62 has a bent-overear I61 which overlies a surface I68 on the next higher order zero elimination pawl, thus providing a medium through which all the lower order pawls I62 are moved to ineffective positions to release the cormain shaft 51, is connected by a link I69 to an arm I10 pivotally connected to an arm I1 I integral with a hub I12 secured on the printer shaft I56. Two springs I13, stretched between the arms I10 and HI, urge said arm I10 into contact with the hub I12 and form a yieldable connection between said arms I10 and HI. Initial movement counter-clockwise of the arm 56, by means of the link I69 and arms I10 and Ill, rocks the shaft I56 and the bail I59 (Figs. 1 and 21) clockwise to increase the tension of the spring I58, and moves a rod I14, supported by the arms of the yoke I59, away from an inclined surface I15 of the plate I51. 
 After the actuator I33 and the printing sector I54 have been positioned, continued clockwise movement of the shaft I56 causes a projection I42, on the arm 603 (Fig. 21), to engage an adjusting screw I43 in a plate I44 secured to the latch I40, to rock said latch counter-clockwise, 
Directing attention to Fig. 1, after the leading bar I48 has completed its initial movement rearwardly to cause the actuator I33, arm I45 and printing sector I54 to be positioned, a roller I18 (Fig. 3) mounted on the same axle as the roller I50, said axle being supported by the arm 56, 
in cooperation with a cammlng groove I19 in an arm I88 flexibly connected to an allner shaft I6I joumaled in the frames 48 and 4I, rocks said shaft clockwise, near the end of the initial movement counter-clockwise of the arm 88. Secured on the shaft I8I (Fig. 1), and moving in unison therewith, are two arms I82, only one here shown, supporting a cross bar I88 having secured thereto an alining bar I84, which upon clockwise movement of said shaft I8I engages the proper one of a series of teeth I86 cut in the periphery of the segment I89, to aline said segment, the printing sector I54 and the actuator I38 while printing is being effected, and while the totalizers are being engaged with said actuator, in adding operations. 
 After printing has been effected, return movement clockwise of the arm 56 (Fig. 3) causes the roller I18, in cooperation with the cam groove I19, to rock the shaft I8I counter-clockwise to normal position to disengage the aliner I84 (Fig. 1) from the segment I39. Continued return movement clockwise of the arm 56 causes the roller I58 in cooperation with the cam slot I5I to return the shaft I46 and the leading bar I48 clockwise. During its return movement the leading bar I48 picks up the reducer arm I45 and returns said arm, the printing sector I54, and the actuator I38 forwardly to normal or zero position, as shown in Fig. 1, where the zero latch again becomes effective to retain said actuator and connected parts, in zero position. 
 Return movement clockwise of the arm 66 and the shaft 51, by means of the link I68 (Fig. 3), also returns the printer shaft I56 and the bail I59 counterclockwise, causing the rod I14 (Fig. 1), in cooperation with the surface I15, to return the plate I51, arm I55 and printing sector I54 to normal positions, as here shown, whereupon the tooth I6I of the pawl I62 reengages the tooth of the plate I51 and the release latch I48 reengages the tooth MI in preparation for the succeeding operation. 
Totalizers The machine embodying the present invention has four totalizers, numbered 1 to 4, respectively (Fig. 1), assembled in vertical pairs at the rear of the machine. The #1 and #2 totalizers are mounted in a framework I86, secured to the main frames 48 and 4i, and two plates I81, only one here shown, connect the framework I86 to a framework I88, which supports the #8 and #4. totalizers. Each of the four totalizers has a single set of wheels, adapted to be actuated by their corresponding actuators I33 and extensions I98. 
 In the present adaptation the #3 totalizer is used as a consecutive number device and is advanced step by step in a manner later to be described. 
 Wheels I89 and I95 of the #1 and #2 totalizers, corresponding to the denomination illustrated in Fig. 1, are arranged to cooperate respectively with rack teeth on the upper and lower surfaces of the bifurcated portion of the actuator I88. Wheels I96 and I91 of the #3 and #4 totalizers are adapted to cooperate respectively with teeth on the upper and lower surfaces of the bifurcated portion of an extension I98 connected to the actuator I33 and supported by a slotted bar I99 mounted in the framework I88. 
 The #1, 2 and 4 totalizers are adding totalizers, and taking the #1 totalizer as an example, after the leading bar I48 (Fig. 1) has completed its initial movement rearwardly and the actuator I88 has been positioned by the depressed amount key Ill, mechanism, controlled by the traveling carriage and presently to be described, causes the wheel I88 to be engaged with the actuator I88 and return movement forwardly of said actuator, under the influence of the leading bar I48, rotates said wheel I88 in a clockwise direction to add therein the value of the amount set up on the depressed amount key "I. when the wheel I88 passes through zero, one of two diametrically opposed teeth on a tripping cam 288, integral with said wheel, engages the tooth of a tripping pawl 28I and rocks said pawl clockwise to unlatch the carry mechanism, which causes the wheel of the next higher order to be advanced one step. Further description of the carry or transfer mechanism is believed unnecessary, as this mechanism is old and is well known in the art and is shown and described in the above-named Patent No. 1,197,276. After the actuator I88 has completed its return movement forwardly, in adding operations, the #1 totalizer is rocked out of engagement therewith. 
 In total and sub-total operations the .wheel I88 of the #1 totalizer is rocked into engagement with the actuator I88 prior to the initial movement rearwardly of said actuator, which movement reversely rotates said wheel to zero position, which position is determined by one of the diametrically opposed teeth on the tripping cam 288 coming into contact with the pawl 28I. This positions the wheel I89, the actuator I88, and the printing sector I84 in accordance with the amount standing on said wheel, after which functioning of the printing mechanism causes this amount to be recorded on the record material. 
 In total operations the wheel I88 is rocked out of engagement with the actuator I88 prior to its return movement forwardly, and consequently said wheel remains in a zerolzed condition. In sub-total operations the wheel I88 remains in engagement with the actuator I88 during its return movement forwardly, and consequently is returned to its original position. 
 The totalizer engaging mechanism will be explained more in detail later in connection with the traveling carriage mechanism. 
Traveling carriage The traveling carriage 48 (Fig. 1) is supported for horizontal shifting movement on the case 46 by means of corresponding ways 282 and 288 mounted respectively near the rear of the traveling carriage and the case, said ways having therebetween ball bearings 284, which reduce friction and insure accurate allnement of the platen I11 with the printing mechanism. The front of the traveling carriage is shiftably supported by means of rollers 285, carried thereby, in cooperation with a rail 286, mounted on the case 48. A series of rollers 281 on the carriage, in cooperation with a recessed or horizontally grooved portion of the rail 286, prevents the front of the traveling carriage from tilting upwardly and a series of brackets 288 secured to the frame of the traveling carriage, in cooperation with a flanged portion of the way 288, prevents the rear of the traveling carriage from tilting upwardly. 
 The platen roll I11 is mounted in a rockable framework which in turn is supported by the traveling carriage framework 46, and said platen is adapted to be rocked from printing position, as shown in full lines in Fig. 1, to a more accessible position, sometimes referred to as openthroat position and shown in dot and dash lines, for the front-feeding of record material therearound. When the platen I'll is rocked to, frontfeeding position a plurality of pressure rollers 209 are moved out of engagement with said platen and a front-feed guide chute 210 is rocked forwardly to an inclining position, as shown in dot be opened manually or automatically, the latter being controlled by tappets located in predetermined columnar positions of the traveling carriage. The-usual mechanism (not here shown) locks the machine against operation when .the platen I1! is in front feeding position. The above mechanism is fully described in the co-pending application, Serial No. 653.838, filed January 27, 1933, by R. A. Christian. 
Escapement mechanism Referring to Figs. 1 and 18, the traveling carriage 46 is constantly urged in a letter spacing, working or tabulating direction by the usual spring-actuated reel (not shown) and its associated draw band I9i, one end of said draw band being connected to' a stud I92 in the framework of the carriage 46. The traveling carriage is normally restrained against movement in a work- 1 ing. direction, under influence of the springactuated reel and the draw band 'l 91, by the well known escapement mechanism shown in Figs. 16 and 17 andnow to be briefly described. 
 Mounted on the framework 46 crime traveling carriage and parallel to the direction of travel of said carriage, is a rack 214. which meshes with a pinion 2l5 secured on the upperend of a'vertical shaft2i6 (Figs. 1, 16*and l7), journaled in abushing 2" which extends through an opening in the case and issecured in the cross frame 43. Secured to the lowerend of "the shaft 2! 6 is an escapement ratchet 2I9,'1",the teeth of which cooperate with an escapementfipawl 2l9 'freeon. 
a stud 220 secured in) the frame; Also free on thestud 220 is anes'capement operating and control plate 22 I, which supports atorsion-spring 222, tensioned to urge the escapement pawlfla counter-clockwise into engagement .withthe teeth of the ratchet 219 untilsuchmovement' is terminated by an extension of said pgw1 contacting an eccentric 223, mounted-;;on. thefplate, 221. The eccentric 223 provides :m'eanslforj adjusting the escapement pawl 2i9 in-relationto the-teeth of the ratchet 2l8 'and alsoforldiseng'aging said pawl from-said ratchet, when-lthe escapement mechanism functions, in a' ma'nner presently :to' 
be described.

A hole in the lower end of the lever 228 flts freely one. stud |23l extending between two arms of a-yoke 232 fulcrumed on studs 233 in a bracket 234 pivotally mounted on two trunnions 235, in a recessed portion of the frame 43. 
 The machineembodying the instant invention has a typewriter attachment consisting of a full complement of typewriter keys, a representative one (239) of whichis shownin Fig. 16. The key lever236is free on a rod 23'! supported by the base [44 (Fig. 13), and said key lever carries a stud'298 which cooperates, with a camming slot in a type and escape'mentloperating lever 239 free on a rod nd. i 
 Depressing the typewriter key 239, by means of the stud 238 in cooperation with the camming slot in the lever 239, rocks said lever counterclockwise, as viewed in'Fig. -17, causingsaid lever, 
in cooperation witha universal bar 242,.retained in slots in the forward ends of the two arms of the yoke 232, to shift said yoke, the bracket 234, and the lever .228 forwardly or clockwise (Fig .17). Clockwise movement of the lever 228 shifts the rod 225 rearwardly, thereby rocking the plate 22l clockwise as viewed in Fig. 16. Clockwise movement of the plate 22l causes the eccentric 223 to disengage thetooth of the pawl 2l9 from the teeth of the escapement ratchet 2l8 to per .i

A right angled portion ofthe plate 22! (Fig. 16) has a hole therein into which, 
fits loosely one end of a rod 225, the othe'rgend of which is secured to' a bracket 22 6:fulcr'umedon a stud 221 ina lever 229 pivoted on a-{stud 229 in .the frame 43. A spring 230, tensioned between the stud mand the late 221 'norrnally I l9l. Clockwise movement of the plate 22L (Fig. 
18) also rocks the tooth of the pawl 224 into the Typewriter tabulating mechanism A manipulative lever 24! (Figs. 10 and 18), usually referred to as the typewriter tabulating lever," is provided for .tabulatingthe traveling carriage to predetermined columnar position. The typewriter tabulating lever 246 (Fig. 10) terminates in a finger-piece 244, conveniently located in relation to the typewriter keyboard. 
 Depressing the tabulating lever 246 causes the rearward end thereof (Fig. 18), in cooperation with a notched portion of a lever 24'! free on a stud 243 in the frame42 (Fig. 18), to rock said lever counter-clockwise as here viewed. Counterclockwise movement of the lever 24! causes a hook-shaped projection thereof, in cooperation with the rounded end of ..a lever 249 free on a stud, 250 in the frame 42, to rock said lever clockwise against the action of a spring 25I,- 
which normally maintains a flat portion of said lever, 249 in contact with the bottom of a pad .252 on the frame 42. Clockwise movement of -the lever 249 causes a downward surface 243 thereof, in cooperation with a pin 253 (Figs. 17 
maintains said pl'atein contactwith an able collar 231 free on the rod225' andeldaptedi' to be'adjusted-Jhy' an adjusting nut and itsassociated locknut. assembled on a threaded portion tically in a slot inthe frame 42, to move said plunger downwardly. An aperture in the plungex 254 embraces an extension of a lever 255 free Ion a stud 259 in a bracket 251 secured to the frame 42, from which it-is apparent that down- 245 supported bythe frames 40 ward movement of the plunger 254 rocks the lever 255 counter-clockwise as here viewed. 
 Counter-clockwise movement of the lever 255, by means of a link 258 comiecting said lever to one arm of a three-armed lever 259 free on a stud 268 in the frame 43, rocks said lever 259 clockwise against the action of a spring 26L A link 262 (Figs. 16 and 17) connects an arm of the lever 259 to an arm of a yoke 263 free on a rod 264 supported by downward extensions of the frame 43. Therefore, clockwise movement of the lever 259 is transmitted to the yoke 263 causing an extension 265 thereof, in cooperation with a projection 266 (Fig. 16) of the escapement pawl 2l9, to rock said pawl clockwise out of engagement with the teeth of the ratchet 218. This releases the travelin carriage 46 (Figs. 1 and 18) to the action of the spring reel and the draw band I91, which immediately moves said carriage toward the left in a working or tabulating direction. 
 Clockwise movement of the lever 249, as viewed in Fig. 18, and counter-clockwise movement of said lever, as viewed in Fig. 27, withdraws a rounded nose, on an extension thereof, from a square stud 261 in a tabulating stop bar 268 mounted to shift vertically by means of slots therein in cooperation with screw studs 269 in the frame 42. This releases the plunger 268 to the action of a spring 218, which shifts said plunger upwardly to move the upper end 21! thereof into the path of a projection 212 of a typewriter tabulating stop 213 slidably mounted on a tabulating stop bar 214 secured to the traveling carriage 46. The projection 212 contacting the upper end of the plunger 266 moves the stop 213 into engagement with a stationary control block 385, also mounted on the bar 214, to terminate tabulating movement of the traveling carriage. After tabulating movement of the carriage has been terminated, releasing the tabulating lever 246 permits the spring 261 (Fig. 17) to return the lever 259 and the yoke 263 counter-clockwise to withdraw the extension 265 of said yoke from the projection 266 (Fig. 16) of the pawl 2i9 to permit the torsion spring 222 to return said pawl into engagement with the teeth of the ratchet 2 l 8, to hold the traveling carriage against further tabulatin movement. Also, releasing the typewriter tabulating lever 246 (Fig. 18) causes the spring 25! to return the lever 249 counter-clockwise to normal position. as here shown, to move the stop bar 268 downwardly out of the path of the stop 213, so that said stop will not interfere with subsequent movement of the traveling carriage in its working or tabulating direction. 
Accounting machine tcbulatinq mechanism Tabulating mechanism entirely independent of the typewriter tabulating mechanism just described, and usually referred to as the accounting machine tabulating mechanism is provided for tabulating the traveling carriage to various columnar positions. Initiating machin operation by depressing the starting bar 58 (Fig. 3) causes the accounting machine tabulating mechanism to function automatically, or said tabulating mechanism may be operated manually by depressing a tabulating key 215, located on the righthand side of the accounting machine keyboard between the vertical feed and auxiliary starting bars 99 and I88. A manipulative lever 216 (Fig. 3), one end of which protrudes through a slot in the keyboard plate 63, is provided for rendering the automatic tabulating mechanism effective or inefiective at will. 
 Directing attention to Fig. 3, pivotally mounted on the link I69, which operates the printer shaft I56. is a tabulating hook 211 urged clockwise by a spring 218, to normally maintain a bent-over projection or ear 219 thereof in contact with the edge of said link 169. As previously explained, a machine operation consists of one oscillation of the arm 56, initial movement counter-clockwise of which raises the link I69 causing the hook 211, under certain conditions, to latch over a stud 288. secured in one end of a tabulatmg lever 28l pivoted on a stud 282 in the frame 48. However. the stud 288 is normally protected from engagement by the hook 211 by a footshaped extension 283 of a lever 284 pivoted in a slot in a stud 285 secured in the frame 48. A spring 286 urges the lever 284 toward the left to normally retain the foot-shaped extension 283 in the path of the hook 211, whereupon said hook rides idly over the sole of the foot 283, during up-and-down movement of the link i69, without engaging the stud 288. 
 However, depressing the starting her 58 causes the lever 284 to be rocked toward the right, in the manner explained in the beforementioned Patent $2,082,098, to move the foot 283 out of the path of the hook 211, whereupon upward movement of the link I69 causes said hook to latch over the stud 288. and downward movement of said link causes the hook 211, in cooperation with the stud 288, to rock the lever 28! clockwise, until said hook rides off of said stud. Clockwise movement of the lever 28! causes the traveling carriage to tabulate, as will be explained presently. 
 The lever 28! (Figs. 3, 26 and 27) has a slot 281 into which extends one end of a lever 288 pivoted on a stud 289 in the frame 42. The other end of the lever 288 underlies the rounded nose of a lever 295 free on a stud 296 in the frame 42 and urged counter-clockwise by a spring 291, which normally maintains a raised surface 298 on said lever 295 in contact with the bottom surface of a pad 293, a slotted portion of which supports the plunger 254. A stud 299 (Fig. 26) in the lever 295 extends within a slot in a tabulating stop bar 388, loosely contained in a vertical slot 294 in an enlarged portion of the frame 42. A torsion spring 38!, in cooperation with a stud 382 in the stop bar 388, urges said bar upwardly to normally maintain the bottom of the slot in said bar in contact with the stud 299. 
 Clockwise or downward movement of the lever 28! (Figs. 3, 26 and 27), under influence of the hook 211, as explained above, causes the slot 281 therein to rock the levers 288 and 295 counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively, against the action of the spring 291. Clockwise movement of the lever 295 permits the spring 38I, in cooperation with the stud 382, to raise the stop bar 388 upwardly to move a left-hand projection 383 thereof into the path of a stopping lug 384 on the control block 385, adiustably mounted on the stop bar 214 (see also Fig. 18). Clockwise movement of the lever 295 causes a square stud 386 (Fig. 26), carried thereby, to move beyond the latching surface of a latch 381, pivoted on a stud 388 in the frame 42, whereupon a torsion spring 889 rocks said latch clockwise into the path of the stud 386 to obstruct return movement counter-clockwise of the lever 295, when the hook 211 rides off of the stud 288 (Fig. 3), in the manner explained above. 
 Upon clockwise movement of the latch 381, a hump 292 thereon, in cooperation with the right edge of the stop bar 388, rocks said bar toward the left, as viewed in Fig. 26, into contact with the left wall of the slot 204. Clockwise movement of the lever 295 causes an enlarged surface 29| thereof. in cooperation with the stud 253 (Fig. 27), to rock the escapement plunger 254 downwardly, causing the mechanism shown in Figs. 16 and 17 to disengage the escapement pawl 2|9 from the ratchet 2|0, to free the traveling carriage for tabulating movement, which is effected in the manner explained earlier herein. 
 The stud 302 (Fig. 27) extends through an aperture 3|0 in an escapement control bar 3 mounted in the vertical recess 294, adjacent the tabulating bar 300. A spring 3|2 urges the bar 3 toward the left, as here viewed, to normally retain one surface of a notch 3|6 therein in contact with a square stud 3|3 in an arm 3|4 pivotally mounted on the frame 42 and spring-urged clockwise into engagement with a stop stud 3|5. A stud 3| 1 pivotally connects the lower end of the bar 3 to an escapement control lever 3|8, similar in outline to the lever 295 and pivotally mounted adjacent thereto on the stud 296. A torsion spring 3|9 urges the lever 3|8 counterclockwise to normally maintain a raised surface thereon, similar to the surface 298 on the lever 295, in contact with the pad 293. 
 Upward movement of the bar 300 (Figs. 26 and 27), as explained previously, causes the stud 302, in cooperation with the aperture M0, to carry the bar 3 upwardly in unison therewith, until a recessed portion of the notch 3|6 latches over the stud 3I3. Upward movement of the bar 3 rocks the lever 3|8 clockwise and an enlarged surface thereon similar to the surface 29| on the lever 295, in cooperation with the stud 253, and through the medium of the notch 3|6 and stud 3|3, retains the escapement mechanism disengaged, after the bar 300 and its associated lever 295 have been returned to normal positions, in a manner and for a purpose presently to be described. 
 When the escapement mechanism is rendered ineffective, as explained above, the spring actuated reel and the draw band |9| immediately move the traveling carriage in a tabulating or working direction, which is toward the left, as viewed in Fig. 18, and toward the right as viewed in Fig. 27. Tabulating movement of the traveling carriage is terminated by the stopping lug 304 on the control block 305 (Fig. 27) contacting the projection 303 and carrying the stop bar 300 a slight distance clockwise or toward the right against the action of the torsion spring 309 until said stop bar contacts the right-hand wall of the recess 294. The projection 303 of the bar 300 being slightly longer than a similar projection 320 on the bar 3| I, which is moved into the path of the lug 304 when said bar 3| moves upwardly, protects said projection 320 from the stop lug 304, and therefore the notch 3|6 remains engaged with the stud 3|3. Clockwise movement of the bar 300 (Figs. 26 and 27), in cooperation with the hump 292, rocks the latch 30'! counter-clockwise to disengage said latch from the stud 306 to release the lever 295 and the bar 300 to the action of the spring 291. r 
 Abruptly terminating the tabulating movement of the traveling carriage, in this manner, causes said carriage to rebound a slight distance, at which time the spring 29! returns the lever 295 and the bar 300 counter-c1ockwise and downwardly respectively, to move the projection 303 out of the path of the stop lug 304. The bar 3| l, 
which is still retainedin its upward position, in 
cooperation with the lever 3! (Fig. 27), continues to hold the plunger 254 in its downward position to retain the escapement mechanism in ineffective position. 
 Rebounding movement of the traveling carriage causes the stopping lug 304 to engage the projection 320 to rock the bar 3 clockwise out of engagement with the stud 3|3, whereupon the spring 3|9 immediately returns said bar downwardly and the lever 3| 8 counter-clockwise to normal positions, as here shown. Counterclockwise return movement of the lever 3! permits the escapement plunger 254 (Figs. 16, 17 and 2'!) to return upwardly, under influence of the spring 26l, to rock the yoke 263 counter-clockwise to normal position-as here shown, to move the extension 265, of said yoke, out of engagement with the projection 266 of the escapement pawl 2I9, to permit said pawl to reengage the teeth of the ratchet 2|8 to hold the traveling carriage against further tabulating movement. 
 From the foregoing description it is evident that initiating machine operation by depressing the motor bar 58 (Fig. 3) causes the lever 28| to be rocked clockwise by the hook 211 to automatically tabulate the traveling carriage. 
 As previously stated, the accounting machine tabulating mechanism may be operated manually by depressing the key 215. Depressing the key 215 causes a stud 32| in the lower end thereof, in cooperation with a shoulder 322 on an arm 323 plvotally' connected to the lever 28| and urged counter-clockwise or forwardly by a sprin 324, to normally maintain a bentover car thereof in contact with the lower surface of said lever 28|, to rock said lever clockwise to cause the traveling carriage to tabulate in exactly the same manner as explained above. After the lever 28| has been rocked a. suilicient distance clockwise to render the tabulating mechanism effective, the stud 32| rides oil? of the shoulder 322, rockin the arm 323 clockwise against the action of the spring 324. This permits the lever 28| to return counter-clockwise to normal position in case the tabulating key 215 is retained depressed, and when said tabulating key 215 is released it is spring-returned upwardly during which movement the stud 32| by-passes the shoulder 322 and the parts come to rest in the positions shown in Fig. 3. 
 Angular camming surfaces on the tops of the bars 300 and 3|! (Figs. 26 and 2'7) permit the stop lugs 304 to by-pass said bars, in case the traveling carriage is accidentally returned toward the left, as here viewed, after said bars have been moved upwardly into the path of said stop lugs 304. 
 As previously explained, the accounting machine tabulating mechanism may berendered effective or ineffective for automatic operation by the manipulative lever 216 (Fig. 3) which is con veniently located on the right-hand side of the keyboard. When this lever is in its rearward position. as here shown, the automatic tabulating mechanism is effectiveand functions when the motor bar 58 is depressed. Moving the lever 216 forwardly renders the automatic tabulatin mechanism ineffective at all times irrespective of whether the motor bar 53 is depressed or not. 
 If a more complete description is desired of the lever 216 and the mechanism connecting the motor bar 58 to the control lever 284 reference may be had to the Christian Patent No. 2,082,098. 
Adding operations The Nos. 1, 2 and 4 totalizers are selected for addition by means of add hanging bar levers in cooperation with corresponding tappet lugs on a series of control blocks, one of which (335) has been previously described, located in the various columnar positions of the traveling carriage on the stop bar 214 (Fig. 18). In the present adaptation the #3 totalizer is used as a consecutive number device and the hanging bar lever normally used for selecting this totalizer for addition is here used as an automatic control of the bichrome inking ribbon. Inasmuch as similar mechanism is used to select the three totalizers for addition, it is believed that a description of the mechanism used in connection with the #1 totalizer will be sufllcient. 
 The control block 335 (Figs. and 18) has a tappetlug 325 adapted to cooperate with the upturned end 323 of a #1 add hanging bar lever 321, free on a stud 323 in the frame 42. A link 323 (Fig. 13) connect the hanging bar lever 321 to an add-control pawl 333 free on a stud MI in the frame 4|, and the rearward end of said pawl is normally in the path of a shoulder 332 on an add control plate 333, free on a stud 334 in the frame 4 I, and urged counter-clockwise by a spring 335. The plate 333 has a stud 333 embraced by the bifurcated upper end of a link 331, the lowe end of which is pivotally connected to a lever 333 loose on a stud 333 in the frame 4|. The lever 333 has secured to the lower end thereof a shoe 345, the sole of which cooperates with an arcuate surface 343 on a totalizer engagi g plate 341 secured on the main shaft 51. 
 A stud 343 in the plate 341 rotatably supports a totalizer engagirm lever 343, having in the upper end thereof a stud 353, which pivotally supports one end of a link 35I, the other end of which is pivotally connected to an arm 352 secured on a #1 totalizer engaging shaft 353 journaled in the totalizer framework I33 (Fig. 1). Also secured on the engaging shaft 353 are two similar cams 354, only one here shown, having similar camming slots 355, which cooperate with rollers 353 mounted on opposite ends of a rockable frame 351, which supports the #1 totalizer. Pivotally mounted on the stud 353 (Fig. 13) is a totalizer engaging pawl 353 urged counterclockwise by a spring 353 to normally maintain a projection thereof in contact with a stud 333 in the lever 343. 
 An extension 33I of the pawl 353, in cooperation with a square stud 332 in the plate 341, is adapted to rock the #1 totalizer into engagement with the actuators I 33 in adding operations, and a square stud 333, in the plate 341, in cooperation with a prominence on the lever 343, is adapted to disengage the #1 totalizer from the actuators I33 near the end of adding operation. 
 Upon operation of the machine, initial movement clockwise of the main shaft 51 and the totalizer engaging plate 241, as viewed in Fig. 3, moves the arcuate surface 343 out of the path of the shoe 345 to release the lever 333, link 331 and plate 333, to the action of the spring 335. However, when the traveling carriage is so positioned that the tappet 325 (Fig. 10) does not engage the upward extension 323 of the #1 hanging bar lever 321, the pawl 333 remains in the path of the shoulder 332 of the plate 333, as shown in Fig. 13, to obstruct counterclockwise movement of said plate, under influence of the spring 335. when the above condition prevails, initial movement clockwise of the plate 341 7 causes an upward extension 334 of the pawl 353 to engage the stud 333 to rock the extension 33I out of the path of the stud 332, thereby permitting the lever 343 to continue to pivot relatively to the plate 341 and consequently the #1 totalizer engaging mechanism does not function. 
 When the traveling carriage 43 (Figs. 10 and 18) is tabulated to the columnar position corresponding to the control block 335, the stop lug 334 on said block, in cooperation with the tabulating bars 333 and 3 (Figs. 26 and 27), positions the traveling carriage so that the tappet lug 325 engages the upward extension 323 of the lever 321, thus rocking said lever clockwise, as viewed in Fig. 10. Clockwise movement of the lever 321 (Fig. 13) raises the link 323 to rock the pawl 333 counter-clockwise out of the path of the shoulder 332. In this instance, when the arcuate surface 343 moves out of the path of the shoe 345, upon initial movement clockwise of the plate 341, the spring 335 rocks the plate 333, link 331 and lever 333 counter-clockwise to move the stud 333 out of the path of the extension 334. 
 Therefore, after the actuators I33 have been positioned by the depressed amount keys, and near the end of the initial movement clockwise of the plate 341 the extension 3" of the pawl 353 engages the stud 332. This terminates movement of the lever 343 in relation to the plate 341 and causes said lever to move in unison with said plate, which movement, by means of the link 35I, rocks the arm 352, shaft 353 and cams 354 counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise movement of the cams 354 by means of the slots 355 therein, in cooperation with the rollers 353, rocks the totalizer frame 351 clockwise to engage the wheels I33 of the #1 totalizer with the actuators I33. The #1 totalizer remains in engagement with the actuators I33 during their return movement forwardly, to add in said totalizer the amount set up on the keyboard. 
 After the actuators I33 have completed their return movement, and near the end of the return movement counter-clockwise of the plate 341, the stud 333 engages the lever 343, causing said lever to move counter-clockwise in unison with said plate 341, to rock the arm 352, shaft 353 and cams 354 clockwise to normal positions, as here shown, to disengage the wheels I33 of the #1 totalizer from the actuators I33. Return movement counter-clockwise of the plate 341 (Fig. 13) causes the arcuate surface 343, in cooperation with the sole of the shoe 345, to rock the lever 333, link 331, and plate 333 clockwise to normal positions, as here shown, to move the shoulder 332, on said plate, beyond the end of the pawl 333 so that said pawl may again move into the path of said shoulder to obstruct counter-clockwise movement of the plate 333. 
 Further explanation of the totalizer engaging mechanism may be had by referring to the Christion Patent No. 2,038,717. 
Machine locking mechanism Normally, the machine is locked against operation when the traveling carriage is out of columnar position, by mechanism which obstructs releasing movement of the plate 32 (Figs. 3, l0 and 18). When the traveling carriage is in the columnar position corresponding to the control block 335, a tappet lug 335 on said block, in cooperation with the upturned end of a hanging bar lever 333 free on the stud 323, rocks said lever clockwise, in the well known manner, to move the locking mechanism to ineffective position so that the machine may be operated. The above locking mechanism isfully disclosed in the Christian Patent No. 2,038,717, referred to above. Each of the control blocks, of which the block 385 is a representative, located inrelation to the different columnar positions oi! the traveling carriage, has a tappet lug 385 (Fig. 18) which in cooperation with the lever 366 moves the looking means for the plate 62 to ineffective position. 
Automatic repeat mechanism and 18) to the column corresponding to the control block 395 causes a tappet lug 361, on said block, in cooperation with the upturned end 368 ofa hanging bar lever 369, free on the stud 328, to rock said hanging bar lever clockwise, as viewed in Fig. 10. The left end of the lever 369 (Figs. 10 and 13) fits in a slot 394 in a link 318 the lower end of which is pivoted to the key release latch II8. Consequently clockwise movement of said lever 369 lifts the link 318 and rocks the latch II8 clockwise, as viewed in Fig. 13, to move and retain the hook I28 out of the path of the stud I2I during oscillation of the main shaft 51 and the key release disc I22. Obviously the depressed amount keys will not be released, near the end of machine operation, in the manner explained earlier herein, and consequently the amount set up on said keys will be repeat-printed in the succeeding operation of the machine. The slot 394 provides suflicient lost motion, between the lever 369 and the link 318, so that the hook I20 is free to move into the path of the stud I2I, when the tappet 361 does not engage the extension 368 of the lever 369. The lever 369 is also connected by a link 348 (Fig. 10) to an add control pawl 34I for the #4 totalizer, which functions when the tappet lug 361 engages the lever 369, to condition the #4 totalizer for adding operations in exactly the same manner as described for the pawl 330, Fig. 13. 
Control keys The repeat-printing of amounts set up on the keyboard may also be effected by the depression of a repeat key 31I (Fig. 10), depression of which accomplishes the same results as the tappet lug 361, in cooperation with the lever 369. The mechanism connecting the repeat'key 31I to the latch H8 is not here shown, but it is well known in the artand fully explained in the Ellis Patent No. 1,203,863,.referred to hereinbefore. 
 The Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 totalizers are selected and conditioned for sub-total operations by means of their respective sub-total keys 312 to 315, inclusive, and a total operation may be performed in any one of the four totalizers by using a total key 316 in conjunction with the proper one of the sub-total keys 312 to 315 inclusive. This is the reverse of the usual condition in which the keys 312 to 315 are total keys and the key 316 is a sub-total key. It is believed that a description of a sub-total and a total operation, in connection with the #1 totalizer ,sub-total key 312. 
will be sufllcient, as the mechanism and the manner in which it functions are substantially the same for each of the totalizers. 
 The repeat key 31I, the sub-total keys 312 to 315 inclusive, and the total key 316, are mounted on the left side of the accounting machine keyboard in the same row and in substantially the same manner as the releasekey I25, explained earlier herein; that is, the lower ends of said keys extend through corresponding slots in the angle plate-l21, and the'upper ends of said keys extend through corresponding slots in the keyboard plate I26, and each of said keys has a spring similar to the spring I28 for the release key I25, which urges said keys upwardly to normally maintain a shoulder, formed on the upper end thereof, in contact with the lower surface of the plate I26. I 
 Depressing the #1 sub-total key 312 (Fig. 13) move a notch 311 therein opposite a bent-over ear 318 on a key latch lever 319 pivoted on a stud 388 in the frame 4I, whereupon a spring 38I urges said lever clockwise to latch said key 312 depressed. Clockwise movement of the lever '319 causes a stud 382, in the lower end thereof in cooperation with a cammingv surface 383 on a lever 384 free on a stud 385 in the frame H to rock said lever clockwise. Upon clockwise movement of the lever 384, an extension thereof, in cooperation with a stud 386 in a lever 381, also free on the stud 385, rocks said lever 381 clockwise in unison therewith. A spring 388 yieldingly connects the lever 381 to a totalizer engaging pawl 389, also free on the stud 385 and mounted adjacent said lever 381, said spring 388 normally maintaining said pawl in contact with a stud 390 in the lever 381. Also pivotally mounted on the lever 381 is a totalizer disengaging pawl 39I, urged counter-clockwise by a spring 392 into engagement with a stop on said lever 381. Clockwise movement of the lever 381 moves the ends of the pawls 389 and 39I into the path of the lower end ofthe engaging lever 349, said lower end being reinforced by a block 393. 
 Upon operation of the machine, initial movement clockwise of the plate 341 (Fig. 13) causes the end of the lever 349 to engage the pawl 389 to rock the wheels I89 of the #1 totalizer into engagement with the actuators I33 in the manner explained herein'before. Initial movement rearwardly of the actuators I33 reversely rotates the wheels I89 to zero, to position said actuators and the printing sectors to the amount standing on said totalizer wheels. When the plate 341 nears the end of its initial movement, and after printing has been effected, mechanism presently to be described rocks the latch 319 counter-clockwise to disengage the ear 318 thereof, from the notch 311, to release the No. 1 
 This counter-clockwise re storing movement of the latch 319 permits the levers 384 and 381 to be returned, by gravity. counter-clockwise to normal positions to move the pawls 389 and 39I out of the path of the lower end 393 of the lever 349. so that the pawl 39I will not engage the lever 349 and disengage the wheels I89 from the actuators I33. As the wheels I89 remain in engagement with the actuators I33 during their return movement forwardly said wheels are returned to their original positions, to reenterthe amount in the #ltotalizer, after which the stud 363, near the end of return movement of the plate 341, engages the lever III to disengage the wheels I" from the actuators. 
 Depressing the total key I'll in conjunction with the #1 sub-total key I12 selects and conditions the #1 totalizer for a total operation, which is exactly like a sub-total operation, with the exception that the latch III is not rocked counter-clockwise to release the sub-total key I12, near the end of the initial movement of the plate I". Consequently the pawl III remains in the path of the projection III and said projection by-passes said pawls during initial movement clockwise of the plate I". Return movement counter-clockwise of the plate I" causes the end of the lever III to engage the pawl III to rock the totalizer wheel III out of engagement with the actuators III prior to return movement forwardly of said actuators III, thereby leaving the wheels III of the #1 totalizer in a zeroized condition. Near the end of machine operation the latch Ill is rocked counter-clockwise, in a manner presently to be described, to release the #1 sub-total key I12. 
Release of control keys Inasmuch as the time of release of the sub total keys III to I'll, inclusive, determines whether the operation is a sub-total or total operation, it is impossible to use the regular amount key releasing means, explained earlier herein, for releasing these keys, and therefore, a separate releasing mechanism has been provided for this purpose. 
 When the #1 sub-total key I12 (Fig. 13) is depressed, clockwise movement of the latch I'll, under influence of the spring III, causes the ear I", in cooperation with a projection III of a key release bar I", to shift said bar forwardly. The bar I" is shiftably mounted by means of a slot, in the forward end thereof, in cooperation with a stud III in a foot-shaped 1ever III! pivoted on a stud III in the frame II, and by means of a slot III in the rearward end thereof, in cooperation with a stud III in the upper end of a lever I06 fulcrumed on a stud III in the frame II. Mounted adjacent the bar Ill (Figs. 13 and 28) and somewhat similar in outline thereto, is an auxiliary release bar IIII, the forward end of which is slotted to straddle an extension of the stud Illl, and the rearward end of which is pivoted on an extension of the stud Illl. 
 In sub-total operations, the total key I'll is not depressed, which causes the enlarged portion of a wedge III, pivotally mounted on the stem of said key, to be positioned between studs III and Ill carried respectively by the bars Illll and III, to connect said bars so that they will shift forwardly in unison, when the #1 sub-total key I12 is depressed. Forward shifting movement of the bar I08 rocks the lever I06 clockwise to move a footshaped portion III thereof into position to be engaged by an extension III of the stud III in the plate 1. Initial movement clockwise of the plate I" engages the #1 totalizer wheels with the actuators III, as explained above. Near the end of initial movement clockwise of the plate Ill, and after printing has been eflected, the extension III engages the foot III to rock the lever I06 counter-clockwise to shift the bars III and III rearwardly to rock the latch Ill counterclockwise to disengage the ear I'll thereof from the notch I" to permit the key I'll to be spring-returned upwardly to undepressed position. 
Return movement counter-clockwise of the latch I'll (Fig. 13) permits the lever III and the pawls III and III to rock counter-clockwise about their pivot-III to move said pawl III out of the path of the lever III. This permits the wheels I II of the #1 totalizer to remain in engagement with the actuators III during their return movement forwardly, to return said wheels to their original positions, to reenter therein the amount of the sub-total. At the beginning of return movement counter-clockwise of the plate I", the extension III is withdrawn from the foot III and the spring III returns the latch Ill and connected parts clockwise until the ear Ill comes to rest on the edge of the stem of the key III, as shown in Fig. 13. Near the end of return movement counter-clockwise of the plate III the stud III engages the lever III and disengages the #1 totalizer wheels III from the actuators If it is desired to perform a total operation in the #1 totalizer, the total key I'll is depressed in conjunction with the #1 sub-total key Ill. Depressing the total key I'll (Figs. 13 and 28) moves a notch III therein opposite a bent-over ear III of a latch Ill, pivoted on a stud III in the frame II, whereupon a spring III urges said latch III clockwise to engage the ear III with the notch to retain the total key depressed. Depressing the total key I'lI carries the wedge III downwardly in unison therewith to move the enlarged portion thereof from between the studs Ill and II I, to disconnect the bar III from the bar III. An upwardly extending finger of the wedge III, in cooperation with the studs III and III, retains said wedge in proper relationship with said studs. 
 It is, therefore, evident that when the extension III of the stud III (Fig. 13) in cooperation with the lever Ill, shifts the bar I" rearwardly, during initial movement of the plate I", no movement will be imparted to the bar III; consequently the latch Ill will remain in its clockwise position to retain the #1 sub-total key Ill depressed and to retain the pawls III and III in the path of the lever III. 
 Initial movement clockwise of the plate IIl (Fig. 13) causes a stud IIII carried thereby to .by-pass the lower end of a lever III, pivotally mounted on the bar I", said lever being yieldingly retained in a neutral position by a spring III. At the beginning of the return movement counter-clockwise of the plate I", the lower end III of the lever III engages the pawl III to rock the #1 totalizer wheels I 89 out of engagement with the actuators III, before said actuators start their return movement forwardly, thereby leaving said wheels in a zeroized condition. Continued counter-clockwise movement of the plate I" causes the stud III to engage the lower end of the lever III to rock said lever clockwise until a surface I! I, on the upper end thereof, contacts a stud I22 in the frame I I, whereupon continued clockwise movement of said lever shifts the bar I" rearwardly. Rearward movement of the bar Ill causes the projection III thereon to rock the latch Ils counter-clockwise to disengage the ear I'll from the notch I'll in the key I12 to permit said key to be spring-returned upwardly to undepressed position and to permit the pawls III and III to be returned counter-clockwise out of the path'of the lever III to normal position, as shown in Fig. 13. When the stud Ill moves beyond the lower end of the lever III the spring III returns the latch I'll clockwise until the ear I" comes to rest on the edge of the key I12.
