Glasliutte, Germany; vested in the Alien Property Custodian Application November 2, 1937, In Germany August Serial No. 172,446 1'1, 1936 3 Claims- (CL 235-62) This invention relates to a calculating machine having a ing or recording device. 
Calculating machines, especially adding machines, with a device for recording or printing new and improved built-in registerthe calculated amounts are known. In machines of this kind, theitem set up on the keyboard is not only entered in the calculating mechanism, but is also printed or, otherwise recorded. 
 Calculating machines capable of carrying out addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are known which are provided with a recording apparatus. a 
 The present invention starts from this form of construction. to the devices of this kind in which not only the individual items set by the keys but also the results of the calculations are recorded, consequently requiring a total taking mechanism of very complicated constructional design, the invention is concerned with the task of recording the individual addition orsubtraction items-only by'means of the recordin device and then recording end of the calculation by transferring the total result to the key board and again introducing it into the calculating mechanism subtractively. This results in clearing the totalizer with simultaneous recording of the total result. 
The entire construction is simplified as a mat- According to the invention, a further simplification is attained by making use of one and the same motor drive or hand drive for the calculating mechanism and the recording mechanism. The recording mechanism is coupled to or disengaged from the drive of the calculating mechanism by means of a shift lever. A gearing may also be interposed when recording in orderto reduce the present customary high speed of the drive shaft when calculating only. 
It is advisable to provide a hand lever by means of which the shaft activating the recording device may be coupled to or disengaged from the main calculating shaft. In this way it is possible to combine the recording device with the'setting so that, during amount to the totalizer, the'amount is simultaneously printed or recorded on the paper tape. 
 When there is present a reducing earing that reduces the operating speed of the machine during recording, it is likewise operate by the said hand lever the couplingsior the connection and disconnection of this reduction gearing. 
the 
.the total result at the control ofa single handle transfer of the keyed or'set an objector the invention to When the type rollers are-set by slidable members that cooperate with stepped setting members which are in connection with the keys of the board, it is an object of the invention to give the stepped setting members the form of rocking levers. This presents the advantage of sure guidance with the simplest constructional means. 
Furthermore it is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement whereby the type is securely attached to type rollers or the like and to provide such type rollers with one or more blank type spaces in addition to the ten type from "0 It is a further object to provide means to maintain the type wheels corresponding with those denominations higher than significant value-or the actual amount, in such a position that they present their blank types opposite the recording or platen present their 0" types to the platen in those denominations of the amount wherein no keys have been depressed.

 ,First of all the parts of the calculating machine shown in Fig. 1 will be described. 
The calculating mechanism nine key stems II that are vertically displaceable. These key stems II are provided with key buttons l2 that carry the figures 1 to 9. The bottom ends of the key stems II are guided in a plate l3 which is connected with the plate In. 
 On each of the key stems ll there is located a roller l4 which cooperates with a bar I5. The bar I5 is connected with the link It and the lever arm I! in articulated parallelogram fashion. While the link IB is pivoted to the plate l3 by means of the pin 18, the lever I1 is oscillatably mounted on the plate I3 by means of the pin l9. To the lever arm I! there is integrally secured a lever arm I? with the top end ofv which a roller cooperates. The roller means of the pin 2| on an extension 22' of a slide 22. Each plate I0 is provided with a slide 22, and these slides 22 have fork-like claws 23 which set the gears 24. 
 The gears 24 are axially displaceable but nonrotatably mounted on the rectangular shafts 25 which carry the bevel gear mountings 25 (see Fig. 9). These bevel gear mountings 25 are longitudinally slidable'but non-rotatably mounted on the shafts 25. All the mountings 25 are Jointly controlled by a bar 28, and all the bevel gear mountings 27 that are similarly mounted on the shafts 21' are controlled by a. bar 25. According to whether the bars 28 and 29, as shown in Fig. 9, are displaced to the right or to the left, the bevel gears 25', 21 or 25", 21" engage the bevel gears and 3| respectively of the totalizing mechanism and the revolutions counter mechanism. The bevel gears 30 and 3| are mounted for rotation on shafts secured on the carriage 2 and are connected with the number wheels 30' and II respectively. 
 When the bars 28 and 29 are moved to the right from the position shown in Fig. 9 so that the bevel gears 25' and 27' come into engagement with the gears 30 and 3| respectively, then the number wheels 30' and ii are turned in a clockwise or positive direction while on movement of the bars 28 and 29 to the left from the position shown in Fig. 9, the bevel gears 26" and 21'? are engaged with the respective gears 30 and 3|, to turn the number wheels counterclockwise or in a negative direction. The number wheels 30' and 3| show through the windows 4' and 3' of the totalizing and revolutions counters. An actuator cylinder 32, as is customary in Thomas type calculatin'g machines, is secured on a shaft 53 positioned parallel to each shaft 25 (Fig. 2). On each shaft 33 there is secured a bevel gear 34 that is in engagement with a bevel gear 35. All the bevel gears 35 of the calculating mechanism 20 is mounted bythe rollers carried are secured on the main calculating shaft 36. 7| 
 33, as is customary in the Thomas type of machines, impart step by step motion to 21" of the revolutions counter, by means (not shown). 
Operation of calculating mechanism The arrangement and mode of operation of the device Just described is such that when, for example, the 5 key (Fig. 1) is depressed, the roller M (Fig. 2) of the respective key stem H will strike against the bar I5 and tilt the lever system l5, l7 and H in such a way that the bar 22 is operated to set the respective gear 24 opposite that portion of the actuator cylinder 32 that has five teeth. 
 The key stems H are under the influence of tension springs (not shown) which tend to restore the depressed keys to their normal positions, as shown in Fig. 2. In the depressed position, the key stem is held by the locking or check bar 31, which is pulled to the right by means of a spring (not shown). As the key stem H is depressed the check'bar 31 is urged to the left and when by the key stems H clear the slots in the check bar 3? check bar will be urged to the right by the spring not shown and thereby lock the stern ii in depressed position. Each bar has a hoolnehaped plate 38 which is engaged by a tension spring 39 which is secured at the other end to a hook 40 on the plate l0. By means of this tension spring 39, the roller 26 is always held against the lever ii. 
The recorder setting mechanism According to the invention each of the twoarmed levers I1, I? is provided with a third arm l1" to the bottom end of which one end of a bar 42 is pivoted at M. The other end of the bar 42 is pivoted to a stepped scroll plate 40 by means of the pin (it. its many plates 40 are provided as there are levers 11''. All the plates 40 are suspended in pendulum fashion by means of pivot pins 44 on the machine frame. 
 Each stepped scroll plate 40 cooperates with a lever 45, the top end 45' of which bears against a laterally projecting pin 45 provided on the plate 40. Tension springs 41 which are secured at one end by means of the pins 48 to an obtuseangled comb plate 49 hold the levers 45 in contact with pins 45. 
 The comb plate 49, which is secured to the machine frame by means of screws 50 (Fig. 4), is provided with parallel guide slots for the stepped scroll plates 40. The levers 45 are pivotally mounted on the common shaft 5| which. is secured to the machine frame. At their lower trude through frame wall 53. Furthermore each stepped scroll plate to cooperates with a rack bar 54 which is held vertically displaceable between three comb-like guides 55" secured by means of the rectangularly bent flaps 55' between two frame plates 56 which are attached to the machine frame by means of angle Each rack bar has an extension 58, with the pin-like end 58' to which one end of 55' on the two frame plates 56. 
 The cross bar SI of a restraining and restoring bail overlies all the extensions 58 of the springpressed rack bars 54, the arms 62 of the bail extending forwardly and being fastened at their ends to a rocking shaft 58 which is mounted in the machine frame. Each of the bail arms 52 is engaged by a strong tension spring 64 (Fig. '7) which acts in opposition to the springs 59 and tends to apply the bail arms 52, against the top v edge of the frame plate 58. 
 The bail arms 52 contact at their under edges the rollers 85 which are provided with a groove therefor and these rollers are pivoted at one of the ends of the two cranks 55. The cranks 85 are fixed on a rocking shaft 65 positioned in the machine frame. On the rocking shaft 86 there is also fixed a lever arm 51 which is pivotally connected at 61' to the rod 58 whose other end is pivoted to the crank pin 59. The crank pin 59 is secured to the crank 10, the boss ID of which is positioned rotatably and displaceably on the shaft I I. The boss IIV'of the crank is provided with an annular groove 12 (see also Fig. 1) in which the shift claw I3 engages. This shift claw pling member is displaced to the left in Fig. i so that the coupling claws 8| and 88' are in engagement with each other, then the coupling gearing 81-48 there is a gear reduction of about is secured to a lever I4 the top end of which projects upwardly above the key board plate It and is formed into a handle I5, the lever 14 being pivoted at I5 near the base of the machine, for rocking movement transversely of the keyboard. The bottom free end 14' of the lever I4 engages in a hole 'I'l' of the coupling bar 11. The bar 11 is pivoted on the machine frame by means of the pin I8. The free end 11 of the coupling bar 'II engages in the annular groove IQ of a coupling member 80 slidably keyed on the shaft 85. The 
extent of rocking motion of the manually operable lever I4 is restricted by the length ofthe' transverse slot formed in the keyboard plate I0, Fig. 1, through which the upper end of the lever I4 rojects. 
Coupling of recording mechanism with calculating mechanism The drive of the machine is effected by the electric motor 8|, the connection and disconnection of which with the drive mechanism of the machine is effected by a contact arrangement that is activated on depressing one of the keys 5 or 8 or 8. Such an arrangement is shown in German Patent No. 457,825. on the shaft 82 of the electric motor there is fixed a spur ear 85 which meshes with a spur gear 84- freely rotatable on the shaft 85 secured in the machine frame. Connected with the spur gear 84 is a boss 85 provided with coupling claws 86' opposed to a complementary coupling 80' on the coupling rnemloer 80. In engagement with the spur gear 84 there is also a spur gear 81 which rotates a further spur'gear 88 on the common drive shaft 8! rotatably'mounted in the machine frame. In 
' engagement with the spur gear 88 there is a spur gear 90 which is likewise freely rotatable on the shaft 85. Connected with this spur gear 80 there is a boss 9| provided with coupling claws 8|. 7 
' Connected with the coupling member 80, there is also a sprocket wheel 82 having a boss 88 which is'provided with coupling claws 88 opposed to the coupling 8| on the face of spur wheel 80. The coupling claws 88" are in engagement with the coupling claws 88', or the coupling claws 8| with the coupling claws 88', according to whether the coupling member 88 actuated by the lever I1 is in the right hand position due to a movement of thehand lever 14 as seen in Fig. 1, or is in the left hand position. when the coupling claws and 88' are in engagement, the motor shaft 82 is directly connected with the coupling member 88 via the spur gears 88 and 84. But if the. cou- I engagement 3 to 1 over a direct connection of the coupling -the sprocket wheel 95 there is a spur gear 88 which is in engagement with the spur gear 88.- 
The spur gear 99 is freely rotatable on the stud IIIII which is likewise secured to the frame plate 88. The spur gear ill that is located on the main calculating shaft 88 is in engagement with spur gear 98, and there is another spur gear I52 in with spur gear IOI. Spur gear I52 is freelyrotatable on the shaft II and is provided with coupling claws I02. 
 If, by means of the lever 14 and the shift claw 13, the boss of the crank 10 is displaced to the right in Fig. 1, then the coupling claws I52 engage in corresponding recesses I2 of the boss III of the crank I0, thus resulting in coupling the crank III with the spur wheel I82. During the necessary rocking of th lever 14 for this purpose, the lever 11 is rocke to the left, Fig. 1, by means of the pin I4. This however brings the coupling claws 80, and the coupling claws SI, 88' will engage each other, so that the drive coupling member 88 is switched to slower speed. 
Release of recording is set in operation, the crank II! is also set in rotation simultaneously with the main calculating shaft 86. This rocks the shaft 55 counterclockwise through connecting rod 58 and lover arm 61, and the shaft 58 rocks its cranks 85 counter-clockwise. The grooved rolls 85' on the cranks raise the restraining and restoring bail arms 52 into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 2. This results in the cross rod 8I releasing the extensions 58, so that the rack bars 54 are freed to the action of the springs 58, ex- 
cept for their individual latch mechanisms next explained. 
 Setting of type rollers On each of the rack bars 54 there is furthermore secured a plate I03 which has a nose I88 provided at its edge. 
the plane of that stepped scroll plate 48 that pertains to the respective rack bar 84. Under each stepped scroll plate 48 there is furthermore installed a rocking latch I84 which has the form shown in Figs. 2; 4 and 6. The latches I84 are rockably positionedon the common shaft I84 which is secured tothe machine frame. Each 85' out of engagement This nose extends into. 
latch I04 is engaged by a tension spring I04 which tends to rock the latches I04 of Figs. 2, 4 and 6 to the left. 
 Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 3 and 5, each latch I04 is provided with a lateral tongue I04 bent rectangularly from the plane of the latch, which tongue extends into the range of movement of that rearward extension 58 of the corresponding rack bar 54. Thus, when the double lever 62 is in the bottom position (see Fig. 2), all the latches I04 are drawn back somewhat to the right by the extensions 58 against the pull of the springs I04 In this position of the latches I04, the fingers 52 of the levers 45 swing upwards in the manner indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 2, provided of course'that the levers 45 have been freed to the action of their springs 41 by the withdrawal of the stepped scroll plates 40 and their pins 48 through the depression of keys I2 in the corresponding denominations. In such case, the corresponding levers 45 are rocked counter-clockwise to locate their rearwardly projecting fingers 52 in the paths of laterally turned ears I04 formed on the latches I04, to hold the latches in their normal positions. 
 Furthermore, each of the latches I 04 is provided with a. tail I04 which is bent off obliquely from the plane of'the latch I04 in the manner shown in Figs. 3 and 5. The tails IIJ4 are given such a shape that their ends engage back of the adjoining latches I04 of the next higher decimal places. In this way it is contrived that when, for example as shown in Fig. 5, the fourth latch I04 from the left-is prevented from swinging in by the finger 52, it also holds back the other latches located to the left of it. Say the said decimal place indicates the thousands, then the latches corresponding to the hundreds, tens and units will also be held back simultaneously. 
 At the top edge of each of the latches I04 there is furthermore provided a nose-like projection I04 which, when the latch I04 is in its extreme left position (see Fig. 4), extends into the range of movement of the nose I of the corresponding rack bar 54 and prevents its upward movement. 
 The bars 54 are each provided with a toothed rack 54'. In engagement with each of these racks is a toothed gear I secured to the flank of a type roller I08. All the type wheels I08 are positioned on the common shaft I01 which has both ends secured in the frame plates 58. Here, as can be seen from Figs. 3 and 5, there are arranged alongside each other nine type wheels corresponding to the number of banks of keys. Each of the type wheels is provided with two blank spaces I08 and with ten digit types 0"- 9. These types are applied to the circumfer ence of each type wheel in such a way that the digits, beginning with 0, are arranged counterclockwise. 
The siim recording mechanism Referring to Figs. 3 and 5, there is installed on the left side along with the type wheels I88 still another type wheel I08 which carries the sign and the sign at the points indicated in Fig. 8. The type wheel I08 is connected with a toothed gear IIO which corresponds to the other against a ring I seat m' in the extension 58 to which a spring 53 is connected. The nose II2 extends into the plane of a sign type selecting lever H3 which is mounted on the pivot 44. The bottom end of the lever H3 is equipped with three stepped portions H3, III" and H8 and with an arresting stop H3. In the position of rest of the lever II3, this arresting stop is yieldingly held by means of a tension spring II5 against the comb plate 49 which carries a guide slot for the lever III. 
Coupling of sign recording mechanism with calculating mechanism Into the range of movement of the sign type selecting lever III there extends the rear end of a rod II5 (see Fig. 9) extending forwardly through a guide sleeve I I1 secured to the machine frame. The forward end of the rod abuts a depending arm I2I fast on rocking shaft I22. Encirciing the rod is a pressure spring II8 which bears at one end against the sleeve I I1 and. at the I 8 secured on the rod II8 to normally hold the rear end of the rod withdrawn from engagement with the sign type selecting lever H8, and maintain the forward end of rod in abutting relation with the depending arm I2I. A collar I20 on the rear end of the rod H8 contacts the rear end of the guide sleeve I20 to limit the forward thrust of the rod Ill. The rocking shaft I22 is connected by means of pins I22 with the shift bar 28 controlling the engagement of the bevel gears 26', 28" with the totalizing wheel bevel gear 30, for addition or subtraction. 
 0n the rocking shaft I22 there is furthermore secured a crosspiece I24 which carries the two studs I24 and I24". With these two studs there cooperates alternately the shoulder I25 or I25" respectively of a T-shaped pitman I25, the tail of which is pivoted at I28 to the rocker I21. 0n the plate I21 there is located a roller I28 which cooperates with a cam disc I29 that is positioned on the shaft 88. On one rotation of the shaft 88, the roller I28 is forced out of the recess or circumference of the cam disk I28 and at the completion of such rotation, the roller I28 again seats itself in the recess I20. The rocker I21 carrying the roller I28, therefore, is rocked counter-clockwise (Fig. 9) where it is held during the rotation of the cam disk I28 until the recess I29 of the cam disk again registers with the roller I28, whereupon the spring I20 restores the rocker to its normal posicoincidentally the pitman I25 is forced to the right, and as the rocker I21 restores, it withdraws the head of the pitman from the cross As can be seen from Fig. 9, the cross piece I24 is moved clockwise or counter-clockwise according to whether the pitman I25 cooperates with the stud I24 or with the stud I24". By means of the pins I23, the shifter bar 28 is thereby pushed either to the right or to the left. 
 If the shifter bar 28 is pushed to the right so that the bevel gears 26 'enter into engagement with the bevel gears of the totalizer mechanism, then the coupling is set for addition, whereas, on shifting the bar to the left, the bevel gears 28" enter into engagement with the bevel gears 80, resulting in a negative or subtractive setting of the totalizing mechanism. 
 The setting of the pitman I25 the double armed lever I3I on the rocking pivot I22. the double armed lever' is effected by which is positioned The free forked end of I2I engages over a pin type wheel. 
I33 on the link I34. One end of the link I34 with its slotted hole I34 engages around a guide pin I33 provided on the machine frame, while the other end is connected with a lever'l31 by means of the pivot I33. The lever I31 is connected with a complementary lever I33, both levers being rockably positioned on the pivot i33 provided on the machine frame. Camsurfaces E31 and I38 are provided at the ends of the complementary levers I31 and I38. 
 Above the levers I31 and I38, the add and subtract key levers M and I which carry the keys 8 and 3 are pivotally mounted at I42. On the key lever 640 which carries the key 3 there is provided a stud I40 which extends into the plane of the cam surface I31. On the lever I4! which carries the key there is installed the stud P which extends into the plane of the cam surface I38. The construction and operative functions of the state control-levers I31 and I38 are disclosed in my co-pending application, Serial No. 117,952, filed December 28, 1936, patented September 17, 1940, No, 2,215,263. 
Operation of sign recording mechanism When the key 3 is depressed, the stud I4I' wipes along the inclined surface I38 as the subtraction key lever I4I rocks downwardly. Thereupon the complementary levers I38 and I31, as shown in Fig. 9, are rocked to theright against the pull of the spring I43. By this rocking of the lever, the link I34 is pushed to the right and the double arm lever I3I is tilted in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 9. The pitman I23 is thereby moved downwardly to such an extent that its shoulder I23" lies in front of the stud I P Owing to the rearward pushing movement of the pitman I23 produced on rotation of the main shaft 36, the cross piece I24 is turned countar-clockwise in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 9, so that the shifter bar 28 moves the corresponding gear mountings 23, as shown in Fig. 9, to the left and the bevel gears 23" come into engagement with the totalizer mechanism bevel gears 30. During this movement of the cross piece I24, the rod H3 is, by means of the depending arm I2I, displaced to such an extent to the right against the pressure of the spring II8, as shown in Fig. 9, that the sign type selecting lever H3 is moved into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 9 in which the stepped portion I I3" is positioned within the range of move ment oi. the nose 2' of the rack bar II I of the sign printing type wheel. 
 Furthermore there is secured to the sign selecting lever I I3a pin I44 which lies in the path of movement of a beak I43, on a lever I43 that is pivoted on the machine frame at I43 and is provided with a handle I41. The lever I43 is equipped with two indentations I48 andl43 with which a spur I30 cooperates. This spur I30 is mounted-on a spring I3I that is secured to one of the frame plates 36 by means of the screws I32. 
- If the lever I43 is moved by meansof the handle I41 into the dotted line position shown. in Fig. 8 so that the nose or spur I30 oi the spring enters the groove I48, then the sign selecting lever H3 is simultaneously brought, against the pull of the spring II3, into the dotted line position shown in Fig. 8. The step H3 is thereby brought within the range of movement of the nose II! of the rack bar III for the sign printing The printing apparatus The printing apparatus cooperating with the 4 type wheels I03 and I03 consists of two parallel plates I33 which are positioned by means of the trunnion I34 on the two projections 33' of the frame plates 36. The platen cylinder I33 is positioned on the interconnected plates I33 by means of the .shaft I33. The paper tape I33 coming from the reel I31 is led over this printing cylinder, a guide roll I33 being inserted between the reel W1 and the cylinder I53. The axle I of the reel I31 is located in easily exchangeable position in corresponding slots I in the plates I33. 
 The tape coming from the platen cylinder I33 is wound on the winding reel I32, the axle I33 01! which is likewise located in easily exchangeable pending guide bar of the lever I14 at position in two slots I34 in the plates I33. In front of the platen cylinder I33 there is installed the inking roller I33, the shaft I33 of which is carried at the ends of two spaced levers I31. The other ends of the levers I61 are secured on a shaft I38 which is positioned in the plates I33. One of the plates I33 is engaged by one end of a tension spring I33 and the other end of the spring is secured to the end of a lever I1I (Fig. '1) by means of the bolt I13. 
 Normally, the plates I33 rest against pins I12 which are installed on the projections or extensions 33. On one of the plates I33 there is secured a hooked projection I13 which cooperates with the nose I14 provided on a locking lever I14 which is mounted on the frame projection 33' by means of the pivot I13. A vertically de- I11 is pivoted at the free end I13 and this bar is held in guide slot .I18 formed in the horizontal flange of a bracket H13 attached to the inner face of the left hand frame plate 33. The depending guide bar I11 is provided with a stop I19. A tension spring I engaging with the lever I14 tends to holdthe lever I14 in the position shown in Fig. 'I with the stop nose I19 in contact with the horizontal flange. 
 A printer-actuating lever IN is mounted on one of the frame plates 33 by means of the pivot I3I By means of the pivot I82 there is secured to the lever I1I an adjustable plate I83 which is flanged along one longitudinal edge, as at I84, to provide a cam path. The plate I83 is provided with a slot I83 through which there engages a bolt I83 that is secured to the lever "I. With the 'bottom end of the plate I33 there engages a tension spring I83, the other end of which is secured at I31 to the lever I1 I. This spring I83 tends to hold the plate I33 in the po ition shown in Fla. '1 and the slot I83 permits the plate I83 to swing rearwardly against the pull of the spring I83 in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 7. A roller I88 positioned on the bail 3I traverses the cam path printer lever I1I. General operation The mode of operation can be explained by I34 to rock the -means of an example in calculation. It is assumed that the following numbers are to be added 7,200 3,17 5 
 As the numbers to be added are to be recorded also, the handle 13 (Figs. 1 and 2) must first be set to the position indicatedby S in Fig. 1. By 
this setting of the hand lever, the boss 12 -of the crank 10 is slid to th right (Fig. 1) on the shaft H to fit the recesses 12"01 the bars 12 III fast of the crank ll over the coupling claws III of the spur wheel I02, and the crank is consequently coupled with the spur wheel I 02. The 
'lever I1 is simultaneously shifted in the previously described manner to connect the intermediate gearing 8'I-9Il with the drive so that the main calculating drive shaft 38, when the electric motor is operated, only makes about one third the speed'oi' rotation made when the drive is direct. 
 To clarify the decription of the' operation up to this point, it willbe understood from the foregoing that the motor OI (Fig. 2) is of the intermittent type. the flow of current from any suitable source being controlled by either the "add" or subtract keys I or 9 (Fig. 1) respectively. 
 Also that the control lever 15, I4 (Fi 2) for determining whether the machine shall calculate only, or shall calculate and print, is normally in its intermediate position in the slot in the key board. 
 The motor ll drives its motor shaft 82 which carries the drive pinion I! in constant mesh with a larger gear M journaled on the drive shaft 85. The drive member ll of a clutch is mounted on one face of the gear 84. 
 A co-acting coupling member 80 (Fig. 1) is splined on the drive shaft II; that end of the coupling member adjacent and opposed to the clutch member 86 having a drive clutch face 80 formed thereon to engage with the driving clutch face 88'. engagement and disengagement of the clutch face I. relatively to the driving clutch face I8. 
 Obviously, when the clutch faces are engaged, the power from the motor is transmitted directly to the drive shaft BI, through pinion Bl, gear 84, and clutch faces 88', II. 
 The sprocket wheel 82 fast on the extended hub of the coupling member 8|, through its sprocket chain 84, drives a sprocket I! Journaled on a stub shaft I1 and having a pinion ll fast thereon in constant mesh with a gear 99 journaled on a stub shaft Ill. 
 Gear ll meshes with a totalizer driving gear on the main calculator drive shaft 30, and the driving gear IlI in turn meshes with a Bear II iournaled on the stub shaft II and having a clutch face in. 
 The sprocket I! of the coupling member ll. therefore, is in driving connection with the calculating drive shaft 38 at all times, and actuates the calculating drive shaft at high speed when the control lever II, It is rocked to the left from it normal intermediate position, to that end of its slot marked RI 4 Obviously, when the control lever ll, H is in its intermediate position, the coupling member ll is disengaged from its high speed coacting clutch member 88' and no motion is imparted to the calculating mechanism drive shaft a. 
 The manually operable control lever II, 14 connects directly (Fig. 2) with the shift lever 17 at the base of the machine. the rear end of which shift lever-engages the axially shiftable coupling member 80, whereby to enable the control lever to shift the coupling member. 
 This manually operable control lever I5, I4 also determines the operation of the prin to which end, it is directly connected by a forked arm It with the hub of a crank 10, the hub being axially slidable along the stub shaft II and having a clutch face III engageable with and disengageable from a complementary clutch face Iii of the gear I02 driven from the sprocket 82 of the cou-, 
 drawn the 20 on the key board 2a) on which the pling member 80, from which the power is derived. 
 A link 68 connects the crank arm "III with an arm 61 fast on the shaft 86 to which shaft is also fast the parallel arms 85 provided with the rollers I? for operating the printer restraining bail 82, l 
 So long as the restraining and restoring bail 82, SI remains in its lowered position, shown in full lines in Figs. 2 and 20, under the influence of its strong springs 84, no printing can occur, notwithstanding the retention of individual rack bar latches I04 in idle position by the check levers when depression of numeral keys I2 has withstepped scroll plates 40 clockwise to their corresponding differential positions. 
 Because the printing operation requires more time to complete than does a calculating opera tion, it is necessary, when listing the items set up as well as adding them, to abandon the use of the high speed direct connection between the motor and the coupling member 80, substituting therefor a reduced speed (giv for the calculating mechanism drive shaft To this end, the countershai't 89 (Figs. 1, 2 and gear 8'! is fast, also carries a pinion 88 spaced apart from the gear 81 and fast on the shaft. 
30 This pinion is in mesh with 'a large reduction The hand lever 15, H controls the gear 90 journaled on the shaft 85 with a clutch face 9I,- SI opposed to a co-acting clutch face 83, 93' formed on the outer flank of the sprocket wheel 92, which it will be remembered and provided 95 is connected with and forms part of the coupling member axially slidable along, and splined to the shaft 85. 
 By shifting the control lever I5, 74 clockwise (to the right. Fig. 1) the coupling member 88 shifts to the left to engage the clutch face 93, 93 with the clutch face 9!, 9| on the reduction gear III, so that the power is now led from the motor shaft 82, and through drive pinion 83, loose gear I4, counter gear 81, counter shaft 88, counterpinion 88, reduction gear 80 and clutch faces I, 83 to the sprocket wheel 92, and thence, via sprocket chain 84, sprocket wheel 95, and gears ll and I III to the main calculating mechanism drive shaft 36, through the operation of which the amount indexed on the key board is entered in the calculating wheels I I. 
 This shifting of the control lever 15, H to the 8" position at the right of the slot in the key board also results in drawing its forked arm 13 along, and with it the crank arm." slidably along stub shaft 1|, to engage the clutch face 12' on the hub of the crank arm with the clutch face I82 on the gear I02 of shaft 13. The crank pin 89 connecting the crank 10 and link 88 is of sufficient length (Fig. 1) to permit axial movement of the crank relatively to the link. 
 It will be understood that with the controllever II, N in both its intermediate and in its left hand Positions, the clutch faces I2 and IE2 are disengaged. 
 Engagement of the clutch faces 12 and I02 enables the transmission of motor power from the gear III to the crank arm III, which operates through the link 88, and arm 81 to rock the shaft ll with its arms II, which latter thereupon rock the restraining and restoring ball 82, BI upwardly to release such of the printer rack bars 54 as are free to move, to the actions of their individual springs 58. i 
The printer rack bars differentially turn the Now 7,200 is indexed on the keyboard, and 
this is done by depressing the 7 in the fourth bank of keys from the right and the 2 in the third bank of keys from the right. By depressing the 7 in the fourth bank of keys from the right, 
the respective levers I5, IE, IT, II'are brought into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 2. 
At the same time, by means of the extension II" and the bar 42, the corresponding stepped scroll plate 40 is rocked into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 2A. Also the associated gearadjusting slide 22 is displaced by means of the lever arm H in such a way that the corresponding actuator cylinder gear 24 is set opposite that point of the actuator cylinder 32- that has seven teeth. 
 In this position of the plate 40 (see position in Fig. 4) the tooth 40" will cooperate with the nose I03. 0n the movement of the stepped scroll plate 40 into the position as shown in Fig. 4, the pin 46 releases the corresponding blocking 45 so that it can take up the position shown in dotted movement due to the movement of the linkage '08, G1, 55, and '05, and to the return springs 54. 
 On the upward movement of the arms of the restraining and restoring bail 6 I, lever 62, the bail cross rod GI releases all the projections 58 of the printer rack bars 54 so that the printer rack bars are subjected to the action of the springs 50 which tend to move the rack bars 54 upwardly as far as'possible. On the upward movement of the rack bars, the projections 58 release the laterally off set lugs I04 that are provided on the latches I04, so that the latches I04 are freed to the action of the springs I04 The latches I04 belonging to the five extreme left banks of keys thereby move into the extreme left positions shown in Fig. 4, so that the noses I04 enter the paths of movement of the stops or noses I03 lines in Fig. 2A or the position shown in Fig. 4, 
The finger-like extension 52 belonging thereto is thereby moved into the path of the angular offset I04" 0f the latch I04. 
The stepped scroll plate belonging to the third bank of keys from the right is moved into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 6, so 
that the step indicated by 40 enters into the path of the nose I03 of the associated rack bar 54. In this case also the respective blocking lever is released by the pin 46 so that the corresponding finger 52 moves in front of the rectangular stop I04" of the cooperating latch I04. 
 -All the other blocking levers 45 remain in their effective initial positions because only the two keys mentioned have been depressed. 
 If now the key 8 is depressed, then the corresponding lever I40 is moved downwardly with the respective pin I40 impinging against the cam surface I31 and the levers I31 and I33 are moved into the positions shown in Fig. 9, provided they have not already occupied such positions. Furthermore, by means of the rod I34, the pitm'an I25 is also set in the position shown in Fig. 9 provided it has notalready occupied this position, so that the shoulder I25 is located 'in front of the stud I24. 
 Through the downward movement of the key lever I40, the electric motor is started by means of a rod connection (notshown in the drawings)- case the amount 7,200 appears therein on termination of the rotation of the calculating drive shaft 30. 
Simultaneously with the calculating drive shaft 36, the crankl0 also makes a rotation being driven by the spur gears IN and I02. This permits the arms of the restraining and restoring bail 5|, lever 62, to execute an upward and downward that are mounted on the rack bars 54. 
 The rack bars 54 belonging to the five extreme left banks of keys can only move upwardly one step until the noses I03 on the rack bars 54 contact the hook-like portions latches I 04 It must here be pointed out that in Figs. 3 and 5 these five bars are located on the right side because these figures are rear views. The said five rack bars move one step upwardly to locate the blank space I08 that is positioned next to the "0 type opposite the printing line of the platen cylinder I55. 
 On the other hand, the rack bar 54 that belongs to the fourth bank of keys moves upwardly into the position shown in Fig. 4, because the latch I04 belonging to this rack bar is held by the finger 52 in the rearward position shown in'Fig. 4. The respective type wheel is therefore turned to position the type '7 to be printed when the platen cylinder assumes the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4 at the time of printing. 
The rack bar 54 pertaining to the third bank of keys moves upwardly until the nose I03 impinges against the step 40 of the corresponding plate 40, shown in Fig. 6, to rotate the corresponding type wheel to position the type 2 cpposite the platen cylinder I55. The latch I04 pertaining to this rack bar 54 is also prevented from swinging in by the finger 52, so that the nose I03 of the rack bar 54 can pass by the hooked projection I04 of the latch. 
 As regards the latches located to the left of the last named latchI04, as seen in Fig. 5, and which belong to the toothed racks or bars 54 of the second and first banks of keys, these have their oblique cross-over tails I04 engaging in back of each other and of the latch of. the third bank of keys. These two latches are held back in the position shown in Fig. 6 50 that their noses I04 lie outside the paths of movement of the noses I03 of the corresponding rack bars 54. This means however that the rack bar 54 pertaining to the two extreme right hand banks of keys can move upwardly into the positions shown in Fig. 6 in which the noses I03 contact against the bottom steps 40, of their respective stepped scroll plates 40 to turn the two corresponding type I04 on the cated at the printing point, the fourth and third type wheels from the right, present a. "7 and a "2, respectively, to the platen, and the second and first type wheels each present a to the platen. 
As regards the sign type rack bar III it is Printing operation for first item On the upward movement of the restraining and restoring bail SI, 62, the roller I88 on the cross bar 8| (Figs 3 and 7), wipes along the cam path I84 to rock the lever III counter-clockwise in the direction of the lowermost arrow in Fig. 7, which tensions the printer spring I59. The plat.- en I55 and associated mechanism is, however, 
.prevented by the hooked nose II4' from joining in the counter-clockwise movement. It is only shortly before the restraining and restoring bail GI, 82 reaches its topmost position that one of the arms 82 engages with the sliding bar I11 and the lever I14 is thereby rocked against the pull of the spring I80 to cause its hooked nose IN to release the projection I13 whereupon the platen I55 and associated mechanism is moved in the direction of the uppermost arrow shown in Fig. 7 toward the type on the type wheels. Thereupon the ink supply roller I65 first rolls over and inks the typein the printing position, and the platen cylinder I55 then presses the paper tape I58 against the type. 
 In the topmost position of the bail GI, 62, the roller I88 passes beyond the range of the cam surface I84, so that the printer lever III is released. The platen and associated mechanism can now drop back under its own weight into the initial position shown in Fig. 7, thereby bringing back the printer lever I'II into the initial position shown in Fig. 7. On downward movement of the bail GI, 62, the roller I88 rolls upon the inner edge I84 of the cam surface I84, thereby occasioning a rocking of the cam plate I83 against the pull of the spring I88. Finally, the roller I88 again releases the cam plate I83 when the bail I, 82 has almost reached its lowermost position. 
Operation for addition of second item After the amount 7,200 has been entered on the totalizing mechanism and also printed on the paper tape I58, the next number to be added 3,175 is introduced into the keyboard. By depressing the corresponding keys, the respective ste ped scroll plates 40 are given the corresponding settings b the links 42, so that on depressing the addition key 8, the amount is printed on the paper tape at the same time that it is registered in the totalizing mechanism. 
 The result 10,375 that now appears in the totalizing mechanism is now transferred into the keyboard and this can be done by hand, if necessary, by any of the known back transfer devices. 
Transfer of result Hereupon the hand lever I4'I is-brought into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 8 so that the sign type selecting lever II: coupled thereto takes up the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 8. Now the subtraction key 8, Figs. 1 and 9, is 
manipulated in order to clear th amount from the totalizing mechanism simultaneously with the printing or the result on the paper tape. 
 When the subtraction key 9 is depressed, the pin I 4| engages with the cam surface I38 when the key lever I4! moves downwardly and the levers I31, I38 are thereby rocked to the right from the position shown in Fig. 9. This results in rocking the pitman I25 clockwise, so that upon the ensuing cycle of the machine, the pitman will displace the bevel gear mountings 26 to their "Subtract positions, so that the bevel gears 28" engage with the bevel gears 30 of the toializer mechanism. For setting the electric motor into operation there is the same mechanism for the subtract key as for the add key. 
 On the rotation' of the main shaft 36 that is thereby produced, the amount set up on the keyboard is subtracted from the like amount appearing in the totalizer mechanism, and this results in clearing the totalizer. The corresponding setting of the type wheels takes place at the same time, so that the result is printed on the paper tape during the oscillating movement of the platon cylinder. 
 As the sign type selecting lever H3 has been brought as above mentioned into the dotted line position shown in Fig. 8, the cooperating sign type carrying bar III can move upwardly on upward movement of the restraining and restoring bail BI, 62 until the nose II2 contacts the step H3. This results in the respective type wheel being turned so that the sign is set opposite the platen cylinder. The sign consequently ap pears opposite the result transferred to the paper tape, so that the calculation as printed on the paper tape looks like this: 
 In order that the sign type selecting hand lever I" may not have to be specially brought-back to the initial position when there are further addition calculations to be made, the lever I4! is provided with a rectangular flange I45", Fig. 7, that extends into the path of oscillation of the printer lever I'll. When, on upward movement of the restraining and restoring ball 8!, 82, the printer lever III is rocked to the left as shown in Fig. 7, it impinges against the extension I45" at the end of this counter-clockwise movement and restores the hand lever into the initial position as shown in Fig. 7 and the spring actuated nose I 50 thereby snaps into the seat I49. The pin I44 is also released together with the sign type selecting lever H8, 50 that this lever is now subjected to the action of the spring IIB. As soon as the rack bar III is again moved into the initial position on the return movement of the d011- ble armed lever 62 into its initial position, the nose I I 2' releases the bottom part of the lever I I8 so that this can now swing backinto the initial position as shown in Fig. 8. 
Recording subtraction items 'justed by the depending arm I2I and the rod II6 so that the step I I3" of the sign type selecting lever is brought into the range of movement oi the nose I I2. On the upward movement of the bail II, 82, the rack bar III can move upwardly until the nose 2' impinges against the step In this case, the corresponding type wheel I09 is moved so that the type provided with the sign comes in front or the platen cylinder I55. It, for example, 888" has been deducted in a calculation, this is recorded on the p p r tape as follows; 
course, suillcient to make the type wheels with eleven spaces, in which case the one blank type would have to take up the initial position indicated in Fig. 20. by a. Of course the tooth relation between the racks l4 and the spur gears Illl would have to be arranged in such a way that when, roiexample,-the nose It! impinges against the top step of the stepped scroll plate 40, the 
respective type wheel positions the type "9" o pos site the platen cylinder. 
Release of recording mechanism It calculations are to be made on the machine without the keyed amounts being printed, then it is only necessary to move the clutch controlling hand lever 10 to the left until it comes in front or the letter R. The intermediate gearin 01-00 is thereby disconnected and the electric motor is coupled to drive the calculating drive shaft l or the calculating machine more rapidly. The coupling 12', I02 is also released at the same time, so that the crank 10 remains in the position or rest during the rotations of the main calculatins shaft 00. 
Dampmomechanism In order to compensate to some extent for the irregular loads imposed upon the machine drive, there is provided an air damper which consists of. a dash pot I00 (Figs. 2 and 2A) pivotally positioned on the machine frame at I00. In this dash pot there is installed the piston Ill whose piston rod I02 is pivoted at I00 to an arm I04 fast on the shaft 80 that is located in the machine irame. The air pressure in the chamber formed between the end wall of the dash pot and the face of the piston is controlled by an adiustable valve I00. On the movement of the piston rod I02 to the left, as seen in Fig. 2, which takes place on the lifting of the bail BI, 02, the piston moves ireely. 0n the downward movement 0! the ball I I 82, which causes a movement or the piston rod I02 to the right, however, the air cushion in iront of the piston comes into ac tion and it is possible to adjust the outlet valve I00 according to the amount 01 damping desired. 
Recording of multiplication or division calculations 01 course multiplication or division calculations may also be registered or recorded with the new device. 
In this case, one may proceed as follows: 
 With the clutch. control lever 15 in its right hand position, themultiplier is set up on the keyboard and is recorded by manipulation of the "Add" key 0, after which the multiplicand is set up on the keyboard and likewise set down on paper I by manipulation of the add key. Thereupon the hand lever I5 is shifted to R and the set multiplicand retained set up on the keyboard. After the totalizing and revolutions counter mechanisms hav been cleared, the set multipllcand canbe multiplied by the previously written down amount of the multiplier by corresponding manipulation of the add key. The result that appears in the totalizing mechanism is transferred to the keyboard and printed in the already described manner. 
 In order to properly distinguish the individual amounts, it is in this case advisable to provide the sign printing type wheel I08 with an additional :n" type which is associated with the multiplier by insertion of a special setting device. 
 In the embodiment shown as an example, the arrangement is devised in such a way that one can both calculate and also calculate and record.
