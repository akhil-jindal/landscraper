 Claims. 
 This invention relates to computing machines and more particularly to machines of this-class that are used in merchandising transactions and the like and to automatic cycling mechanism therefor. 
 Generally these machines record individual purchases together with the totals thereof upon a slip that is handed to the customer as a record of the transaction. It is customary to print a unit count opposite each item and to print the total unit count opposite the total amount on the sales slip. Often, it is necessary to print and accumulate a tax amount such as a sales tax, the procedure being to first take a sub-total of the items purchased, mentally compute the percentage tax thereon and index the tax on the amount keys for accumulation on the totalizer and printing on the slip preparatory to taking the totals. Since the tax amount is entered last, it is desirable to have the machine automatically cycle to print the totals immediately following its entry, so that manipulations of the conventional motor bar and total key are eliminated, and speed of operation thereby increased. 
 It is an object of the present invention therefore, to provide a construction whereby operation of a single manipulative member, such as a tax key, immediately following the setting up of an amount on the keyboard, will cause the machine to operate three cycles; the first cycle accumulating the tax amount set up on the keyboard, 
the second cycle preparing the machine for taking totals, and the third cycle resetting the totalizer and printing the totals of the items and item counts on the work sheet. 
 Another object of the invention is to provide a means for automatically advancing the tally or work sheet to a point where printed totals will lie above the tear plate, ready for severance from the supply roll. 
 With these and incidental objects in view, the invention consists in certain novel features of construction and combinations of parts, the essential elements of which are set forth in appended claims, and a preferred embodiment of which is hereinafter described with reference to the drawings which accompany and form part of the specification.

 The invention is shown as applied to a machine of the character disclosed in U. S. Pats. Nos. 1,198,487, 1,583,102, 1,925,735, 1,934,747, 1,965,611, 2,088,982, 2,251,099, and 2,251,100. 
Operating mechanism generally This is an improvement on the machines disclosed in the above-enumerated patents. The machine is operated by an electric motor 6 (Figures 1 and 3) under the control of the various operation control keys including the motor bar 2 which serves as a dual add and subtotal key, the dual nonadd-total key 3, the subtract key 4 and the tax key 5. The shaft of the motor is suitably connected to a worm 5 (Figure 3) meshing with a driving gear 1 freely rotatable on a driven shaft 8. The opposite end of shaft 8 is operatively connected to the main rock shaft ii of the computing machine by suitable crank arm connections such as disclosed in Patents Nos. 1,925,736 and 2,251,100. Gear 1 has an extended hub 82 having a series of notches H! in its periphery. 
 The means for communicating movement from the driving gear 1 to the driven shaft 8 includes the disk 84 fixed on the outer end of the driven shaft 8. A dog i5, pivoted upon the inner surface of disk 54, has depending lug l5 arranged to engage notches 83 of hub iii. A spring i1, connected to the end of the dog, constantly'urges the dog counter-clockwise tending to effect engagement with one of the notches. 
 Engagement of the dog with hub 12 causes plate i4, together with shaft 8, to rotate with the driving gear 1. When shaft 8 is so rotated, it imparts oscillatory movement to the main rock shaft ii through the crank connections above mentioned. 
 Engagement of the dog is controlled by a plunger stop i8 mounted for reciprocal vertical movement substantially in the plane of movement of the dog |5. The lower end of stop i8 normally lies in the path of a lug 2| formed integral with an extended portion of dog l5. Abutment of lug 2| against stop l8 rocks dog l5 clockwise against the tension of spring l1, disengaging the clutch so that normally shaft 8 is disconnected from driving gear I. As hereafter will appear, stop |8 may be raised under the control of any of the above-mentioned operation controlling keys including motor bar 2, in a manner to be later explained, to permit engagement between the driving and driven members. Motor bar 2 is tensi-oned upwardly by a spring 22 connected between the stem of the motor bar and the machine frame. A plate 23, slidably mounted on studs 24 secured in the stem of the motor bar and connected for movement with the motor bar by a spring 25, is pivoted at its lower end to a crank arm 25 of a transversely extending rod 21, mounted within a slot 28 in the base of the computing machine. The opposite end of rod 21 is pivoted to a link 3|. The rear end of link a: is pivoted at 32 to a bell crank 33 pivoted at 34. The opposed arm of hell crank 33 is pivoted to a slide 35 that is guided for vertical movement. The upper end of slide 35 is pivoted at 35 (Figure 4) to one end of a lever 31 pivoted at 38 in a post 4| fixed in the motor housing. The opposite end of lever 31 is pivoted in a slot 42 provided in the upper end of stop l8. 
 When the parts are in the normal position shown in Figure 3, spring 22 serves not only to hold the motor bar in its upper position. but also, through the linkage just described, normally holdsstop It in its lower eifective position. Upon the depression of the motor bar, rod 21 rocks clockwise, pulling link 3! toward the right, in turn rocking bell crank 33 counter-clockwise to pull slide 35 downwardly and raise stop l8 out of the path of lug 2|, to release dog I5 for engagement with notches i3. 
 The opening and closing of the motor circuit is controlled by a pair of electrical contacts 43 that are permitted to close under the control of lever 44 pivoted at 45. Lever 44 is arranged to be raised and lowered to control the opening and closing of the contacts by engagement and disengagement of lug 2| incident to engagement and disengagement of dog i5. In this manner, the driving means is maintained normally idle so as to prevent unnecessary wear and to conserve power. 
 This mechanism is identical with that disclosed in the aforementioned Patents Nos. 1,925,735 and 2,251,100. 7 
 By these parts, depression of motor bar 2 against the tension of spring 22 causes the machine to operate through one cycle. However, if the motor bar is held depressed so that the tension of spring 22 is not effective to return it and its associated Parts. at the end of the operation, 
the machine continues operating until the motor bar is released. 
 Operation of the motor under the control of the various control keys will be described in conjunction with specific operations to be later described. 
Indexing, diflerential and printing mechanism The following mechanisms are similar to the corresponding mechanisms disclosed in Patents Nos. 1,583,102 and 1,965,611, so that explanation thereof will be made only in a general way. 
 Amounts to be entered in the machine are indexed on the amount keys 45 (Figures 1, 2 and 5), which, through a vertical row of horizontally disposed push pins 41, set index pins 48 to the rear a distance sufllcicnt for their rear ends to lie in the plane of a series of rods such as 5| (see also Figure 13). Rods 5| are slidable vertically in a frame 52 slidable along a rod53 from left to right in the machine. The lower ends oi. 
rods 5| are connected to arms 54, pivoted to type bars 55 mounted for vertical movement in the machine. A series of type 55 are carried by each type bar to cooperate with a platen '50 to print amounts and totals. A series of hammers such as 51 and their customary controls are provided to effect printing. Two sets of racks 58 and 59 (Figure 5) are suspended from arms 52, extending rearwardly from type bars 55, to actuate a totalizer comprising a. series of pinions 53 mounted on a shaft 54. The type bars and actuating racks are raised and lowered by levers 55 connected to type bars 55, levers 55 in turn being actuated by drive shaft II. The connection between shaft and levers 55 includes a'plate 55 (Figure 9) and a link 81 pivoted to plate 88 and to a stud 88 in one of a pair of similar levers II pivoted on studs such as 12. Levers 85 are nexibly connected to levers 'II by springs I8 (Figure and other parts fully disclosed in Patent No. 1,965,611. 
 As the amount keys 48 are depressed, a suitable escapement causes frame 52 to move from left to right (Figure 13) one step for each amount key depressed, placing rods 5|, one at a time beneath the set pins 48 (Figure 5). Also, push pins 41 move from left to right with frame 52 so that only one pin 48 in each vertical row may be set. 
 As the first amount k is depressed, a universal rod I4 (Figure 5) on the indexing mechanism moves a lever I5 (Figure 13) clockwise about its pivot 18 to move a plate 11 a slight extent about its pivot I8. The pivot 18 consists of two screws passing through large openings in the plate, there being sufilcient clearance between the plate and the machine frame to allow the plate to pivot. Movement of plate 11 clockwise (rearwardly in the machine) moves the forward end 8i of a plate 82 rearwardly in the machine. As shown in Figure 15, plate 82 is pivotally connected at 83 to a frame 84 composed of two similar members, one on each side of the machine, pivoted on a rod 85 and connected by a rod 86 for uniform movement. Springs such as 81 connected to the upper ends of members 84 tend to move plate 82 forward, but are prevente'dby a spring detent 88 (Figures 14 and 15) Rearward movement of plate 82 places the end 8| above rods 5i, so that during the printing of an item only the rods that are moved to the right of the plate are permitted to rise during the machine cycle. In this manner, only the type bars necessary to print the digits of an indexed number are allowed to rise from their zero positions. 
Totalizer engaging and disengaging mechanism To engage and disengage the totalizer with actuating racks 58 and 59, shaft 64 is moved forwardly and rearwardly in the machine (left and right in Figure 5). To shift the totalizer in this manner, plate 66 (Figure 9) has pivoted thereon at 82 a pawl 83. Pawl 83 engages studs 84 and 85 on the initial and return strokes of drive shaft II to oscillate the plate 88 carrying studs 84 and 85, first counter-clockwise, then clockwise about its pivot 81 during each machine cycle. Oscillation of plate 98 moves a stud 88, embraced by a cam slot in plate 98, and a link I8I (Figure 5) to the left and then to the right, stud 98 being carried by a link I82 pivoted at I83, and connecting the forward end of link I M with link I82. Link I8I at its rear end has two notches to cooperate with two studs I84 and I85 on one of two similar levers I88 secured to a shaft I81 journaled in the machine frame. Two identical links I88 connect levers I88 with the totalizer shaft 84. During adding operations, link I 8| is connected with stud I85, so that movement of link IM to the left, at the beginning of an operation, moves the totalizer from the position shown in Figure 5, where it is engaged with adding racks 59, to its disengaged position, where it lies midway between racks 58 and 58. Movement of link IM to the right, at the beginning of the second half of a cycle, returns the totalizer to the position shown in Figure 5. 
 Depression of subtract key 4 (Figure 16) rocks a lever I88 counter-clockwise about its pivot H8 and causes the rear end of the lever to engage a pin III fixed in a bail H2. Ball 2 (Figure 19) is mounted for vertical movement on studs H8 and is arranged to be oscillated upon the studs during each cycle of the machine by a connection I I4 with lever II. The lower end of the bail carries a yieldingly supported projection H5 which is elevated into the path of a stud II8 secured on a slide Ill when the ball is raised as above described. Slide II! is yieldingly connected by a pin and slot connection II8 (Figure 16) and by a spring Hi to a lever I22 pivoted at I23 in the machine frame and having a pin and slot connection I24 with link I8I. When bail II2 rocks clockwise during the fore part of a cycle, projection III strikes stud H8 and thrusts slide III rearwardly stretching spring I2I. The stretching of spring I2I tensions the rear end of link I8I upwardly, so that when it is given its movement to the left at the beginning of an peration, the upper notch in the link engages stud I84. The subsequent movement of link IN to the right thereupon moves the totalizer into engagement with racks 58 (Figure 5) for subtracting. This structure, apart from lever I88 and its connection with subtract key 4 for independent manipulation of bail H2, is identical with that used in the conventional overdraft mechanism fully disclosed in Patent No. 2,088,982. 
Adding and subtracting Motor bar 2 serves as an add key, only when it is depressed following the indexing of an amount on the amount keys. To add, an item is indexed on amount keys 48 and motor bar 2 depressed. Oscillation of drive shaft II (Figure 9) through pawl 93 and stud 84 disengages the totalizer from the actuating racks. During the remainder of the first half of the cycle, type bars 55 (Figure 5) rise difierentially under control of the index pins 48, actuating racks 58 and 58 rising with the type bars. At the beginning of the last half of the cycle, pawl 83 (Figure 10) engages stud 85, returning plate 86, link I8I, lever I86, links I88 and the totalizer to their positions shown in Figure 5 where the totalizer is engaged with the adding racks 59. During the remainder of the last half of the cycle, the type bars and actuating racks are lowered to the position shown in Figure 5, entering on the totalizer the amount indexed on the keyboard. 
 For subtracting, the same movements take place except that at the beginning of the last half of the cycle, due to the fact that the rear end of link I8I is tensioned upwardly by depression of the subtract key 4, the link is engaged with stud I84 instead of stud I85, engaging the totalizer with subtracting racks 58. This rotates the totalizer in the opposite direction, causing the number indexed on the keyboard to be subtracted from the totalizer. Initiation of a machine cycle by depression of subtract key 4 is eifected by a pin I28 (Figure 16) on the stern of the subtract key 4 lying above a spring tensioned arm I3I pivoted at I32 to plate 23 and tensioned counter-clockwise by a spring I3Ia. 
By this connection, depression of key 4 depresses plate 23 against the tension of inferior spring 25 (Figure 3) to operate the cycling mechanism in the same manner as when motor bar 2 is depressed. 
 During adding and subtracting operations, a latch mechanism cooperating with the operation controlling keys is eifective to hold either subtract key 4 or motor bar 2 depressed until the single cycle necessary for an adding or a subtracting operation is completed. This mechanism comprises a latch slide I33 (Figure 6) having a notch I34 arranged to engage a stud I35 fixed in the stem of motor bar 2 and a notch I36 arranged to engage a stud I31 fixed in the stem of subtract key 4. Slide I33 is mounted for slight longitudinal movement by screws I38 passing through elongated openings MI in the slide and secured in the side walls of the keyboard housing. A hook I42 is pivoted at I48 to the slide. The hook I42 is tensioned clockwise by a spring I43 secured between a projection of the hook and a stud I44 fixed in the housing, and rests against a reduced portion of a stud I45 fixed on a sliding link I46. Thus, spring I43 tensions slide I33 forwardly. 
 Link I46 is slidably mountedupon stud I44 at its forward end and is bifurcated at its rearward end to slidably embrace rock shaft II adjacent arm 66. An upstanding lug I41 formed on the extreme rear end of link I46 is arranged to abut a pin I48 secured in arm 66. A spring I5I urges link I46 forwardly and holds lug I41 in contact with pin I48. When motor bar 2 or subtract key 4 is depressed, stud I35 or stud I31 engages notch I34 or notch I36 of slide I33 as it comes forward under the tension of spring I43, latching the motor bar or the key down. 
 As the machine cycles, on the forward stroke, arm 66 swings upwardly, moving pin I 48 away from lug I41 allowing link I46 to move forward under the tension of spring I5I, whereupon stud I45 is brought into operative engagement with hook I42. On the return strokeof the instant cycle, arm 66 swings downwardly, bringing pin I48 against lug I41, pulling link I46 and slide I33 (by virtue of its engagement with hook I42) rearwardly, and retracting notch I34 from stud I35 or notch I36 from stud I31, whereupon the depressed key rises to normal position. As slide I33 moves farther rearwardly, a projection I52 on book I42 strikes a stationary lug I53, swing-v ing hook I42 counter-clockwise about its pivot I48, disengaging it from stud- I45, whereupon slide-I33 restores to its normal position under the influence of spring I43. 
Item counter Mechanism is provided to automatically effect a count of 1 for each item accumulated on the totalizer. Two wheels I 54 (Figure 15A) to the left of the amount accumulating wheels 63 are allocated to counting items, the transfer lug of the highest order wheel of the amount accumulating wheels being removed so as to prevent a carry from this wheel to the units order wheel of the item counter. The rod 5I (Figure 15) associated with the units order type bar I55 of the item counter is so positioned in frame 52 that indexing of an amount on amount keys 46 will never remove this rod from beneath plate 82. This rod 5|, as shown in Figure 15, is shorter than the'conventional rods 5|, so that as the type bars and racks ascend during the fore part of a cycle, its type bar I55 rises to the 1 printing position instead of to the usual printing position. Hence, upon descent of the bars and racks during the second half of the cycle, the "1 just printed is accumulated on the units order wheel I54 of the item counter. The tens order bar I56 of the item counter has no arm 54 and rod connected with it, but is prevented from rising above zero printing position during accumulating cyclesby a detent I51 mounted for movement with the swinging frame 84. Rear, 
ward movement of plate 82, incident to the indexing of an amount on the amount keys, swings frame 84 rearwardly from the position shown in Figure 15 and places the lower end I58 of detent I51 above a stud I6I secured in the tens order type bar I56. During total-taking operations, plate 82 and detent I51 occupy the positions shown in Figure 15 so that bars I and I56 are free to rise and print the total amount of the item count. 
Nonadding Depression of the nonadd-total key 3 following the indexing of an amount upon amount keys 46 causes the amount to be printed, but not added on the totalizer. Referring to Figures 11 and 12, the stem of the nonadd-total key carries a pin I62 overlying a spring tensioned arm I63 pivoted to plate 23 at I32, so that depression of the key depresses plate 23 against the tension of spring 25 (Figure 3) to operate the cycling mechanism in the same manner as when either motor bar 2 or subtract key 4 are depressed. Key 3 is latched in its depressed position by engaging a notch I64 (Figure 6) in the forward end of latch slide I33. Operation of slide I33 by engagement of hook I 42 with stud I45 near the end of the cycle releases key 3 similarly to the release of keys 2 and 4 as above described in connection with adding and subtracting operations. 
 An arm I66 (Figure 13) on the stem of key 3 overlies the forward end of a bell crank I61 pivoted on a stud I66. Bell crank I61 is normally tensioned clockwise about stud I68 by a spring I and carries a flange I12 that normally lies behind a shoulder I13 (Figure 12) formed on a slide I14. Slide I14 is mounted on studs I15 and is urged toward the right as viewed in Figures 11 and 12 by a spring I16. When the machine is in normal position, the forward end of an oscillating arm I11, connected by a link I18 to lever 1I, strikes the left end of slide I14 and thrusts it toward the left so that shoulder I13 lies to the left of flange I12. Depression of key 3, through arm I66, rocks, bell crank I61 counter-clockwise against the tension of spring I1 I, removing flange I12 from the path of shoulder I13 as shown in Figure 12. Upon the cycle being initiated by depression of key 3, arm I11 oscillates counter-clockwise and slide I14 moves toward the right its full extent of movement. This full movement of the slide brings a pro: jection I8I (Figure 11), formed on the right end thereof, into the path of movement of a pin I82 secured in pawl 93. Engagement of pin I82 against projection I8I withholds the pawl from engaging stud 95. Consequently, during the second half of the cycle, the totalizer is withheld from engaging adding racks 59 so that the amount just printed is nonadded upon the totalizer. 
Toward the end of the instant cycle, as arm I11 oscillates clockwise, it strikes the right end of slide I14 and thrusts it leftwardly so that shoulder I13.is again placed to the left of flange I12, flange I12 restoring to its normal position as shown in Figure 11, concurrently with the reorder that the totaiizer may be engaged with the proper set of racks 59, or 58, for taking a positive or negative total, a means is provided for enforcing a blank cycle before a total can be taken. To do this, all the rods I (Figures 5, 13 and 15) are held against rising during the firstcycle following an operation where one or more amount keys were not depressed. This is accomplished by leaving the end 8I (Figure 13) of plate 82, at the end of an accumulating operation, in its rear position where it overlies rods 8|. With plate 82 overlying rods 5|, the type bars are held from rising, so that a total cannot be taken during this cycle. During such a blank operation, as explained in Patent No. 1,583,102, plate 82 is moved forwardly to its po. sition shown in Figures 13 and 15, so that a total can be taken in the following operation. 
Taking a total Depression of the nonadd-total key 3 with no amount indexed upon amount keys 48 initiates a double cycle of the machine, the first cycle being a blank cycle and the second cycle being an automatically initiated total cycle. The first cycle is initiated by the depression of plate 23 in the same manner as in.a non-adding operation, stud I85 on the stem of key 3 becoming latched in notch I84 on slide I33 (Figure 6). The second cycle is eflected by a slide I83 (Figures 6, 7 and 8) mounted on studs I38 and normally tensioned toward the left against stud I45 by a spring I84. Whenever slide I83 is permitted to move leftwardly its full extent of movement during a cycle, a succeeding cycle is automatically initiated. Slide I83 is controlled by the following parts. An arm I85 is secured to one end of a rod I88. The opposite end of rod I88 carries a finger I81 (Figure 15) tensioned rearwardly by a spring I88. The lower end of finger I8'I normally bears against a roller I9I carried by a slide bar I92. Bar I92 corresponds to the bar I2 shown in Patent No. 1,198,487, and, as disclosed in that patent, is arranged to be moved step by step away from finger I81 whenever an item is indexed upon the amount keys and is restored to its normal position shown in Figure 15 during the return stroke of every cycle of the machine. Upon indexing the first digit of an amount on the amount keys, arm I85 moves upwardly to the dotted line position shown in Figure 6 under tension of spring I88. This movement places the right end of the arm in front of a flange I93 on slide I83 and thereby prevents the slide from full leftward movement as link I48 moves to the left so that a second cycle is not initiated during adding, subtracting and non-adding operations because in all of these operations an amount is indexed on the amount keys. 
 When no amount is indexed upon the amount keys, arm I85 remains in the full line position shown in Figure 6 and consequently, during the blank cycle, slide I83 is not blocked from moving leftwardly. During its leftward movement, a flange I94 on the right end of slide I83 engages the right end of hook I42, as shown in Figure 7, and prevents the hook from moving downwardly into engagement with stud I45, so that when stud I45 moves to the right during the latter part of the cycle, it will pass under the hook I42. During the last part of the cycle, stud I45 moves slide I83 to the right to its original position. This return movement of slide I83, however, oo- 
far to the right to engage the vertical face of hook I42, so that slide I33 remains effective to hold key 3 depressed, and thereby causes a. second cycle, during which the total is taken. Durof the first half of the total-taking cycle. 
curs after the reduced portion of stud I45 is too ing the blank cycle, as plate 11 (Figure 15) moves forwardly, it strikes an upstanding arm I yieldingly pivoted on one end of a link I98, and thrusts the link forwardly. The opposite end of link I98 is pivoted to an arm I91 secured on one end of a rod I98. An arm 2III, preferably of flat spring stock, is secured on the opposite end of rod I98, and a spring I99connected thereto normally tensions arm 28I and rod I98 clockwise and link I98 toward the rear. Incident to the forward thrust of plate TI and link I98, arm 28I is yieldingly tensioned downwardly against the tension of spring I99, upon a flange 282 provided on the left -end of slide I83, as shown in Figure 7. Immediately upon slide I83 being fully restored to the right at the end of the blank cycle, arm 28I descends in front of flange 282 as shown in Figure 8. Hence, during the ensuing total cycle, slide I83 is blocked against movement toward the left, and consequently hook I42 is permitted to engage stud I45 to move slide I33 to the right and release total key 3. 
 Depression of key 3 also lowers a stud 283 (Figure 13), connected thereto, from a position directly beneath a lever 284, so that lever 284 will be free to pivot counter-clockwise on stud I88 during a, total cycle, under tension of a spring 285 connected to the forward end of the lever. 
 Movement of plate 82 forwardly to its position shown in Figure 13, during the blank cycle, moves frame 84 forward with it. Forward movement of frame 84, through a rod 288, moves a lever 281 counter-clockwise about its pivot 288, by reason of the end of rod 288 lying within a slot in lever 281. This movement of lever 281 causes a flange 2II thereon (Figure 9) to strike pawl 93 and move it sufliciently to prevent it from cooperating with stud 94 at the beginning of the total-taking cycle. Thereafter, the total- .izer remains engaged with the actuating racks To disengage the totalizer after the wheels are returned to zero, plate 98 is moved counterclockwise by counter-clockwise movement of bell crank I25, as mentioned above, at the very end To do this, the following construction is provided. 
 A cam lever 2I2, pivoted at 2I8 and having a slot 2I3 (Figure 9), embraces stud 88, and is provided with a notch 2 I 4 on its lower edge. Another cam lever 2I5 is likewise pivoted at 2I8, and is tensioned counter-clockwise by a spring 2I8. Lever 2I5 has a. cam edge 2II that bears against the lower side of stud 88 under the tension of spring 2I8, and has a short cam slot 2I8 in its lower edge and a hook 22I at its upper end. A lever 222 is pivoted on a. rod 223 and is tensioned counter-clockwise by a spring 224, the counter-clockwise movement of the lever being controlled by stud 88, upon which the lower edge of the lever rests. Lever 222 carries a stud 225 which normally lies out of the path of hook 22I. During accumulating operations, and during the blank cycle preceding the total taking cycle-in shown in Figure 9. During these operations, the forward movement of stud 68, during the first half of the machine cycle, allows lever 222 to move a sufficient distance counter-clockwise to bring stud 225 into the path of hook 22I. Then upon stud 68 reaching its forward extremity, 
where it moves lever 2I2 counter-clockwise because of the configuration of the left end of cam slot 2I3, notch 2 is placed directly above a stud 221 secured to the rear end of lever 204 and resting on the lower edge of lever 2I5, as shown in Figure 12. However, since stud 225 is in the path of hook 22I, lever. 2I5 is held against counter-clockwise movement. Stud 221, therefore, does not rise into notch 2I4, but remains held in its lower position by lever 2I5. Lever 204 is therefore not operated during these cycles. 
 During the total-taking cycle, however, frame 84 and lever 20! are in their forward positions where stud 226 lies directly under the forward end of lever 222, as shown in Figure 11. Therefore, when stud 68 moves forward, lever 2I5 is free to move counter-clockwise. 
 As stud 68 completes its forward movement, lever 2I2 moves counter-clockwise as mentioned above, placing notch 2I4 above stud 221. Since lever 2I5 also has moved counter-clockwise, to the position shown in Figure 11, stud 221 rises into notch 2I4, whereupon further counterclockwise movement of lever 2I5, through its spring 2I6, moves slot 2I8 into engagement with stud 221, locking the stud in notch 2I4. This rising of stud 221 is accompanied by a sufficient, rising of the rear portion of lever 204 to place a, shoulder 228 thereon immediately behind a stud 23I secured in the vertical arm of bell crank I25, as shown in Figure 13. This slight rocking of lever 204 is caused by the tension of spring 205. 
 During the first part of the second half of the cycle, stud 68 moves lever 2I2 clockwise to the position shown in Figure 13, moving stud 221 and lever 204 forwardly. This causes shoulder 228 to rock bell crank I25 counter-clockwise, moving plate 86 counter-clockwise, as desired, to disenage the totalizer from the actuating rack before they are lowered to their normal positions. The totalizer now stands at zero. 
 During the remainder of the cycle, stud 68 moves lever 2| 5 clockwise to its position shown in Figure 9. This cams stud 221 downwardly out of notch 2l4, whereupon a spring 232, connected to lever 204 pulls the lever and stud 221 to their rear positions shown in Figure 9. During the last portion of the cycle, arm I21 strikes lug I28, and moves plate 96 clockwise, to its position shown in Figure 9 leaving the totalizer engaged with the actuating racks at the end of the operation. 
Taking a subtotal Subtotals are taken by depressing motor bar 2 with noamount indexed upon amount keys 46. This causes a double cycle of the machine in substantially the same manner that depression of key 3 with no amount indexed upon the amount keys causes a double cycle for taking a total. That is, slide I83 (Figures 6, 7 and 8) is permitted to move toward the left (Figure 6) its full extent of movement to prevent hook I42 from engaging stud I45 (Figure 7) during the first or blank cycle, during which arm 20I is conditioned to prevent slide I83 fromfull leftward movement during the ensuing automatically initiated second cycle. Consequently, during the second cycle, following the printing of the subtotal, shoulder I34 is withdrawn from stud I35, releasing motor bar 2. During the subtotal operation, as in the total operations, the totalizer remains in engagement with the racks during the fore part of the cycle, because during the blank cycles, lever 20! is moved forwardly to the position where flange 2II withholds pawl 93 from engaging stud 94. 
 However, unlike the taking of a total, the totalizer is not disengaged from the racks following the printing of the total. This is due to the fact that the stud 203 on the nonadd total key 3 (Figure 11) is not lowered by the depression of motor bar 2. Therefore, stud 203 remains in the position shown in Figure 11 and prevents stud 221 from entering notch 2I4 and cam slot 2I8, so that the totalizer remains engaged with the racks during the second half of the cycle, and the amount printed is re-accumulated on the totalizer wheels as the racks descend. 
Three cycle operation by depression of tax key Mechanism is provided on this machine whereby, following the listing and accumulation of a group of items and the taking of a subtotal thereof, a tax amount may be indexed on amount keys 46, and by depression of a single manipulative member, namely, the tax key 5, a three cycle operation will be initiated, the first cycle accumulating the tax amount, the second cycle being a blank cycle and preparing the machine for taking a total, and the third cycle being a total cycle, clearing the totalizer for the nextoperation. 
 Referring to Figure 15, an arm 233 formed on the stem of tax key 5 overlies a flange 234 formed on the stem of nonadd total key 3 so that depression of key 5 concurrently depresses key 3, and causes stud I (Figure 6) to be engaged by notch I64 in slide I33. This depression of key 5 therefore starts a machine cycle. A lever 235 (Figure 15) pivoted at 236 is connected by a pin and slot connection 231 to an arm 238 that is also connected by a pin and slot connection 24I to the stem of the tax key. A spring 242 connected to lever 235 normally urges the lever counterclockwise about pivot 236, and holds a projection 243 and tax key 5 in their upper positions shown in Figure 15. Upon depression of key 5, however, lever 235 is swung clockwise about pivot 236 a distance sufiicient to bring the forward end of projection 243 into engagement with an angularly disposed finger 244 secured to rod I86, a notch 245 in the forward end of the projection engaging beneath the lower end of finger 244 to latch key 5 in its depressed position. Incident to the engagement of projection 243 with finger 244, shaft I86 is rocked counter-clockwise (Figure 15) an amount sufficient to lower arm I85 from the dotted line position shown in Figure 6 (to which the arm was just raised by the indexing of the tax amount) back to the full line position shown therein. Therefore, during the first cycle, slide I83 is permitted to move leftwardly its full extent of movement to prevent hook I42 from engaging stud I45, so that key 3 remains depressed to initiate a blank cycle immediately following the accumulatin cycle. During the blank cycle, arm 20I is tensioned downwardly on flange 202 in the same manner as described previously in connection with a totaltaking operation, so that at the end of the blank cycle arm 20I lies in front of flange 202 (Figure 8) to prevent full leftward movement of slide I83 during the ensuing automatically initiated total cycle. Therefore, during the total cycle hook I42 is permitted to engage stud I45 to withextending over a slot 250 in slide I14. When the key is depressed, arm 243 is lowered into slot 256 and thereby prevents slide I14 from moving to the rear during the one cycle that the tax key remains in depressed position. This allows the tax amount to be entered in the totalizer rather than being nonadded. 
Disabling item counter by depression of tax key Since it is desirable to not count the'tax amount, the following parts are provided to disable the item counter during the tax amount printing operation. Arm 236 (Figure 15) is secured to'the right end of a rod 246 extending across the machine and having an arm 241 secured on its opposite end. A link 243, pivoted at one end to arm 241, is yieldingly connected by a spring and slot connection 25I to a plate 252 pivoted at 253 in the machine frame. The lower edge of plate 252 normally lies just above and to the rear of lugs 254 secured on the lower ends of the item counter type bars I55 and I56. Depression of key rocks shaft 246, pulling link 248 forwardly and rocking plate 252 counter-clockwise on its pivot so that the lower edge of the plate is brought forwardly, over lugs 254, thus locking bars I55 and I56 against vertical movement during the tax printing and accumulation cycle. This prevents operation of the item counter during this operation. When key 5 is released at the end of the tax printing cycle, plate 252 swings back to the ineffective position shown in Figure 15, under tension of spring 242. 
Key locks Locks are provided to prevent depression of either the tax key 5 or subtract key'4 unless an amount has been indexed upon amount keys 46. Referring to Figure 14, a link 255 is connected at one end to an arm 256 secured on rod I98 and is connected at its opposite end to a latch 251 pivoted at 258 in the machine frame. When an amount is indexed upon amount keys 46, and plate 11 is thereby thrust to its rear position as shown in Figure 14, link 255 concurrently moves rearwardly. Rearward movement of link 255 withdraws a shoulder 26I on the link from beneath the lower edge of the body portion of arm 233, so that key 5 is free to be depressed. Incident to the rearward movement of link 255, latch 251 swings rearwardly to the position shown in Figure 14, removing a shoulder 262 formed on latch 251 from beneath a lug 263 secured to the stem of subtract key 4 so that this key also is free to be depressed following the indexing of an item. During a blank cycle, however, when plate 11 moves forwardly, as previously described, link 255 and latch 251 are pulled forwardly, placing shoulders 26I and 262 in effective position so that neither key may be depressed until an amount is indexed on amount keys 46. 
 Another lock is provided to prevent depression of any of the operation controlling keys 2, 3, 4, or 5 during an operation. This mechanism comprises a pair of oppositely disposed levers 264 and 265 (Figures 14 and 17) pivoted at 266 in the machine frame. Lever 264 has an upstanding lug 261 which, under the tension of a spring 268, bears against an angular edge of the flange 234 formed on the nonadd total key 3. Lever 265 has a similar upstanding lug 21I which, under tension of a spring 266, bears against the angular edge of a similar flange 212 formed on the stem of subtract key 4. 
 The inner ends of each lever 264 and 265 have upstanding lugs 213 and 214 respectively, the upper ends of which lie just below and to one side of the lower ends of separate, angularly formed projections 215 and 216 secured on the stem of motor bar 2 and plate 23 respectively. When no operation controlling key 2, 3, 4 or 5 is depressed, springs 268 and 269 withhold lugs 213 and 214 from the path of downward movement of projections 215 and 216. 
 Upon depression of the add subtotal key 2, since plate 23-is lowered therewith, projection 216 is lowered to a position wher its lower end lies immediately to the left (Figure 17) of lugs 214 and 213 thus locking keys 3, 4 and 5 against depression during adding or subtotaling operations. Referring to Figure 15, it will be noted that a locking of key 3 causes locking of key 5. 
 Depression of key 3 for either a nonadd or totaling operation cams lever 264 leftwardly against the tension of spring 268. As plate 23 and its projection 216 start to descend with key 3, plate 23 is held up by lug 213 until cam 234 has moved lug 213 to the left of projection 216. 
A strong spring I63a (Figur 12) extending between lever I63 and plate 23 permits the plate to be so held up. Lug 213 then lies directly beneath the lower end of projection 215. Hence, during nonadd or totaling operations key 2 is locked against depression by lug 213 blocking downward movement of projection 215, and key 4 is locked against depression because the lowering of projection 216 looks lever 265 against lateral movement. 
 Depression of key 4 to initiate a subtracting operation cams lever 265 leftwardly against the tension of spring 269. As plate 23 and its projection 216 start to descend, lug 214 is moved to the left of projection 216, to a position directly beneath the lower end of projection 215, spring I3Ia (Figure 16) permitting such operation. Hence, during a subtracting operation keys 2 and 3 are locked against depression in the same manner as above described, and locking of key 3 also looks key 5 as before stated. 
Symbol printing mechanism Mechanism is provided on this machine to print an appropriate symbol designating the character of the operation performed. This mechanism is similar to the symbol printing mechanisms disclosed in the before-mentioned patents. The symbol printing type bar 211 (Figure 16) is stopped in different elevations to print the debit total, minus, and credit total symbols by mechanism controlled by the corresponding operation controlling keys. 'This mechanism may be similar to that disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 2,251,099. 
Type bar 211 is also stopped in a position to printa tax symbol whenever tax key 5 is de-' pressed. To do this, 2. lug 216 is formed on the lower end of type bar 211 and lies in a position to be stopped by the lower edge of plate 252 whenever the plate is swung toward the left (Figure 16) by the key 5 being depressed. There is just sufficient distance between lug 218 and plate 252 to permit the type bar to rise to tax symbol printing position. 
The symbol printing hammer 51 (Figure 13) is controlled in its operation in identically the some manner as disclosed in the before-mentioned patents. 
Paper feeding mechanism Mechanism is provided on this machine to advance the paper a single line space following an adding, subtracting, nonadding, subtotaling and tax printing operations, and to advance it a greater distance following a total printing operation, so that the printed total will lie above the tear plate. This permits the operator to tear the tape from the supply roll without manually rotating platen This mechanism includes a ratchet wheel 285 (Figure 18) secured on the right end or" the platen shaft. Wheel Elli is engaged by a rack i282? pivoted at 283 to one arm of a lever pivoted at A spring connected between the lower end of rack 282 and lever normally tensions the teeth on the rack into mesh with l the teeth on ratchet wheel 2336. A spring 20?, connected to a depending arm 2% of lever 28d, normally tensions the lever clockwise about pivot 285, and holds the lower end of arm 2% against stud 88. A stud 29E secured in the right end of lever 28d lies above a shoulder 292 in a lever 2S3 pivoted at 2%. The lower end of lever 293 is forked (see Figure 19) and embraces an upstanding lug 295 formed on the end of a slide 2953. Slide 296 is tensioned toward the left by a spring 2% (Figure 18), but is restrained from leftward movement whenever lever 213i is in its rearmost position by an upstanding finger 298 formed on the slide and bearing against a pin 3M secured in lever 20?. The forward end of slide 295 is pivoted at 3B2 to one arm of a bell crank 303 pivoted at Sti l in the machine frame. The opposite arm of bell crank 3% lies a short distance below stud H5 in add subtotal key 2. 
 During adding, subtracting, nonadding and tax printing operations, lever Zlli occupies its rearmost position as previously described, and pin 3! restrains slide 296 from moving left-'- wardly, so that shoulder 292 is held in the path of movement of stud 29L Therefore, as lever Ii swings clockwise during the fore part of a cycle, lever 28d swings only slightly clockwise; about pivot 285. This movement is just suflicient to permit rack 282 to advance one tooth on ratchet wheel 28L Consequently, when arm Ii swings counter-clockwise during the latter part of the cycle, and stud 68 swings lever 284 counterclockwise, rack 282 advances platen 50 a single line space. 
 Depression of add subtotal key 2 to initiate a subtotal-taking operation lowers stud I35 to a position where it blocks movement of bell crank. 
- and withdraws shoulder 292 from the path of movementof-stud 29!. Hence, during the ensuing total cycle rack 282 is permitted to rise to a point where its lowest tooth engages ratchet wheel 28l, so that upon restoration of the parts to normal, platen 50 is rotated several line spaces. This advances the paper to a point where the total, just printed, lies above the tear plate 305. 
 A spring tensioned plate 306 pivoted at 391 and having beveled upper and lower edges cooperates with a. pin 308 secured in the upper end of rack 282 in such manner as to cam the rack out of engagement with the teeth of the ratchet wheel during the up stroke of the rack, and to permit the teeth of the rack to reengage the teeth of the ratchet wheel during the down stroke.
