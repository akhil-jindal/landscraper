ration of Delaware Buffalo, N. Y., a corpo- Applcation October 25, 19.38, Serial No. 236,854 19 Claims. '(Cl. 23S-59) This invention relates to recording and computing machineaand its object generally stated, is to provide improved means for recording one digit at a time, typewriter fashion, the totals registered on a totalizer. The more immediate and specific object of the invention, in the form vherein described, is to provide improved means -for enabling an ordinary power-operated combined typewriting and computing machine, such for example as the electrified Remington bookkeeping machine, to print its own totals by the usual typewriting mechanism automatically, with little or no intervention by the operator of the machine. 
 Automatically operating apparatus for causing a typewriting and computing machine to print its own totals, are known, but some of them have imperfections to cure which is an object of this invention, and they have limitations which it is proposed to extend. One object of the invention is to provide various improvements in electrical circuits for accomplishing the purpose specified. Another object is to provide improved means for sensing the totalizer wheels as to the digits registered by them. Another object is to render the apparatus more reliable and certain in its operation. Various other objects will be apparent from the specification and claims. 
 To the above ends, the invention consists in certain devices and combinations and arrangements of devices both mechanical and electrical and in certain features of construction, all of which will be described herein and pointed out in the claims. 
 The controls for causing the machine to record its own totals are preferably electrical and they are so shown in the present instance; but some of the features of the invention are also applicable to mechanical apparatus. The invention includes improved means for sensing the wheels of the totalizer, which act rapidly and are reliable in their operation. It also includes improved means for sensing the state of the totalizer as to the sign of the total, and highly eflicient and quick acting means for shifting the circuit so as to print the true complement of a number registered in the totalizer. This makes it unnecessary to provide fugitive one mechanism in the totalizer, i 
 Machines of the type of the Remington bookkeeping machine are frequently hooked up to a punch to punch.records in statistical cards, as described in numerouspatents such, for example, as that to Weiland and Russell, No. 1,682,451, dated August 28, 1928, and that to Lasker. Patent 2,124,178, issued July 19, 1938. Obviously such a punch could be connected with the machine herein described, in which event the totals would be automatically recorded,'not only by printing them on the typewriter but also by punching them in cards or tapes. The Powers punch described in said patents itself includes digital solenoids to control the punches, a carriage and means foi` spacing the latter. The present electrical system is, as to many of its features, applicable directly to such a punch. The invention is, therefore, not limited to printing as a recording means. 
 A patent issued to George G. Going, September 12, 1939, No. 2,172,749, and also a patent issued to Frederick W. Schremp, July 7, 1942, No. 2,288,846, describe and claim certain improvements in automatic total writing apparatus including electric circuits and shown applied to the Remington bookkeeping machine, and said patents may contain claims reading on some feature of the constructions described herein.

 In the drawings the invention is shown applied to an electrified Remington bookkeeping machine. This machine is well known in the art and has been described in a series of patents, and only s much of the machine is shown in the present drawings as is necessary to an understanding of the invention and its application thereto. Said machine includes a Remington typewriter, fragments of whose frame 50 are shown in the drawings. 
 Referring to Fig. 1, the typewriter carriage 5| supports a platen frame 52 carrying a platen 53. The type bars I are operated by sub-levers 55. The sub-levers which operate alphabetical type bars are operated by levers 56 and those that operate numerical type bars by levers 51, which, together with the alphabetic key levers 58 and numerical key levers 60 are all pivoted on an angle bar 6I at the rear of the machine. All of these type bars are operated by a power drive located in a base section on the frame 62 in which the typewriter frame is mounted. This power drive includes three continuously rotating shafts, namely, a shaft 63 for operating the computing mechanism and the numeral type bars, a snatch roll El for operating the alphabetic and other character type bars, and a third shaft 65 which operates the tabulating, backspacing, and carriage shifting mechanisms. These three shafts are driven counter-clockwise, Fig. 1, by any suitable means, such as a motor, as shown in patent to Dodge et al. 2,064,154, December 15, 1936. 
 Each of the alphabet type bar operating levers 56 has a hook 66 pivoted thereto and hanging down in front of the snatch roll 64. Each of the alphabet key levers 58 has a depending arm 01, 
adapted to rock a bell-crank 58 carrying a hook engaging the upper arm of the hook 66 in such fashion that, when the key lever is depressed, the 
hook 06 is swung into engagement with the snatch roll which depresses the lever 88 and operates the type bar. 
 0n the shaft 83 there is a series of cams 1|, one for each numeral key, and said cams are loose on the shaft and each is controlled by a clutch, the dog 12 of which is shown in Fig. 1, said dog adaptedfor engagement with a toothed wheel fast on the shaft. This dog is controlled by a latch 13 adapted to be tripped by a pusher 1| pivoted to the associated numeral key lever 60 with the result that the dog 12 engages the toothed wheel and drives the cam 1l for a single rotation at the end of which it is arrested by the dog, 12 again striking the latch 13. Each cam 1| controls a follower lever 1I urged downward by a strong spring 16. The shape of the cam is such that, when it rotates, this lever moves first downward and then up to its normal position. The lever 15 carries a pivoted pawl member 11, which, when the lever is at the bottom of its stroke, snaps in under the front-end of a lever 18, which at its rear end is articulated by pin and slot with one of the levers 51. On the up-stroke of the lever 15, pawl 11 rocks the lever 18, which, in turn, rocks the lever 81 and operates the numeral type bar. 
 Each-lever 15 has pivoted thereto a link 80, which is pivoted to a lever 8|, which, in turn, is pivoted to a vertical link 82, which operates the computing mechanism. All of this mechanism is so well known that it is unnecessary to describe it further. 
 The Remington machine also includes a space bar 83, whose bail arms 84 are fast on a shaft 80. an arm of which is adapted to operate the dog rocker 86 of the typewriter escapement through a link 81. This link is also arranged to be operated by a universal bar which is actuated by the heel of each of the type bars 54. The typewriter also includes a denominational tabulating mechanism. The column stop bar 88 at the rear of the typewriter carriage carries column stop 90 adapted to be arrested by denominational stops 9| mounted in a frame 92 at the rear of the typewriter. These stops 9| are operated by vertical levers 93, which, in the present machine, are or may be operated by power under control of the tabulator keys 9i at the front of the machine. The mechanism for operating most of the denominational stops is not shown herein, but lthe drawings do show the mechanism for operating one of the stops 9| automatically by the travel of the typewriter carriage. This particular stop is operated by one of the levers 03, which, like the other such levers, is operated by a slide 95, which, in turn, is operated by a vertical lever 96 pivoted in a special tabulator frame 01. This mechanism is substantially the same as that described in the patent to Dodge et al. above mentioned, and it will, therefore, be unnecessary to describe it further. Lever 96 is operated by a link 98 pivoted onv the follower lever |00 of a cam |0| which is loose on the drive shaft 65 and operated by a clutch comprising a toothed wheel fast on said shaft and engageable by a dog |02. This dog is normally held out of engagement by a compound latch |03 in the form of a three-armed lever pivoted at |04, the horizontal arm of this lever normally holding the cam in the position shown in Fig. 1. When this lever is rocked counterclockwise to release the dog |02 a tooth or hook on the end of the upright arm |05 of this lever moves into the path of the dog |02 and arrests the dog at about the end of a quarter-rotation of ascuas the' cam. so that the cam stands in that position until .the compound dog is rocked back to normal position. When'that occurs thedog is released from the latch arm |05 and is, at the end of its complete rotation, arrested in normal position by the arm |03. 4The outline of the cam Ill is such that, during the first quarter-rotation thereof, it rocks the follower lever Illtoward the rear moving the stop 9| into active position and holding it there until near the` e'nd of the complete rotation of the cam. More than half of the outline of this cam is a concentric high part so that the stop is not withdrawn instantly on therelease I of the dog arm |05, but remains in stopping position until near the end of the rotation of the cam, thus giving the carriage time to settle down from any vibration that may have been caused by its arrest. Y Y 
 'I'he latch or detent |03, |05 is operated by a plate-like lever |06, which lies beneath the rearwardly extending third arm of the latch member. 
` This lever is adapted to be rocked clockwise in order to operate said latch lever by a long rod |01 resting on its rear end and extending upward to a pointabove the top plate of the typewriter, where its upper end rests under the end of an arm |08 of a device arranged to rock on a transverse horizontal pivotal axis and comprising an upstanding-arm ||0 adapted to cooperate with a cam bar mounted on the underside of the column stop bar 08 in such manner that it can be set-at any desired location lengthwise of said bar. As this automatic tabulating mechanism is fully described in the Dodge et al. patent, and as its detailed construction forms no part of the present invention,- it is believed that no further description ofit is necessary herein. All of the tabulator levers 93 cooperate with a universal bar ||2 lying behind them and having an arm ||3 extending horizontally forward therefrom, said arm connected by a link I4 with an arm fast on a rock- `shaft ||5 in the base of the typewriter. The construction is such that, when any tabulator stop is operated, this universal bar is rocked` counter-` clockwise and rocks the shaft I l5 clockwise. This shaft has an arm |16 adapted to operate an arm ||1 fast on a second rock-shaft ||8 so as to rock the clutch mem-bers into engagement, and at the motion of the carriage, is automatically pulled downand latched down by means controlled by the carriage. This mechanism is not further described because it bears on the present invention only in the respect that it opens a pair of `contacts to break an electric circuit during the time when the carriage is being returned. 'I'hese contacts '|31 are shown in Fig. 16 as mounted respectively |40 -fastened to the rear left-hand corner post of the typewriter, and bearing against the cross stud |2| hereinbefore referred to as being swung toward the front of the machine whenever the tabulator is in operation. The shaft |35 has fast thereon a depending arm |4|, which also moves this same cross stud forward during the time when thel carriage return mechanism is in operation. In its normal position, this stud holds the contacts closed, but they spring open whenever said stud is movedtoward the front of the machine either by the tabulator or by the carriage return mechanism. 
Except 4as hereinafter described, the computing mechanism is of the sort that has long been used in the Remington machine and which is described 1n a line of patents, which in a way may be said |25; begin with that to Wahl 1,270,471, dated June including a cross truck |52 carrying a cross tothe latter counter-clockwise. Said shaft ||6 has fast thereon an arm |20, the upper end of which (Fig. 16) carries a cross piece or stud |2| .which (Fig.. 1) is connected by a pin and slot with a long link |22, which operates a certain' lock, which in the Remington machine is called the ball lock, at the front of the machine, so as to lock allnumeral keys .and certain other devices'whenever the tabulator is in operation. The typewriting machine includes a power drivencarriage return mechanism, A rack |26 is mounted on the under side of the rear rail of the carriage 5| and meshes with a pinion |21 on the upper end of a vertical shaft |20, on which a worm wheel |30 is loosely joumaled. This worm wheel is driven by a worm |3| on a shaft |32 driven by a belt at the right-hand side of the machine. 
'I'he said worm wheel |30 carries the driving element of a clutch, the driven element of which is a sleeve |33 slidably splined on the shaft |28 and controlled by an arm |34 fast on a rockshait |35, which at its left-hand end (Fig. 16) is totalizers |46, and 
controlled through an arm |36 by a mechanism l not shown herein, but which is .well known in the art. 'I'his mechanism may be so set that, at the en d of/a line of writing, the arm.|3 6 is autotalizer |53 and picked up by the vertical totalizers |46, one after another through the intermediary of a pick-up beam |54. At theend of each computing column the cross truck'is freed from the vertical totalizer and is drawn back by a spring to its initial right-hand position. 
 vThe links 82 v(Fig. 1) operate the usual "fan segments and goose-neck cams, which rock a difi'erential shaft 19 `(Fig. 2) and operate the ver.- tical master wheel |55 (Fig. 3) and a cross master wheel |56 to rotate the carrier gear wheels |51 and |58 of the vertical and cross totalizers y The transfermechanism, etc., are all of the usual kind. The vertical master whee1 is reversible for subtraction by means of the usual hand lever not shown. The cross master wheel is reversible for subtraction by cluding a follower roller |62 (Figs. 2 and 3) mounted on an arm |63 fast on a. rock-shaft |64 and operating the reversing mechanism. The follower roller |62 is under the control of cams |65 (Figs. 2 and 3), one on each of the vertical each cam is setta'ble to an upper position where it does not depress the roller |62 but leaves the cross master wheel set for addition, as in the left-hand one of the four totalizers shown in Fig. 2, or to an intermediate position as in the third totalizer shown, where is disconnects the cross master wheel leaving it inoperative, or to a lowest position shown on the the usual means in on two blades |36 and from the lower cross bar on a spring-pressed lever 181 so as second and fourth totalizers where it depresses the roller 182 to its full extent and sets the cross master wheel to subtraction. 
 Both master wheels can be reversed simultaneously each irrespective of whether it wasbefore set for addition or for subtraction, by ,the mechanism usual in this machine, and which includes (Fig. 14) a rod or bar 166 mounted in the rear of the actuator mechanism and normally occupying its left-hand position. When this rod is slid to its right-hand position, it reverses both master wheels. This can be done by means of a so-called correction key lever 161, which, when depressed, pushes upward on a link 168, which operates the left-hand arm of a bell-crank 110, whose upper arm pushes the rod 166 toward the right. The key lever 161 has at its rear end a pin that can play in a slot 111 in a vertical link 112, which can be pushed upward underthe con trol of a key 113 which is usually called a credit balance key although that term is inapt as applied to the present invention. 1n the present machine, the actual raising of this link 112 is effected by the case shift mechanism, which at the same time imparts an upward case shift movement. to the platen 53 so as to print negative numbers with a distinctive form of type. Mechanism similar to that employed in the present machine has been in use in the Remington machine heretofore, but, as this mechanism has been modied somewhat for the purposes of the present invention, it will be described in some detail. 
 The power-operated case shift mechanism (Figs. 13, 14, and includes a rail 114 on which rides a roller or wheel 115 journaled on a stud 116 of the platen frame 114 is supported and operated in 52. This fail the manner shown in Fig. '1 of the patent to Hart No. 1,929,064, dated October 3, 1933, which patent describes a power-operated case shift, but not eX actly like the one now employed. The rail 114 has several posts 111 by which it is supported, each of said posts playing in a slot in a bell-crank 11e to which the post is pivoted at 180. Each of these bell-cranks is pivoted on afstud 181 supported by the top plate of the typewriter and the downwardly extending arms of all of the bellcranks are connected by a long transverse link 182 in such a manner that by pulling this link toward the left in Fig. 18, all of the bell-cranks will be rocked clockwise and will elevate the rail i111 and the platen frame. One"I of the bellcranks 11S has pivoted thereto at 180 the upper end of a push link 183, which at its lower end is guided for vertical movement by suitable stationary guide plates. The lower end of this link is substantially directly above the power shaft near the left-hand end thereof.' Mounted loosely cn the shaft 65 is an assembly comprising a cam 1530 anda detent cam or disc 185. The latter has a concentric outline interrupted by two notches adapted to be engaged by a roller 186 mounted to retain the disc and with it the cam 184 in either their normal position shown in Fig. 14.- or in another position about removed from normal. The cam 11.36 has pivoted thereto the usual clutch dog 188 adapted for cooperation with the usual toothed wheel 190 fast on the continuously rotating shaft 65. The parts are held in the normal position shownby a latch 191 pivoted on a stationary stud 182 and drawn upward by a spring 193 in position to arrest the dog 188 and force it out of engagement with the wheel 180. A second latch 194 above the cam assembly is adapted to arrest the dogy 188 and the rotation. This of floating lever cam assembly after about a halflatch is in the form of a sort brace a stationary stud 195 on which it can slide. The latch 194 is pivoted at 196 to a coupling member 191 guided for up and down motion by a stationary stud 198 passing through a slot in the coupling member. The lower end of lhiS Coupling member is forked to embrace a stud 200 projecting from the lower latch 191 in such fashion that, if the coupling member is pushed downward bringing the upper latch 194 into the path of the dog 188, it will push the lower latch out of engagement and permit the cam to make a half-rotation. When the pressure on the coupling member is released, the parts are drawn by the spring 193 into their normal position shown, releasing the dog 188 from the latch 199 and causing it to be arrested after a half-rotation at normal position by the latch 191. The coupling member 191 isv connected with the lower latch 191 by a tension spring 201 so that, if the latch 191 is pulled downward, it tends to draw the latch 194 after it, but the spring can yield momentarily if the upper latch is held at the time. 
 The cam 184 is adapted to operate a follower roler 202 mounted on the end of an arm 203 pivoted on a stationary stud 204, said roller bear ing on the top of the cam. At the right of the arm 203 is another arm 205 (see Fig. l5) substantially parallel therewith, and also pivotedl on the stud 204. This arm 205 has a stud 20S on which the foot of the push ink 183 rests and by which said link is pushed upward to effect the shift. The arms 203 and 205 are connected by a pair of strong springs 201 one at each side of the piece 205 and each secured at its lower end to a post 208 projecting in both directions from a depending branch of the arm 205 and at its upper end to a stud 210 projecting from the arm 2113. Said stud is of such length as to project through a hole 208 in the arm 205 so as to support the two springs one on each side of 205. The hole 20S is larger than the stud 210, so that although the two arms 203 and 2115 ordinarily rook together, the former can be forced a little higher when the stops arrest the upward shift of the platen, stretching the springs 201. Except for the springi, the case shift mechanism so far described, is the same that has been in use in the Remington machine heretofore. 
 In the operation of the present invention, the case shift mechanism is brought into use when writing negative totals, by the latch 191 being drawn downward by a link 211 connected with an arm 212 of the armature 213 of an electromagnet 214 mounted on a stationary part 215. When in entering items, it is desired to reverse the normal direction of the operation of the computing mechanism and to print an item in distinctive type, a case shift mechanism is brought into operation by means of the credit balance key 113. Without reversing the computing mechanism it can be brought into operation by means of the case shift key 216 or the shift lock key 211. To these ends a lever 21B, pivoted at 220, has on its rear end an adjustable piece 221, which bears on the coupling member 191 so that a counter-clockwise rocking of the lever will depress that member and bring the case shift mechanism into operation. The lever 218 is so rocked by pin-and-slot connection 222 with the key lever 223 on which the case shift key or button 219 having a downwardly and rear- `wardly extending part forked at its end to emdepressed with or shiftlock key 2|1. 
is mounted. Said lever 223 has a restoring spring 224. 
 In the Remington machine the power driven case shift mechanism is also utilized to shift the reversing mechanism of vthe computer. To this end the usual shaft 225, which at its forward end is Journalled in a frame plate 226 and carries the arm 221 to which the link |12 is pivoted .(see also Fig. 2) has also at its forward enda small gear sector 228 meshing with another gear sector 236 on an additional shaft 23| lying parallel with the shaft 225 and, like it, journalled in frame plate 226 and in another frame plate 232. This shaft 23| has on its rear end an arm 233, which is connected by a link 234 (Fig. 13) with an arm or bracket 235 secured to the link |83 near the upper end of the latter. The construction is such that, when said link is shifted upward for upper case, it rocks the shaft 23| clockwise in Fig. 13. In Fig. 13 the plate 232 is omitted for clearness. The clockwise rotation of the shaft 23| may be imparted to the sector 230, which will rotate the shaft 225 counter-clockwise and reverse the computing mechanism. Said shaft 225 also has at its rear end an arm 236, which operates a link 231, which extends to the bi-color mechanism of the machine and sets it for printing in red. The sector 230 is loose on the shaft 23|, but is connectable with it by means of a clutch, one element of which consists of a notched hub 233 of said sector, and the drivingelement of which is a toothed sleeve 240 slidable on the shaft 23|, but constrained to rotate with it by pin-and-slot connection 24|. In the Remington machine as heretofore constructed, this sleeve 2,40 normally occupies a rear position out of engagement with the other member of the clutch so that a depression of the shift key 2|6 causes a case shift operation, but does not operate the shaft 225 and the computer reversingmechanism. A linkage is provided, however, of such a sort that, if the credit balance key |13 be depressed, the clutch member 240 will be moved into engagement, and in that event the computing mechanism will be reversed, and the bi-color mechanism set for printing red. If this construction was used in the present machine, the magnet 2id would not reverse the computer. This standard Remington construction has, therefore, been modified so as to reverse the last mentioned mode of operation, that is to say, the clutch 240 is normally in engagement and remains in engagement if the credit balance key |13 is depressed, but is drawn out of engagement if the case shift key 2|6 is without an operation of the The clutch member 240 is controlled by means including an arm 242 pivoted on a stationary pivot 243 and lying in a peripheral groove in said clutch member or sleeve 240. This arm 242 is controlled by a toggle consisting of a link 244 pivoted to the arm 242 and pivoted at its other end to a link 245, which, in turn, is pivoted on a fixed s tud 246. This toggle is normally straight or turned a shade upward beyond its dead center. but is adapted to be broken as shown in Fig. 
 by the depression of the shift key 2|6. The link 244 is preferably made of two layers by folding a long piece of sheet metal back upon itself, and the pivot 241 by which it is connected with the link 245 joins these two layers. Also stradling this pivot between said two layers is a lever 248 having a bifurcated end and a xed pivot 250, this lever extending out in front of frame plate226. The credit balance key |13 is pivoted 45 at 25| on a bracket projecting frontward from the plate 226 and it is drawn upward by a fairly strong spring 252, its motion being limited by a heel 253 of the key lever coming against said plate 226. 
 The shift lock key 2| 1 is of the same construction as heretofore used in the Remington machine. It is pivoted at 254 to the key lever 223, its motion relative to said lever being limited by a stud -255 occupying a fork in the front end of lever 2|1. Said key is held in its upper position by a spring 256. This key lever has a short arm 251 which controls a locking dog 258 pivoted to the lever 223 at 260, and this lever has a stud 26| which is drawn up against the arm 251 by a spring 262, attached to said stud and to the stud on the lever 2|'|. In the normal position of the lever 2|1., the latch 258 is held in the position shown in Fig. 14, where it'will not engage a sheet metal bracket or stop 263 projecting from the stationary framework. When, however, the lever 223 is depressed by pressure of the finger on the key 2H, the latter ls rocked about its pivot 254. as shown in Fig. 5, depressing the lever 223 and allowing the locking dog 258 to snap in under the stop 263, so that, when pressure `on the key is removed, the lever 223 will be held in its depressed position. The spring 256 tends to restore the lever 2|1, but is unable to clo so on account of the frictional resistance on the dog 258 due to the pressure of the said dog againstthe stop 263 by the superior spring 224. A tap of the finger on the key 2 6 will momentarily release this pressure and allow the key 2li' to return to its normal relation to the lever 223 and allow the latter to return to normal position. 
 In order to release the clutch member 240 from the clutch member 238 when the case shift key or shift lock key 2| 1 is depressed, a bell-crank 264 is pivoted to the' side of the credit balance key lever at 265 and its arm has a stud 26S lying beneath the front end of the lever 248. This bellcrank 264 extends down alongside of key lever 2 I 1 and it has an inclined slot embracing a stud 268 on the side of said lever 2|'|. 'I'he inclination of this slot is such that a depression of either of the keys 2 i6 or 2|'l rocks the bell-crank 264 clockwise in'Fig. 5, rocking the lever A248 counter-clockwise and breaking the toggle 244, 245 and pulling the clutch member 246 out of engagement. As shown in Fig, 5, in this operation the credit balance key remains in its upper position. By this means characters other than numerals can be printed in upper case without operating the change gear mechanism. 
 Depression of the credit balance key |13 moves the parts to the position shown in Fig. 4. In this operation bell-crank 264 acts as a push link on the stud 268 and first rocks shift lock key lever 2li about its pivot 25e and then rocks the lever 223 the same as if the shift lock key itself had been directly operated. The result is that the vlocking dog 258 comes into operation and locks the lever 223 down. In this operation the lower end of the bell-crank 264 passes over a stationary stop 210, consisting of a finger of sheet metal projecting inward from the stationary framework. When the operators finger is removed from the key |13, the spring 252 restores said key. It will be perceived that the depression of the key |13 in the manner described involves both a downward movement of the bell-crank 264 as a Whole and also a counter-clockwise rotation of it about its pivot 265. The result is that the stud 266 is moved entirely away from the lever 248 the means well known in pressed between the plate 292 and does not rock said lever. The clutch member 240, therefore, remains in engagement and when the platen frame is shifted, shaft 225 is rotated and the shift gear mechanism for the two master wheels are both reversed in the manner and by the Remington machine. 
 The cross totalzer |53 is provided with an extra shaft 215 having journalled thereon a set of thirty-toothed wheels 218, one meshing with each of the carrier wheels |58, as best shown in Fig. 6. Each. of the gears 218 has riveted thereto a spacer 211 and a disc 218. Each disc 218 has three teeth 280 projecting therefrom and capable of being sensed so as to read the indication of the Wheel. The totalizer has one carrier wheel at its extreme left-hand side not connected with a dial, but provided with a special disc 28| shown in Fig. '1, and which will be more particularly described presently. 'Iwo special plates with sensing teeth will be described in the proper place. 
 The sensing unit for reading the cross-totalizer has a framework comprising a left-hand frame plate 282 mounted on two frame rods 283 and 284 of the machine. A piece of insulating material 285 is in the shape of an arch or segment of a cylinder, whose end is secured to plate 282 by screws. The right-hand end of this arch is supported by a frame member 288 (Figs. 3 and ll) also secured to the rods 283 and 284, 
 The means for sensing the digital positions of the totalizex` wheels consists essentially of a series of ten sensing fingers 281 adapted to make electrical contact with the teeth 280. These fingers have their ends projecting into the path's of movement of the teeth 280 as the latter travel with the carriage. They are arranged in an arc about the shaft 215 and are spaced 12 apart in said arc, the same as the teeth of the wheels 218, and they are so situated that when in the leftward travel of the carriage a particular carrier wheel |58 is in mesh with the master wheel |58, one of the teeth 280 of its meshing wheel 218 is in contact `with a ilnger 281 as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 12, 
 Each finger 281 (Fig. 12) is pivoted at 288 to a support 290 which is itself pivoted at 29| to a fixed but adjustable plate 292, secured to a post 293 which passes through and is supported by the arched insulator 285. A spring 294 is comthe finger 281 tending to rock said finger clockwise about its pivot 288, such rocking being limited by a pin 295 on the support 29|).y The construction is such that the finger has a fixed rest position relative to the support 290 from which it is free to swing leftward but not rightward. The pressure of the spring 294 tends to rock the support 290 counter-clockwise, its motion in that direction being limited by a stop pin 298. This support, therefore, has a definite rest position from which it is free to swing clockwise only, the finger 281 swinging with it. The right-hand end edge of the tooth 280 and the left-hand end edge of the finger 281 are beveled so that, when the tooth is traveling with the carriage toward the right it cams the finger out of its path- As the finger 281 cannot swing rightward about its own pivot, the support 290 swings clockwise. The radius from its pivoted center 29| to the end of the finger makes an acute angle with the line of travel-of the tooth, so that the finger is swung out of the path of the tooth and snaps in behind it after a relatively short travel of the carriage, as will be apparent from Fig. l2. On the other hand, the radius on which the finger swings to and a branch of r the left about its pivot 288, as the carriage steps leftward, makes normally nearly a right angle to the line of carriage travel, so that the tooth is in contact with the finger through a materially greater extent of the travel of the former, before it moves out of itspath and snaps back. In Fig. l2 a tooth 280 is shown by solid lines one step to the right of its active position. It will be seen that the tooth when stepping leftward to its active position shown in dotted lines makes contact a little before it reaches its rest position and does not lose contact until it has moved a considerable part of its next succeeding step also shown in dotted lines. This is important, because the escapement and the tabulator stops which arrest the carriage are at the rear thereof and the totalizer-at the front, and when the carriage is arrested there is a certain amount of overthrow of the totalizer, which vibrates right and left for a moment and to some extent, and this must not cause the tooth to lose contact with the finger. The present construction has proven highly successful in this regard. 
 The post 293 passes through a threaded sleeve 291 having a washer 298 and a nut 300, a conductor wire 304 being soldered to the former. The sleeve has a square head seated in an internal angular groove in the insulator 285 to prevent the sleeve from turning. Said sleeve is cross slotted at 30| (Fig. 6) so that, when the post 293 is adjusted in and out of its correct position and the nut is tightened, the V threads clamp the slotted sleeve against the post and retain it in adjusted position. Each plate 292 is seated in a slot in a short post 302 seated in the insulator, so as to prevent said plate from swinging and permitting of the described in and out adjustment. Each plate 292 may have a sheet 303 of insulation fastened to one face thereof to avoid any danger of contact between adjacent plates. It will be seen that 'all of the fingers 281 are insulated from the frame of the machine and from one another, so that a circuit may be established from a tooth 280 to one of the wires 304. All of the wires 304 and some others presently to be described, are collected into a cable 308 (Fig. 2). 
 As shown in Fig. l2, the normal position of a finger 281 is just to the right of the rest position of a tooth 280, so that said ilngers do not interfere with the rotation of the totalizer wheel. When in a. total-writing operation a tooth 28| makes contact with a finger as shown in dotted lines, a circuit is closed which causes the register wheel to -be turned to zero. In this rotation the` tooth moves out of contact with the linger which immediately snaps to its normal position shown in full lines, where it is out of the way. This whole structure may be shielded by a cover plate 305. 
 In order to detect the arrival at the .master wheel of the totalizer wheel which at the time registers the last digit other than zero, the following mechanism is provided (Figs. 2, 3, 8, and l2). Just'at the right of the row of sensing fingers 281 there is mounted a metallic archshaped detector- 308. This detector is mounted on an arm or lever 301 which is pivoted at 308 to a block 3|0 secured by screws 3I| to the insulating arch 285, so that the detector can swing about its pivot toward and from the wheels 218. One of the screws 3H has a washer 3|2 to which is connected a conductor wire 3|3. The inward motion of the detector is limited by an adjusting screw 3|4 at the lower end of the lever 301, said screw being adapted to strike a block or finger 3|5 of metal, which is secured to the insulator 285 by a screw 3|6 having a washer 3|1 to which is fastened a conductor wire 3|8. In order to secure the proper adjustment to the detector 306, said detector is pvoted at 320 to the arm 301 and two adjusting screws 32| on opposite sides of the pivot enable the detector to be adjusted about the pivot 320 and held firmly in adjusted position. In use the whole swinging member is one rigid structure pivoted at 308. Access to it is afforded by a cutout in the insulator 285 as shown in Fig. 2. 
 As best shown in Fig. 12, the right hand edge of the detector is beveled at 322 so that the teeth 280 may cam the detector outward during the travel of the carriage toward the left. The bevel on the teeth themselves will cam it outward during the rightward travel. The detector is driven toward the totalizer wheels by a light spring 326. 
 The arc covered by the detector is of an extent equal to nine tooth spaces of the wheel 216 and it is so positioned that, if a wheel stands at zero, one of its teeth 280 will be just above the upper edge and another of itsteeth just below the lower edge of the detector, as shown in Fig. 8, so that a wheel standing in this position will not hold the detector in its outer position. If, however, any wheel registers a digit other than zero. one of its teeth 280 engages the detector and holds it a short distance away from the wheel, as shown in Fig. 3. The contact screw 3|4 is so adjusted-that, when there is no wheel behind the detector registering a digit other than zero, then the detector will swing inward until the screw 3|4 touches and is arrested by the block 3|5, and will thereby make electrical contact between the wires 3|3 and 318; but a vwheel in any other position will hold the detector outward and prevent the screw 3|4 coming in contact with the wire 3|5. The left-hand edge of this detector (Fig. 12) is at such a distance to the right of the lingers 281 that, when a totalizer wheel is in engagement with the master wheel and its tooth 280 is in contact with one of the fingers 281, the next wheel to the right of it will still be behind the detector. When the last wheel that registers a digit other than zero moves into engagement with the master wheel, therefore. the detector will be freed and its spring 326 will close the contact 3|43| 5. The detector 306 is at least long enough toward the right so that, when the highest totalizer wheel is in engagement with the master wheel. the lowest wheel will be behind the detector. 
 In order to determine at the very beginning of a total-writing operation whether the balance registered on the totalizer is positive or negative. the left-hand wheel 216 has its disc 28| made in the form shown in Fig. 7. It differs from the disc 218 in that instead of having three teeth 280, it has-fifteen teeth 2800, one at every other toothspace. This wheel is never turned except by a transfer from the highest totalizer wheel provided witha dial. This left-hand wheel. therefore, in correct operation never registers any digits except zero and nine. the former when the total is positive, and the latter when it is negative. One tooth 280 would suiice to detect this difference, but it is considered preferable to putin a full set of them partly to simplify the assembling of the machine, but mainly because. throughV some unusual operation, the wheel may become accidentally rotated, as for example, by a great over-running of the capacity of the totalizer. Any even .numbered position of this wheel will indicate 'a positive total, and any odd num-k 7 bered position a negative total, with the understanding that in normal operation, this amounts to a zero indication or a nine indication. In order to sense this special wheel, a special sensing finger 280| (Figs. 6 and 7) is set three toothspaces above the zero sensing finger 280. It is mounted like the other sensing fingers on a post 293|. except that this post and the sensing finger itself are situated one letter-space distance to the left of the plane of the other sensing fingers, as` indicated by the position of this post 293| in Fig. 2. The result is that, when the carriage is tabulated to the highest wheel for'which the totalizer is adapted, that is to say, to the second wheel from the left, the finger 280| comes into action at the same time as one of the fingers 280. This special sensing finger is connected with a wire 328 (Fig. 6), the electrical connections from which will be described hereinafter. 
 Remington totalizers are sometimes spaced for punctuation by commas, one such space being shown in Fig. 1l. When this position of the totalizer reaches the master wheel, the carriage is automatically letter-spaced under the control of a built-up disc 330, thev outline of which is shown in Fig. 9. This plate has a hub occupying one letter-space position on the shaft 215, and an arm or branch extending upward and forked to embrace the shaft 33| on which the idler pinions |60 are journalled, this arrangement being to prevent rotation of the disc. 'This disc has a tooth 332 (Fig. 6) one tooth space above the zero position of a wheel 216. This tooth 332 is longer than the teeth 280 and it cooperates with a sensing finger 333 similar to the sensing fingers 281, but shorter so that it will not be affected by one of the teeth 280. This sensing finger 333 is mounted on a post 334 connected to a wire 335, whose electrical connections will be described hereinafter. 
 The totalizer also has a blank space for the decimal point and this is occupied by a plate 336, whose outline is shown in Fig. 10. It is like the plate 330 except that its tooth 331 occupies a. position one tooth-space behind the nine position of the wheel. This tooth 331, like the tooth 332, is longer than the teeth 280 and it is engaged by a fore-shortened sensing finger 338 (Fig. 6) secured to a post 340 and connected to a wire 34| whose electrical connections will be described hereinafter. 'Ihe said connections not only cause a letter-space step of the carriage, but also perform another function which will be described; 
 The automatic spacing of the carriage is effected by a solenoid 342 (Figs. 19, 20, and 21) mounted on a bracket 343 secured to the frame or casing 92 for the tabulator stops. This solenoid has its plunger 344 in position to push forward an arm 345 secured to the rear surface of the dog-rocker 86. The momentary reciprocation of this plunger will operate the dog-rocker the same as the ordinary link 81. 
 In order to control the electric circuit by the typewriter carriage in a manner to be explained hereinafter, the following devices are provided (Figs. l, 2, 19, 20, and 22). The bracket 343 projects some distance rearward and includes a leftward projecting branch to which is secured a group of contact springs separated by insulating material in the usual way, and comprising two pairs of contacts 346 and 341, the latter in front of the former. The Remington machine as sometimes `manufactured includes a long transverse bar 348 mounted on the typewriter carriage by arms 350 at its ends. The bar is utilized to support one or more adjustable cam blocks 35| which may be adjustably secured to the bar in am' suitable way. As here shown each said block is secured to a loop 352 partially surrounding the bar 348 so that it can be slid lengthwise of the bar to any suitable position, where it can be secured by a set screw 353. This block is on the forward face of the bar 348 and its left-hand end is inclined as shown so as, in the leftward travel of the carriage, to cam forward a roller 354 mounted on the upper end of a; spring-leaf 355 secured to the bracket 343 along with the other spring-blades and insulated from the contact springs. As the carriage travels toward the left, the block 35| will cam the roher 354 toward the front of the machine, first closing the contacts 346 and then closing the contacts 341. This block is so adjusted on the bar 348 as to close these contacts in that step of the carriage in which the highest significant wheel of the cross totalizer is brought into engagement with the cross master wheel in the total or balance column. As will hereinafter appear, the result is that the electric circuit for the automatic writing of a total is closed or energized at that instant. 
The high part o! the cam block 35| is of such length as to keep the contacts closed during the whole travel of the wheels of the cross totallzer over the master wheel. After writing the last digit of the total, the' carriage steps as usual to the sub-units position. At the right-hand end f the block 35| there is a step 355 lower than the high part of the block so that in the sub-units position,l the roller 354 occupies a mid-position between its normal position, where the ycontacts are open and its forward position where the contacts are closed. In this sub-units position the roller holds the contacts 346 closed but leaves the contacts 341 open. As will be explained this is in order to break the circuit to the numeral printing solenoids without breaking that of the solenoid for writing a clear signal. 
 When it is desired to write a running or read total (without clearing the total'izer) another cam block 348 like the block 35| may be mountedvon the bar 348 to the left of said block 35|. A second bar 351 is mounted behind the bar 348 and carries a short contact block 352 which, in the sub-units position of the column deilned by block 346, deilects another follower roller 358. This controls two pairs of contacts 356 and 36|, the former normally closed and the latter normally open. This is to control the printing of a certain special symbol as will be explained. 
 In Fig. 20 the parts are shown diagrammatically in a position between the sub-total and clearing total positions of the carriage. The arm I6 is shown deflected rearward by the cam block and the carriage is, therefore, running free under control of the automatic tabulator. 
 The clear signal mechanism includes the usual comb feeler 363 resting on the teeth of the dial pinions and, when the last totalizer wheel comes to zero position, they are permitted by the aligned fore-shortened pinion teeth 365 to assume the position shown in Fig. 6, under the pressure of a spring 31| acting through the articulated arms 366 and 361. When any pinion is turned vto a position other than zero, its full-length teeth swing the feeler clockwise and the bell-crank 351, 316 counter-clockwise, moving the projecting finger 316 from its clear-signifying position shown in full lines to its non-clear position indicated by dotted lines. When, the totalizer being cleared, it jumps back to the right at the end of a. 
column, ringer 816 runs under and lifts the usual cam 312 (Fig. 18) which is secured as usual to a lever arm 313 pivoted at 314 to a frame plate 315 and acted on by a spring 316. When the totalizer is not clear, the nger 316 does not touch 312. In the present machine, the finger 316 and cam 312 constitute the contacts to close a clear signprintlng circuit, and the plate 315 is, therefore, insulated by sheets, washers and sleeves 386 of insulating material separating the plate 315 from the casting |45 and from the securing screws 318. A wire 38| is secured to said plate and forms part of the circuit. 
' The Remington machine includes a disconnect key 382 consisting of a lever pivoted on a frame bracket and projecting from the front of the machine. This lever may be depressed by hand with the effect that the links 82 (Fig. l) become ineiective to actuate the computing mechanism. With this key in its depressed position where it can be latched by a small lever 383, the machine becomes a mere typewriter and the register wheels do not turn. It is customary in the Remington machine to use a star key lock as a part of the clear signal mechanism, and it is customary to provide means whereby this lock cannot be released when the disconnect key is depressed. Mechanism for this purpose, well-known in the machine, includes the following parts: 
 In Fig. 18, 384 designates several of the vertical frame bars constituting parts o f the framing of the actuator. Between two of these there is mounted-a frame bar 385, having pivoted thereto at 886 a perculiarly shaped lever 381 controlled by a spring 388 tending to rock it clockwise. Disconnect key 382 rocks a lever 38.6 whose principal function is to throw out of action certain fullstroke devices, said lever being pivoted on a frame post 38|. It has a rearwardly extending arm overlying a leftward extending arm of the lever 381 sothat when the key is depressed the last named lever is rocked counter-clockwise drawing leftward a link 382 to vwhich is secured a plate 383 sliding in one of the frame plates 384. This existing mechanism is utilized in the present machine to close an electric circuit whose purpose is to disable the automatic clear-sign printing mechanism. To this end a stationary bar or arm 384 (Figs. 1'1 and 18), is secured to a stationary plate 315 by means of screws 385. A sheet of insulating material and suitable washers and sleeves of the same material 388 insulate this bar 384 from the bracket 315. At its left-hand end at 381 this bar has pivoted thereto a depending lever 388 arranged to be rocked by a spring 46| attached to the bar 384, counter-clockwise, pressing said lever against a sleeve 462 of insulating material surrounding the screw 463 by which the plate 383 is secured to the wire link 382. When said link is drawn leftward by the depression of the disconnect key 382, it rocks the lever 388 clockwise, moving a contact spring 484 mounted thereon into contact with the head of a bolt 465 which is secured to the bar 384 through insulation 465. This bolt has a wire 461 connected thereto and another wire 468 is connected to the bar 384. The construction is such that when .the disconnect key is down electric connection is made between these 468. It will, of course, be understood that the details just described have been used merely to adapt this electrical contact to the mechanism already in the machine. Any suitable contacts may be employed to close a circuit when the disconnect key is depressed. 
two wires 461 and
