A TTORNEY Patentcdfiee. m, 1944 Harold T. Avery, Oakland, Gail? assignor to Merchant Calculating Machine Company, a corporation of California Application June 11, 1938, Serial No. 213,195 
26 Claims. 
 The present invention relates to calculating machines of the type adapted to perform the four cardinal calculations and combinations thereof, and particularly to the type "in which the actuators are mounted in the frame of the machine and a register is mounted in a carriage, transversely shiftable on said frame. 
 This invention is disclosed as embodied in a machine. of the .type shown in the Avery Patent Number 2,271,240 issued January 27, 1942, on application, Serial Number 84,927, filed June 12, 1936, to which reference is hereby made for a disclosure of the complete calculating machine, including mechanisms not specifically disclosed herein. It is to he understood, however, that although the invention is shown applied to a machine in which the carriage is shifted and the actuators are stationary, it is applicable to any calculating machine in which the carriage is stationary and the actuators are shifted,or one in which the carriage and actuators are station any and devices connecting the actuators and the register are shifted. 
 In a calculating machine of the general type disclosed in the aforesaid patent, a power transmission mechanism is provided, whereby the shiftable carriage may be traversed laterally by power derived from the motor. Control of this carriage shifting is effected by clutch means forming a part of such mechanism, and a key, or preferably two keys, are provided, whereby the clutch means may be rendered effective to cause the carriage to be shifted in one, or selectively in the other direction. in related types of ma chines the actuators may be shifted with respect to a fixed register, or devices connecting a fixed register fixed actuators may be shifted by similar power transmission mechanisms. 
 When a carriage shift control key is depressed by the operator of such a machine the carriage is thus moved, in the selected direction, in to the desired operating position. The clutch means mined by the release of a shift key at the correct time; therefore, it is necessary for the operator to hold his attenticntothe operation of the machine until it has been stopped. 
In the same type of machine, however, with l the present invention incorporated, the desired functioning in this operation operate cyclically carriage. position is selected, and a shift of the carriage thereto initiated by the depression of one of a plurality of tahulator selection keys. Alternatively, by the partial depression of one of said keys, the operator may predeter'mine the position to which the carriage wili be shifted upon subsequent depression of a master tahulator key. In a machine embodying this invention the tah-ulator key selected is latched downand the carriage shifting mechanism is automatically arrested when the carriage reaches its selected position, thereby making it unnecessary for the operator tohold his attentionto the operation of the machine. 
It is an object of the invention to provide improved antcmatic means, in. machines of this position by a single manual stroke oi selected one of series oi tahnlator izeys. 
 A further object to provide means a series oi tahulator selection. keys may nativeiy employed, either to initiate antomatte positioning oi the carriage to a 1 position, or to predetermine the position to v, 
the carriage will he shifted upon depression of the master talouiator key. 
 A further object is to provide controls for the automatic carriage positioning mechanism, including a series of selectively operable keys so arranged that complete depression of any oi them will both select the positionto which the carriage is to betraversed and initiate' the automatic traversing; while the latching of any of said keys in a partially depressed positionwill determine the position to which the carriage will be automatically traversed upon subsequentdepression of a master tabulator key. 
 A further object is to provide means for automatically bringing the carriage to a selected position in combination with keys for stepping the carriage one or more steps in either direction from the selected position. 
 A further object is to provide means for traversing the carriage in combination with means for automatically arresting its movement at either of its extreme end positions. 
 A further object is to provide an easily operating trigger means for initiating automatic carriage positioning in combination with means for automatically disabling the trigger when the carriage is in the selected position. 
 Other objects will appear during the following detailed description of a preferred form of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification, in which:

Carriage shifting mechanism The controlling mechanism embodying the present invention to be hereinafter describedis designed to control carriage shifting mechanism of the type used in the commercially known Marchant calculating machines. It is, therefore, desirable to give a brief description of the operation of this carriage shifting mechanism before an explanation of the novel controls therefor. 
 An electric motor (not shown) is connected through suitable gears and shafts to gear 382 (Figure 13) to drive the shift clutch, said gear being rotatably mounted on shaft I300 which is positionedbetween the center and right side frames of the machine described in the above mentioned Avery patent. Gear 048, used to drive unrelated mechanisms, is also rotatably mounted on shaft I306 by a flanged sleeve I30! which is keyed to the hub of gear 362 and secured by rivets to gear 048, the same rivets affixing a dished ring gear supporting disc I309 to the said gear 643. 
 The shift clutch comprises an internal ring gear ISIS secured to the supporting disc I303 and in mesh with three planetary gears I3Il (Figures 13 and 14) riveted to each of three shafts I3I'I, respectively, which extend through clearance holes provided in a ratchet wheel I303 and have end bearings in plates I3I3 and I3; said plates and said ratchet wheel being secured together as a rigid unit by studs I 3030. The gears I3 I 0 mesh also with a sun gear I320 formed upon one end of a sleeve I32 I, to the opposite end of which is keyed a second ratchet wheel I335. Gear teeth I322 formed on the shafts I3ll mesh with a second sun gear I321 to which is secured gear I 324 by which power is transmitted from the shift clutch to the shift drive train. 
 This shift clutch may be operated to transmit power to the shift drive train selectively rotating the same in either direction. Gear 302 is always rotated when the motor is running, thereby driving gear 640 and ring gear I3Il so that planetary gears I3I0 and their associated gears I322 normally revolve idly about sun Bear I321. If the ratchet wheel I303 is held, however, as when dog I302 (Figure 14) is rocked into engagement therewith, revolution of the planetary gears III. and gear I322 about sun gear I323 and I321 is prevented and said planetary gears function as idlers to transmit the drive to the sun gear I32! and its associated gear I324. If, however, the other angle bracket I343. 
ratchet wheel I305 is held by the dog I304 (Figlife 14), being rocked into engagement therewith, sun gear I320 (Figure 13) will be held stationary and the planetary gears I3I0 and gear I322 will all rotate about their own centers and revolve about sun gear I320, thereby driving the gear I324 in the opposite direction. Furthermore, if the clutch control dog I30I is in its neutral position, shown in Figure 14, wherein neither dog I302 nor I304 is engaged, the differential merely idles and there is no drive to the shifting mechanism. 
 The direction of rotation of the gear I324 determines the direction of the shift of the carriage. The gear I328 meshing with gear I324 is rotatably mounted on shaft I33I (Figure 13) between friction discs I330 and I332 keyed to said shaft. A sleeve I333 also is mounted on shaft I33I and supports a cam I334 thereon while a disc I335 is keyed to the shaft I33I. A disc I302 on which are two rollers, I363, used to function with centralizer I354, is also keyed t the shaft I33I and spring I331 is compressed between washer I333 and lock nuts I 339 on the threaded end of said shaft. This construction provides for a friction drive connection between gear I320 and shaft I33I effected by the discs I330 and I332, which are pressed against the gear I320 by spring I331 bearing against the washer I338, the roller and plate assembly I352. the spacer I333, and the disc I335. 
 The shaft I33I is supported in a suitable hearing I340 securely mounted in a frame of the machine and a second bearing I344 riveted on an A cam I345 is keyed to the end of shaft I33I and a bevel gear I34I is fixed on the same shaft to mesh with a second beve gear I342 securely mounted on.the lower end of vertical shaft 334, also supported in the adjustable angle bracket I343 secured to the base plate of the machine. 
 The aforesaid shaft 334 is supported at its upper end by bracket 358 secured to the back frame plate of the machine,' and also has fixed thereto a hub and plate assembly 350 on which are mounted rollers 351, adapted to engage between the teeth of rack 355 mounted on the shiftable carriage 350 (Figure 16), and thus, upon rotation of the assembly 355 by shaft 334, serves to drive the carriage laterally to the right or to the left. 
 The carriage may be released for free traverse by rocking rack 355 (Figure 16) about shaft 34I upwardly out of engagement with rollers 351. This rack may be rocked about its shaft 34I by means of arm 335 which extends through the cover of the carriage and carries a handle 330. 
Said arm is normally pulled against a stop 338 by spring 331 so that upon depression of said lever the spring is tensioned, and the rack 355 is rocked in a clockwise direction out of engagement with roller 351. 
 In this manner the carriage can be freed and moved to any desired lateral position, but if the operator should stop the carriage out of an operating position the teeth of the rack will not be aligned with the rollers 351 and when the handle 335 is released the rack 355 will rest on top of the rollers 351, where it will remain until the shaft 334 is rotated in an attempt to shift the carriage. When this takes place, however, one of the rollers 351 during the first shift cycle will become aligned with a tooth space-thereby allowing the rack to be forced downwardly into engagement with one of the rollers by spring'331. and during the ensuing shift cycles will be traversed thereby to a selected position in the regular way. 
Gil 
Carriage shift controlling mechanism Means are provided to alternatively rock either dog I302 or I304 (Figure 14) into engagement with clutch ratchet I303 or I305, respective y, to effect a rightward or leftward carriage shift. Said means comprises a lever I480 fixed on shaft I485 and having at its upper end, two facing lugs I430, and a lever I481. also provided with two identical facing lugs I400. The lever I48I, however, is freely rockable on shaft I485 adjacent lever I480, and a spring I430 is compressed between the four coincidental lugs I486, thereby, 
forming a yieldable connection between levers I480 .and MM, by means of which lever I480, integral with shaft I485, can transmit its motion to lever I40I only through spring I480. If lever I40I is restrained when shaft I485 and lever I480 are rocked, the spring I490 will merely be further compressed and no damage to the parts will result from such restraint. 
 The lower end of lever I48I is attached to the left end of link I483 so that the rocking of lever I48I imparts longitudinal movement to link I483, said link being provided with a notch I414 on the right end thereof to embrace a lateral extension I41I formed on the lower end of lever I315, whereby longitudinal movement of link I483 will effect rocking movement of lever I315 about its supporting shaft I318. The upper end of lever I315 is attached to a link I314 SO that the rocking 1 of lever I315 imparts longitudinal movement to link I314 which has at its rear end an aperture in which are two facing lugs I5I0. Adjacent the rear end thereof, is another link I5II with an identical aperture, also with two facing lugs I5I0. Links I314 and I5II are yieldably connected by compression spring I5I2 located over the four lugs Link I5II is pivotally connected at its forward end to the shift clutch control dog I30I by stud I5I3, so that longitudinal movement of link I314 will cause the clutch control dog to rock about shaft I299. As previously described under the sub-heading Carriage shifting mechanism, control dog I30I constitu s the controlling means for the shift clutch I300, and the direction of the rocking of control dog I30I determine the direction of the shift b its engagement with ratchet Wheel I303 or I305. 
 Two levers are fixed to shaft I485 from which control of said shaft is derived, one being the tabulator operating lever 250 (Figure 14), the function of which will be described hereinafter in connection with the "Tabulator initiating mechanism, and lever I482 (Figure 14A), which is actuated by the shift keys I405 and I406 to directly effect shifting of the carriage in either direction. 
 As shown in Figure 14A, these keys are mounted on the usual vertically sliding stems, which are connected by links I401 and I403, pivotally connected at pin 1409. Spring I4I0 tensioned between one of said links and the machine frame. normally retains both keys in raised .position, but upon depression of one of the keys the pin I408 is moved either to the right or to the left. according to the key selected, being guided in such movements by a fixed member I4|1 which also serves to prevent simultaneous depression of the keys. The pin. I409 is embraced by the bifurcated upper end of lever I482, mentioned above as one of the two levers fixed to shaft I485. Therefore, it will be seen that upon depression of the shift key I405 the pin I409 is moved to the right, rocking lever I482 and shaft I485 clockwise to engage dog I302 with ratchet wheel I303 and effect a rightward carriage shift, while upon depression of shift key I406 the pin I409 is moved to the left, rocking the lever I482 and shaft I485 counter-clockwise to engage dog I304 with ratchet I305 and effect a carriage shift to the left, in a manner described hereinbefore. 
 Means are provided whereb the dogs I302 and I304 are held in engagement with their respective ratchet wheels during approximately the first three quarters of the shift cycle, to insure the completion of any initiated shift no matter how quickly the key is released; On a leftward extension of the clutch control dog I30i (Figure 14) is a formed ear I354 engaging the projection I353 of the latch I350, said latch being pivotally mounted at I35I and urged into engagement with said ear by spring I352. When control dog I301 is moved, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, the ear I354 is held by latch I350 which rocks about shaft I35I under the tension of spring I352 and seats its projection I353 either above or below ear I354, thus latching the clutch control dog I30I against return movement. 
 Provision is made for additionally tensioning spring I352 at the beginning of the shift cycle, and for this purpose centralizer I364 is utilized, the upper end of spring I352 being attached to the extreme left end thereof. clutch I300 first begins to rotate, rollers I363, mounted on disc I362, revolve about shaft I33I and in their movement, one of said rollers cams the centralizer I364 upwardly, thereby exerting mor and more tension on spring I352 until the shaft i33i has made one-quarter of a rotation. 
 Provision is made for moving latch I350 (Figure 14) to release ear I354 at about three-quarter cycle position. It will be seen that the cam I334, utilized for this purpose, includes two opposite rises over which a nose I351 of latch I350 rides. Upon counter-clockwise rotation of the cam from the position shown in Figure 14, the nose I351 rides over one of these at the end of about threequarters of its cycle, To secure the same cyclic time of operation of latch I350 for the reverse rotation of shaft I33I, the cam I334 is free on shaft I33I and is driven by the disc I335 keyed to said shaft, the disc being provided with two shoulders I360 on opposite sides thereof so that upon clockwise rotation of disc I335 from the position shown in Figure 14, pin i335 on the cam I334 is engaged by the shoulder 360 on the opposite side, only after the disc has rotated about three-eighths of a rotation (which is three-quarters of its cycle), and the rocking of latch I350 and disengagement of ear I354 occurs at the correct cyclic time. 
 When the latch I350 is thus released, th clutch control dog IBM is automatically centralized to remove the effective dog I302 or I304 from engagement with its ratchet. For this purpose centralizer I403 is pivotally mounted in the machine frame at I404, provided with a lug I403a extending laterally into engagement with lever I315 above the pivot I318, and an adjustable lug I4I'I having an offset I4I6 engaging the lever I315 below said pivot and pressed against the lever I315 by a spring I400 tensioned between a lateral extension I402 and a stud I40I in the machine frame. Thus, th centralizer I403 tends to maintain the'lever I315 in a neutral position in which the clutch dog I30I will be ineffective,.and will return it to said neutral position automatically upon release oflatch i 350, provided the operating keys I405 and I406 are released. 
When the shift Although the drive to the carriage through the shift clutch is thus terminated at approximately three-quarter cycle position, the shift drive train will be rotated through the remainder of its cycle, consisting of one-quarter rotation of shaft Illl, by the centralizer I384, pressed by spring I252 against rollers I363 on disc I382 secured to said shaft. In addition to completing the shift cycle, the centralizer I364 and I rollers I363 also serve to restrain any movements beyond the end 01' the cycle so that the carriage will always come to rest in an operating position. 
Tabuldtor setting mechanism The machine shown in Figure l is one in which the carriage may be moved to eight difl'erent operating positions and it therefore has eight tabulator selection keys 200, but could have more or less, depending upon the capacity of the machine, and it is to be understood that the mechanism controlled by each of the tabulator selection keys is duplicated in all orders of the machine, but that only one order will be described in detail. 
 The tabulator selection keys 200 have two primary functions; first, to position the tabulator controlling-mechanism for a shift in the correct direction; and, second, to initiate a shift. 
 The means provided to condition the tabulating selection mechanism are operable by anyoneof the tabulator selection keys 200 consisting of two functionally integral rportion which are preferably made separate for convenience in manufacture and assembly. The upper portion of each key 200 (Figure 2) consists of a stem 2I'II which is slidably mounted preferably in the same key frame IOI provided to support the numeral keys I00. The bottom of each stem 20I is positioned to operate against the top of a lower portion of the respective key 200 which consists of a stem 202, which is slidably mounted in the tabulator key frame 208, securely held in a lateral position in the machine by two brackets 203 attached to the front frame plate of the machine. 
 Each key 200 is normally held in a raised position by compression spring 204, compressed between the frame 208 and an ear 2I2 of stem 202. On the lower end of each stem 202 is a notch adapted to embrace the lateral extension 2 I I of a lever 2I5, rockably mounted on shaft 236, so that downward movement of the stem 202 will impart counter-clockwise movement to lever 2I5 about shaft 236. A roller 2I6 is riveted On the rearwardly extending arm of lever H5 and is adapted to impinge one or the other of the divergent sides 28I of the tabulator control lever 280 and cam it to the position shown in Figure 2. The mechanism shown in this figure is that of an order in which the key 200 has been depressed and all parts ar in the position they assume when the carriage has come to rest in its tabulated position. 
 Means are provided to latch the stem 202 in a partially depressed position so that the key 200 of which it is a part will remain depressed until the latch is released by the depression of another one of the serie of tabulator selection keys 200. The lugs 209 (Figure 3), on the lower end of the stems 202, are provided with a curved surface at the bottom,adapted to cam the lock bar 2I3 to the right, against a compression spring (not shown) during the downward movement of a stem 202 until its lug 209 passes beneath the lock bar 2I3, and thus allows said lock bar to spring back to a position overlying the top of the lug 209, thereby holding the stem in a partially depressed position, until another key 200 is depressed and its corresponding lug 209 again cams the lock bar to the :ght, thus allowing the key first depressed to be raised by spring 204 (Figure 2), and the second key to remain down du to latching its stem 202 in the same manner as the first. 
 Pendulum type interlocks 205 (Figure 3) are provided to prevent the simultaneous depression oi. two or more keys, and are attached to the tabulator key frame 208 by the shoulder studs 206 so that said interlocks are free to rock about their respective studs. The stems 202 are provided with arms 212 (Figure 2) to operate. against the shoulders 201 of the interlocks 205. As shown in Figure 3, a stem 202 has been depressed and the ear 212 of said stem in passing downwardly between the two adjacent interlocks 205 has forced the interlock to the right thereof to rock counterclockwise about the stud 205, and similarly has forced the interlock to the left thereof in a clockwise direction. In these movements of the interlocks, the opposit shoulder 201 abuts the adjacent shoulder of the next interlock 205, and so on, until all interlocks to the left of the depressed stem 202 have been rocked clockwise and all Tabulator controlling mechanism An indication of the desired position of the carriage having been set into the tabulator control mechanism by the depression of one of the keys 200, it is also necessary to set into said mechanism an indication of the present position of the carriage, and for this latter purpose a tabulator controller movable in time with the lateral shifting movement of the carriage is provided. Tabulator controller 210 (Figures 2 and is riveted, or otherwise secured, to two rearwardly extending, arms 21I oi the bail 213. Said bail is mounted on, and is free to move rockably and transversely on the worm shaft 216, and between the flanges of the bail 218, from whicharms 211 are extended, is a bushing 213 and a nut 212 which engages the groove of the worm shaft 215. On one end oi the nut 212 (Figure 10) is a flange 203, having a bifurcation 214 formed on one side thereof, adapted to embrace an angle plate 210 (Figure 2), secured to key frame 208, thereby preventing rotation of the nut 212 with the shaft 215 and causing rotation of said shaft to effect transverse movement of the nut 212, the bail 219, and the controller 210. 
 Means are provided whereby movement of the carriage will drive the wormshait 215 (Figures 10 and 16) at such a rate as will impart a lateral movement to the controller 210 proportionate to the movement of the carriage, but in the opposite direction; this opposite directional drive being necessary only because the number one tabulator selection key 200 is preferably situated at the extreme right side of the keyboard while the numher one position of the carriage is at the extreme left. For this purpose a driving rack 333 (Figures 15 and 16) is attached to the carriage 350 and has downwardly protruding teeth adapted to engage a spur gear 332 fixed to the upper end of a shaft 330, Two brackets Ill and 321, secured to the machine frame, support the upper and lower ends of shaft 330, respectively, bracket 33! having a bearing fixed thereto, while the bracket 321 supports an adjustable thrust bearing 323, in which the lower end of the shaft 330 is journal-ed while a nut 323 permits adjustment of said thrust bearing to insure the correct clearance between a bevel gear 326 secured to the lower end of shaft 330 and a second bevel gear 325 fixed to the left end of worm shaft 215. This construction affords a positive drive from the carriage 350 to the worm shaft 215 and the correct timing thereof, and in viewing Figure 15 it will be seen that leftward movement of rock 353 imparts counterclockwise rotation to gear 332, shaft 330, and bevel gear 326 (Figure 16) which in turn rotates bevel gear 325 in mesh therewith and its integral shaft 215 in a clockwise direction to ultimately produce a rightward movement of controller 210 (Figure 10) The controller 215 (Figure 10) is so mounted as to permit it to rock a suiilcient amount about its shaft 215 to freely follow the movement of control levers 280 as they are rocked about shaft 285 from one to another of their various displaced positions. Two projections 253 (Figure 2) are provided on the flange 253 of the nut 212 to serve as limit stops for the bail 219 connecting arms 211. The distance between the projections 268, however, is enough greater than the width of the bail to allow the required movement of the controller 218 and bushing 213 with respect to the nut 212 and member 259. 
 Shaft 285 (Figure 2 isprovided with a wide keyway into which keys 282 of members 280 extend; said keys being sufliciently narrower than their keyway to permit limited rocking movement of each of the levers 250 with respect to shaft 285. 
The controller 210 extends laterally a sufficient distance to insure that it will always engage in the recesses 215 of at least three adjacent members 280, and has three steps of different elevation, 211, 215a, and 213 (Figure 12), by virtue of which it positively positions the control levers 280 engaged thereby at as great a stagger with relation to each other as the keyway of shaft 285 will permit (see Figures 11B, 11C, and 11D). Each lever 280 has alaterally formed ear 233 overlying a nose 284 on the next lever to the right in such a manner that when a lever is positioned clockwise as shown in Fi ure 11D, all those to the right of it are positioned equally far clockwise, and 
when a lever is positioned counter-clockwise as shown in Figure 113, all to the left of it are positioned equally vfar counter-clockwise. Thus controller 210 serves to positively locate all levers 280' with respect to the keyway in shaft 285, the lever 280 engaged by the middle of controller 210 having its key located centrally of the keyway, all those to the right thereof against the lower side of the keyway and all those to the left against the upper side. 
 When a tabulator selection key 200 is depressed, a roller 216 (Figure 2) is moved upwardly to rock its respective lever 280 into a definite angular position, thereby rocking shaft 285 int a position determined by the angular relation existing between the lever 280 and the keyway in shaft 205, which in turn is determined by which side of the controller 210 the key is depressed. 
 As shown in Figure 10, controller 210 extends laterally a sufficient distance to engage in the recesses 216 of the three adjacent control levers 200 B, C, and D, and is formed with the previously described three offset portions 216d, 2", and 216, so that the three levers 266 B, C, and D so engaged by it will be rocked to three different angular positions with. respect to shaft 265, In the present example, the lever 2860 (Figures 110 and 12) aligned with the intermediate step 216a, of controller 216, has its key 232 intermediate the keyway of shaft 265, and the lever 2363 (Figure 11B) aligned with the lower step 271 has its key located against the bottom of said keyway. and the lever 2861) (Figure ill in. line with the upper step 2'56 has its key 232 located against the upper surface of the keyway in said shaft. 
 Figures 11A to 11E, inclusive, show control levers 280 positioned as they would be with the tabulator control key in line with lever 236 (Figure 11C) depressed. 
 If the tabulatcr key in control of lever 283 positioned; as shown in Figure 11A, hereinafter called'order A, is now depressed, the roller 2 of order C will be retracted from lever 2660 by the key of order C being freed to rise under pressure of spring 266 as described hcreinbefore, and the roller 256 of order A will press against the divergent side of 26! of control lever 226A to rotate said control lever clockwise about shaft 285. 
 Now in viewing lever 280A in Figure 10, which is from the left instead of the right as in the case of Figures 11A and 2, this setting movement of lever 286A forces its lateral extension 263 and arm 264 of lever 280B downwardly, which carries the controller 276 upward, thus rocking lever 280C and 28GB counter-clockwise. Lever 2661) (Figure 111)) represents the position of said lever before the setting occurred; therefore this upward movement of controller 216 just referred to, forces lever 286D further clockwise and the key 282 of said lever, being in the position shown in Figure 111), rocks shaft 236 with it an equal amount. 
 If a tabulator key on the other side of controller 210 is depressed, for instance the one which controls order D (Figure 11D), the roller 2 I of that order will be moved upwardly by said tabulator key, thereby rocking lever 260D countor-clockwise and forcing controller 226 downwardly, and in turn rocking levers 260C and 2663 counter-clockwise. Since the key 262 of lever 2863 (Figure 113) is against the upper surface of the keyway of shaft 265, this counter-clockwise movement rocks said shaft an equal amount in a counter-clockwise direction, instead of clockwise as was the case in the previous exam ple. Therefore, it is evident from the foregoing that the depression of a tabulator key on one side of the controller 210 rocks shaft 235 in one direction, but the depression of a tabulator key on the other side of said controller rocks shaft 265 in the opposite direction. 
 Fixed on the end of shaft 235 (Figure 8) by means of a key of the same width as the keyway of the shaft, is a right end control lever 28!! connected by a link 29! with a T member 282 pivotally mounted at 293 on the main starting lever 240, the operation of which will be described hereinafter. As shaft 265 is rocked in one direction or the other, as just described, the T member 292 will be rocked about its pivot 263 to carry one of its upper arms 284 and 265 over one of the ears 256 and 252 of shift operating lever 266' which, as hereinafter described, eflects operation of the carriage shifting mechanism in one direction or the other, according to the direction in which T member 262 is rocked.

Tabulator initiating mechanism The direction in which the carriage must be shifted in order to reach the desired position having been automatically determined, means are provided for initiating operation of the shifting mechanism to move the carriage to the desired position. 
 As previously described, the depression of a tabulator key 200 to the position shown in Figure 2 only conditions the tabulator controlling mechanism for a shift to a selected position. Means are provided, however, whereby a further depression of a key 206 will, if desired, actually initiate tabulation. 
 It will be noted that the roller 2l6 (Figure 2) of the lever 2l5 is at the entrance of the slot 236 of lever 23!), having already positioned said control lever; therefore, when the lever 216 is rocked further counter-clockwise, upon further depression of key 200, the roller 2" merely rises upwardly into the slot without imparting further movement to the control lever 286, but during the said movement of lever 2l5 its shoulder 2H contacts the flange 23f of the bail 236 pivotally mounted on shaft 236 and provided with a link 23! (Figures 4 and 9) pivotally attached to the rearwardly extending arm thereof by the shoulder stud 233. A notch 236 (Figure 9) is formed on the forward edge of link 23! to receive one end of a torsion spring 234, while the other end of said spring is held in a hole in the rear flange 01' the bail 235 so as to urge the link 231 clockwise about stud 233. On the rear side of said link is a shoulder 23! adapted to operate against the lower edge of lateral extension 26! (Figure 4) of a starting interponent 260 which is rockably mounted on a fixed stud 262, and urged to rock in a counter-clockwise direction by a spring 263 tensioned between the aperture 264 of the lever 266 and a stationary stud (not shown), such movement being limited by the bushing 26! of shaft 265. The upper edge of the lateral ex" tension 26! abuts the shoulder 266 (Figure 9) of the lower toggle link 265, also pivotally mounted on stud 262, the upper end of which link is pivotally attached to the upper toggle link 263 by stud 261, said upper toggle link having an elongated hole 266 at its upper end engaging a stud 242 on starting lever 246. 
 Said starting lever is pivotally mounted on a stud 243 attached to a frame of the machine, and to the top of its upwardly extending arm 244 is connected a tension spring 245, the lower end of which is securely fastened to the framing of the machine. This toggle link construction affords means for maintaining the starting lever 246 in its raised position (shown in Figure 9) against the tension of spring 245. It will be seen that the toggle is in a position just past center, 
 with a pressure being exerted from spring 246 to lever 246, to upper toggle link 268, thence to lower toggle link 265 which tends to rock counterclockwise about stud 262 under this pressure, but is limited by the bushing 261 onthe shaft 265. 
 When the tabulator bail 235 (Figure 4) is thus rocked counter-clockwise about the shaft 236, the link 23] is raised upwardly, and being held against the lateral extension 26l of the interponent 260 by spring 234, rides along the surface of the lateral extension 26l until its shoulder 239 abuts the lower edge of said extension, whereupon it rocks the interponent 266 clockwise about the stud 262. A similar clockwise movement is imparted to lower toggle link 265 (Figure 9) by the contact of the upper edge of the lateral extension 2" against the shoulder 266 of the toggle link 265 until the toggle link joint at 281 is forced past center, at which time the starting lever 248 is freed to be rocked downwardly about stud 243 by spring 245, carry-- ing with it the T member 232, which has been positioned over ear 252 or 25I, as previously described, to contact one or the other of the ears of the operating lever 258, and rotate the operating arm clockwise or counter-clockwise, thus actuating mechanism to engage the shift clutch I388 as described in the section entitled Carriage shift controlling mechanism. 
 A master tabulator key 228 (Figures 1 and 9) is also provided for initiating operation of the tabulator mechanism. This key is provided with two stems 22I guided for vertical movement on shaft 222 (Figure 9) extending through slots 223 in said stems, and pivotally connected at 221 to upward extensions of a bail 228 pivoted on shaft 238 and provided with a downward extension 228 adapted to contact a lateral extension 232 of bail 235 to rock the latter when key 228 is depressed. The key is normally maintained in raised position by spring 229 tensioned between the pivot stud 221 and a stud 225 on the machine frame, but upon depression will rock bail 235 to initiat operation of the tabulator mechanism as above described. 
 It is possible to initiate a tabulated shift by means of this master tabulator key 228 even though no tabulator key 288 stands depressed, since the keys 288 comprise what is known in the art as a flexible keyboard and any depressed key 288 may be caused to rise by depressing any other key 288 just sufilciently to move latch bar 2I3 enough to release the latched down stem 282 and then letting up the second key before it has been depressed far enough to cause its stem 282 to be latched down by bar 2 I 3. 
 Means are provided whereby the right end control lever 298 (Figure 8) will be automatically positioned for a tabulated carriage shift to the left wheneverthe master tabulator key i thus depressed without a carriage position having been selected by depressing a tabulator selection key 288. A spring 288 (Figure 8) is tensioned between an upper projection 299 of end control lever 298 and a stud (not shown) riveted to a frame of the machine, so that if no tabulator key 288 is depressed so that its stem 282 is latched down-the shaft 285 will be rotated to its extreme counterclockwise position, carrying T member 292 to the left Where its arm 294 overlies ear 25I of operating arm 288. Thereafter upon subsequent depression of the master tabulator key 228, a shift to the left will result. 
Tabulator arresting mechanism Mean are provided to stop a tabulated shift when the carriage reachesits tabulated position. Referring to Figure 10, assume a shift has been initiated from order C to order A in the manner previously described, in which the lever 288A and shaft 285 will have been rocked counter-clockwise (viewing Figure 10 from the left) the control lever 288A being positively held by its roller 2I6 (Figure 2) and the shaft 285 being held in position by the difference in the three elevations of the steps of the controller 218, which differentially positions the three lever 288 in contact therewith. 
 As the carriage and controller 218 traverse toward the controlling order (now order A) and the intermediate step 21641 of the controller moves into the bifurcation 216 of control lever 288A, the 
controller 218 will be forced downwardly by the difference in the elevation of the steps 211 and 216a, and will rock all control levers 288 to the right and left of lever 288A clockwise, as viewed in Figure 10. The shaft 285 thus will be freed by the levers 288 to the right of lever 288A and positively rocked clockwise by the control levers 288 to the left of lever 2881A. This rocking of shaft 285 back to neutral functions to arrest the tabulated shift in a manner to be described here- I lever 248 and means are therefore provided to recock this starting lever (Figure 9) by power derived from the shift clutch during the first cycle of its operation. On the downwardly extending arm 24I of the starting lever is riveted a roller 246 positioned to engage in the hook-shaped forward end of lever 388 so that when starting lever 248 moves downwardly the lever 388 is rocked counter-clockwise about shaft 38I, and, in turn, rocks the cam follower I341 clockwise about shaft 43I until roller I346, riveted to the rear end of said cam follower, contacts the low surface of the cam I345 which is secured to the shift jack shaft I33I (Figure 13) and i rotated whenever the shift clutch operates. At approximately the same time the roller I346 contacts cam I345, said cam begins to rotate and rocks the cam follower I346 counter-clockwise and lever 388 clockwise, thereby forcing starting lever 248 to its raised position as shown in Figure 9. The height of the cam I345 is preferably of such magnitude that the the starting lever 248 will be substantially overcooked, and the elongated hole 286 is provided for such overcocking and to allow the toggle links 288 and 265 to be returned to the position shown in Figure 9 by the torsion spring 259. The cam I345 makes one-half revolution for each shift cycle; therefore, the starting lever 248 is recocked at half cycle or one-quarter revolution of shaft I33I, following which the starting lever 248 is permitted to lower the stud 242 until it seats in the bottom of the elongated hole 286, and the remainder of the cycle idly rotates cam I345 until its low point again underlies the roller I346. 
If a tabulation is called for which will require six shift cycles before the tabulated position is reached, and the lever 248 is recocked during the first cycle, as 'just described, thus raising the T member 292 (Figure 8) with it and releasing the operating lever 258, the latter would, if allowed to return to its neutral position, stop the shift mechanism when only one of the six required cycles had been completed. 
 For this reason means have been provided to latch the operating lever 258 in its operative position until only a partial cycle of operation is necessary to reach the tabulated position, at which time the latch will be disengaged to free the lever 258 and stop the shift. 
 ing arm latch 385 (Figure 8) is rockably mounted other end against the stud 3; on lever 3I5 (Figure 5). As described in detail hereinbefore, the end control lever 298 (Figur 8) is rocked as For this purpose, operatsoon as the tabulatin r controls are conditioned for a shift, and remains in that position until the tabulated. position has nearly been reached; therefore, when said end control lever is rocked either clockwise or counter-clockwise from its central position, the roller 29% is removed from the nose of the latch 3G5, thereby releasing the latch to roclr clockwise under the urge of spring Elli until its lateral extension 301 abuts the projection 253 of the operating arm 250, and upon subsequent rocking of the operating arm 256 by T member 292 the projection 253 is removed from behind the lateral extension 301, 
allowing said extension to move to a. position v where it underlies or overlies the projection 253, thereby latching the lever 250 against return movement after the T member 292 is raised. 
 When the tabulated position has nearly been reached, however, the end control lever 290 returns to the position shown in Figure 8, causing its roller 296 to ride up the side of nose 309 and rock latch lever 305 counter-clockwise to remove lateral extension 30-? from underneath or above the projection 253 and allow operating arm 250 to return to its neutral position under the urge of spring i468 (Figure 14), thus terminating the shift, as previously described. 
 The means effective to stop the carriage shifting operation, initiated by the master tabulator key 226 without having first selected a position with a tabulator selection key 200, comprises a stud 3I3 (Figure 12) riveted to the center frame 3 of the machine so as to lie in'the path of controller 210. It will be recalled that the controller 21E- travels in the opposite direction to that of the carriage, so that for this automatic carriage shift to the left, the controller moves rightwardly. It will also be recalled that the controller 210 will have been, moved downwardly about its shaft 215, resulting from the rotation of shaft 285 and the rocking of control levers 280, and the only possible way to arrest a tabulated shift is to rotate shaft 285 back to neutral. For this purpose the stud EIE is in the form of a cone, the upper side of which serves to cam the controller 210 upwardly when it approaches its extreme right end position, thus rocking control levers 280 and the shaft 285 to their neutral positions and stopping the shift driving mechanism. 
 Means are provided to stop a rightward carriage shift initiated by the depression of the tabulator selection key EEG, followed by some manual misoperation such as immediately depressing another tabulator selection key just enough to release the first key, but not enough to latch the second key down, and then allowing said second key also to rise. With no selection key 200 depressed, no control lever- 280 will be positively held to stop a shift, and the driving mechanism might continue to run and attempt to shift the carriage beyond the right end position; therefore, a stud Zita, similar to the stud 3I3 (Figure 12) is riveted in the left side frame, located in the path of the controller Elli so that just before the carriage reaches its extreme right end position the controller will be cammed downwardly and rock the control lever 286', the shaft 285, and stop the shift driving mechanism. 
Dial clearance mechanism As shown in Figure 1, juxtaposed the master tabulator key 220 is a clear key I22, the depression of which releases all numeral keys I locked in a depressed position, and simultaneously returns to zero all keyboard. check dials MT, and a Middle dial. clear key 313 which controls one clear clutch to return to zero all product dials H8, and an Upper dial clear key It It provided to control another clear clutch to return to zero all counter dials IBM. 
 The numeral keys i0!) (Figure 18), secured to their respective key stems I03, are slidably mounted in their key frames 50! and normally held in a raised position by springs I02, but when one of said keys is depressed its lower edge is adapted to impinge upon one of the divergent sides I30 of the selection bar I20 and move it a proportional amount depending upon which key is depressed and lock said bar in a fixed position as the key stem enters the notch I 3| and, as described in detail in the aforementioned Avery patent, the movement of the selection bar I20 rotates the check dial I" a proportional amount, thereby registering the figure in said check. dial corresponding to the figure delineated on the numeral key depressed. 
 On the lower end of key stem I03 is a lug 0 with a curved surface at the bottom thereof, adapted to cam the lock bar II? to the rear against the spring II 8 until the lug II8 passes beneath said lock barand allows it to spring forward to a position where it overlies the lug I I0, thereby locking the key I00 in a depressed position against the tension of the spring I02 unti' the lock bar is again moved a suflicient amount to allow clearance for the lug I I6. 
 Means are provided whereby the depression of a single clear key will slide the lock bars in all orders of the machine simultaneously, and free all keys I00 locked in a depressed position. On shaft I28 (Figure 17), mounted transversely of the machine, is rockably mounted a clear ball I 25 which has an upwardly extending arm I27 underlying a roller I24 mounted on the stem of the keyboard clear key I22, said stem being slidably mounted in the usual way and maintained in a raised position by spring I23 tensl'oned between a lug on the lower end of the key stem and a stud riveted to the frame of the machine. When it is desired to clear the keyboard, the key I22 (Fig ures 1 and 17) is depressed and in its downward movement its roller- 2&- impinges the side of arm I21 and rocks bail I25 clockwise about shaft I20 until its pad 28 (Figure 18) contacts the slidable lock bars I IT and forces them to the rear, thereby releasing all depressed keys I 00 in the manner previously described. 
 When a depressed key 5 00 rises out of the notch I3I of its respective selection bar I20, as just described, said selection bar is free to move on its suspending links I28 and S29 (I29 not shown) in response to a spring provided for the purpose, to its forward position, thus by its connmtion to the check dial itl' restoring that dial to zero as shown completely in said Avery patent. 
 The product and counter dials are cleared by power derived from the motor, instead of manually as in the case of the check dial clearance just described. Keys 373 and I9I0 (Figure 1) are provided to control said motor power and the clutches driven thereby'to accomplish this clearance operation. 
 The Middle dial clear key 313 (Figure 19) by which the clutch 360 is controlled, is secured to the upper end of key stem 315 which is slidably mounted on a stationary shaft 3", and rockably mounted at its lower end to bail 3 by means of stud 31!, said bail being pivotally mounted on shaft 344, and a spring 313 .tensioned between the stationary shaft 314 and one end of stud 31!, thereby maintaining the key 313 and the bail 345 in the position shown in Figure 19. On the downwardly extending arm of bail 346 is a shoulder stud 349 adapted to operate in the L-shaped aperture 348 of link 34?, said link being provided with a nose 345 adapted to ride upon stud 343 secured to the framing of the machine when it is moved by bail 346. Rear end of link 34'! is connected to bell crank 33%, pivotally mounted on stud 311, and having a shoulder stud 318 secured to its upper end adapted to be embraced by the bifurcated forward end of clutch operating lever 319, said operating lever being made integral with clutch clog 35H which is normally held in position to lock clutch 333 against rotation by spring 382. 
 Thus clear clutch 333 is not effective to trans mit power from the motor until dog 38! is moved rearwardly to cause clutch engagement. The construction of this type of ciutch is well known and is similar to that shown in Figure 11 of Friden Patent Number 1,643,710 to which reference may be-had for details thereof. A cam 3S3-keyed to a sleeve integral with the driven side of clutch 383 is adapted to impart a clockwise rocking movement to cam follower 33 i, pivoted at 335, and held against the cam by spring 333, and to thus move the rigid U-section link 361 connected to the upper end thereof. The left end of link 361 is pivotally connected to a'lever 363 fixed to a sleeve 339, splined to slidable shaft 359 which shaft is journaled in and laterally shiftable with the carriage. This shaft is, therefore, rocked by operation of the clutch 363 no matter what the position of the carriage may be at the time. 
 From the foregoing it is evident that upon depression of key 313, clutch dog 33! is rocked counter-clockwise to release clutch 360 and upon engagement of said clutch cam 363 is rotated, the effect of which is to impart clockwise rocking movement to earn follower 354 and counter-clockwise movement to shaft 359 to return to zero all product dials, in amanner completely disclosed in the aforesaid Avery patent. 
 Means are provided to prevent continuous rotation of the clear clutch if the'operator should hold the clear key 313 depressed. When link 341 is moved forwardly as just described, its nose 345 rides up on stud 3433, thereby camming link 341 upwardly to a position where the L-shaped aperture of said link may move rearwardly under the urge of pring 332 until the clutch dog 38! contests the housing of clutch 360 on which it rides until said clutch completes its cycle. At this time the dog 38! drops into a recess on said clutch housing, thereby disengaging the clutch until key 313 is again depressed. When the operator releases the clear key, its stem 315 and hail 346 will be restored by spring 312, said restoration thus moving the stud 349 rearwardly until the link 341 can drop down to the position shown in Figure 19. 
 The clearance of the counter dials is accomplished in precisely the same manner as just described. The connection between the Upper dial clear key !9 I and its respective clear clutch I9! I, identical to clutch 380, is substantially the same as controlled by key 313. The engagement of clutch !9!! rotates cam l8l5, the effect of which imparts counter-clockwise rocking movement to cam follower !9!6 about shaft 365, clockwise rocking of lever !9!1 and shaft 354 to return to zero all counter dials, as described in detail in the aforesaid Avery patent. 
interlocks When the master tabulator key 220 is depressed simultaneously with either the clear key' 313 or NM, or both, typical in the operation of the present invention, it is necessary to provide means for disabling the shift controlling mechanism until the clearance operations are completed. Said means comprises, in the clear control trains, arm 403 and 430A (Figure 19) extending downwardly from hell cranks 31%, either of which is adapted to restrain the shift controlling mechanism. The shift control train includes the centralizer 6433, the lower end of which has pivotally connected thereby by stud Mi 8, the left end .of a link l lli on the other end or which is an elongated hole l3 l4 engaging with a stud dill secured to bail 433. This construction affords a lost-motion connection between bail and lever i433, when operated in one way, but a positive and effective connection when operated reversely, as will'be presently described. Bail is pivotally mounted on shaft 433 and the forwardly extending arm thereof is attached to the lower end of link 4%, the upper endoi which is pivotally connected to an arm of interlock 333. Said interlcck is pinned to shaft 333, and is provided on the upper end thereof with a lateral extension see adapted to cooperate with arm 403 cf bell crank Slit. 1 
 in the typical operation cited above, in which the master tabulator key and either or both of the clear keys are simultaneously depressed, the arm 430 (Figure 19) is lowered behind lateral extension 399 at the beginning of the downward movement of key 313 or !9!!i, to hold interlock 333 against clockwise movement, before either the shifting or clearing operations are initiated. As the keys are depressed further, the dog 38! releases clutch 368 to function at approximately the same time as the tabulated shift is tripped for initiation, which, as will be recalled from the previous description, drops T member 292 (Figure 9) onto one of the cars, 25! or 252, of operat- 'ing arm 2553 under the tension of spring 245, 
thus tending to rock arm 250 (Figure 14) and lever 5315, during which rocking, centralizer I403 must be forced to the left, carrying with it link Nit-(Figure 19). The stud 43!, being at the right end of elongated ho1e'l4i4 is thus forced toward the left to impart clockwise rocking of bail 402, upward movement to link 404, and clockwise rocking to interlock 333. But the arm 400, having been lowered behind lateral extension 399, prevents this rocking of interlock 393 and restrains the movement of the shift train just described, back as far as the levers i483 and I48! (Figure 14) which compress spring M93 and function to delay the shift operation until the clear clutch has completed its cycle. At this time the dog 38! (Figure 19) riding on the housing of the clutch 346, drops into a recess therein, and raises arms 403 and/or 400A to the position shown in Figure 19. The interlock 393 will thus be free to rock clockwise and allow the shifting operation to start. The function of noses 381 and 383, acting through car 384 to levers 385 and 388 to close the electric motor switch, is disclosed completely in the aforesaid Avery patent. 
 The performance of calculations on the calculating machine incorporating the tabulator above described, ordinaril involves an automatic shift of the carriage, or requires a traverse of the carriage by some means; and the tabulator was con- 7 ceived for the primary purpose of returning the carriage to a given. position after certain calculations and ensuing carriage shifting operations. Therefore, it is imperative to provide means for preventing operation of latch 305 (Figure 8) except when the tabulator controls are effective, in order to prevent certain misfunctions. From the foregoing description of the tabulator setting mechanism, it will be recalled that when the carriage is moved a slight amount out of its tabulated position, the shaft 285 and end control lever 290 is rocked to such an extent that roller 295 is removed from nose 309, thus releasing latch 305 into operation. This all occurs at the beginning of the first shift cycle which we may assume was initiated by an automatic shift in mulcontinue indefinitely sinc the latch 305 can be disengaged by the tabulating controls only. 
Means have been provided, therefore, to disable latch 305 except during a shift initiated by the tabulator controls, thereby making this misfunction impossible. Restraining lever 3I5 (Fig-. ure 5) is freely mounted on shaft 285 and is held in a position with its shoulder 3I1 normally against the roller 291 mounted on stud 293 (Fig ure 8) riveted to lever 240, by the pressure of torsion spring 3I0 against the stud 3I0. 3I8 is formed on the restraining lever 3I5, whicn operates in conjunction with the lateral extension 301 of latch 305, and the parts are shown in Figure 5 in the positions occupied when the tabulator starting lever 240 is inits raised or cooked position with the ear 3I8 restraining the clockwise movement of latch 305. If a shift is initiated by the starting lever 240, roller 291 travel downwardly with starting lever 240 and rocks member 3I5 clockwise about shaft 285 to remove ear 3E8 from behind lateral extension 301, thereby releasing latch 305 to latch operating arm 250. During the first shift cycle, when starting lever 240 and roller 301 are raised, lever 3I5 is also released to be raised by spring 3I0 until its ear 3I8 contacts the underneath surface 303 of lever 305, which has been rocked clockwise to engage operating arm 250. reached the latch 305 will be rocked counterclockwise in the manner described hereinbefore, thereby allowing the member 3I5 to rise to the restraining position shown in Figure 5. 
 If a directional shift key I405 or I400 is depressed, however, the starting lever 240 will not Anear. 
function, and latch 305 will be restrained, mak-. 
ing it possible for lever 250 to rock about shaft I485 and return to its centralized position upon release of the shift key. I v 
 Figure '1 illustrates the form of the lateral extension 301 which makes it possible for ear 35:; (Figures 5 and '1) of lever 3I5 to engage lateral extension 301 of latch 305 and still allow projection 253 of operating arm 250 to move up and down and also engage extension 301. 
Means are provided to disable the tabulator starting mechanism when the carriage occupies the position corresponding to a depressed tabulator key. 0n the lower section of control lever 290 (Figure 6) is riveted a stud 298 adapted to engage in the slot 32I. of tabulator disabling lever 320, said disabling lever being freely rockable on stud 252, and provided with a nose 322 adapted to engage one end of a stud 23! riveted to bail link 231. When the carriage occupies the position corresponding to a depressed tabulator key, the shaft 285 and control lever 200 are in their neutral position and hold the disabling lever 320 in the position shown in Figure 6 where its nose 322 lies in the path of stud 23I, so that upon depression of either the master tabulator key 220 or a tabulator selection key 200 to rock the tabulator bail 235 counter-clockwise and initiate a shift, the bail link 221 is rocked counterclockwise about stud 233 as the stud 23I rides over the end of nose 322, thereby preventing the contact of shoulder 230-(Fig'ure 4) of link 231 with the lower surface of the car 261 of the interponent 2B0, movement of which trips the toggle and releases the starting lever 240. If the carriage is out of the position corresponding to a depressed tabulator key, however, the shaft 205 and end control lever 290, as previously described, will have been rocked clockwise or counter-clockwise, thereby rocklng disabling lever 320 and moving nose 322 thereon out of the path of stud 23I, thus allowing bail link 231 (Figure 4) to function normally and initiate a tabulated shift. 
 Means are also provided to allow the'toggle and tabulator starting-lever 240 to return to and be locked in their initial positions, even though the operator may hold a tabulator key depressed after one-half of the first shift cycle has been completed. The starting lever 240 (Figure 9) its upward position, projection 241 will force link When the tabulated position is 231 out of engagement with interponent 260 and allow said interponent to return to its extreme counter-clockwise position before the starting lever 240 is recocked, thereby preventing repeated tripping of the starting lever 240 during each shift cycle. 
Typical methods of use in calculation Specific examples of the operations capable of being effected by the various tabulator keys and other control keys of the machine, will most clearly illustrate the advantages of the present invention in connection with a machine of the general type disclosed in the Patent Number 2,271,240. 
 In addition to the clear keys I22, I13, and I9I0 (Figure 1), the shift keys I405 and I400, and the automatic .tabulating shift described hereinbefore, the above mentioned machine comprises a zero multiply key MM and a series of multiplier keys 2002 for performing the multiplication of a number set up in the numeral keys I 00, a single depression of any one of which will effect a carriage shift one order to the left or to the right, depending upon which shift directional control key I20I or I202 has been previously set. 
 If, for example, in office routine calculations, an operator makes a series of computations of the same type, such as multiplication, in which the multipliers comprise from two to five digits, the operator may latch down the number four tabulator selection key which is to the high of the mean between the two and five digit multipliers just mentioned. If the size of the multipliers is usually the same, however, with only an occasional deviation therefrom, he will, of course, 
depress the tabulator selection key corresponding to the number of digits in the most; frequently occurring multiplier. Assume, however, that he selects and depresses thenurnber four tabulator selection key to effect return of the carriage to number four position after each calculation by the depression of the master tabulator key 220, simultaneously with the clear keys. If the multipiier oi the next example is a threedigit numher, for instance was, the operator will consecutively depress the l7--2-5 multiplier keys 260i and sees, the zero serving to shift the carriage one order to the left before the multiplication operation functions. It the multiplier in the next problem is a two-digit number, for instance 88, the operator will depress -0-6-8 on the multiplier keys, thereby shifting the carriage two orders to the left before effecting the multiplication by six and eight. If the next problem, however, has a five-digit multiplier, the operator will make a short depression of the right hand directional shift key sees and immediately begin the multiplication. 
 in another series of calculations the multiplier varies widely and lnconsistently, so that no position can be readily selected, the proper one of the series of tabulator selection keys can be completely depressed after each computation, and the carriage shift will be initiated and automatically terminated in the selected position. 
 For the convenience of operators who have become accustomed to starting all calculations with the carriage in one or the other of the extreme end positions, means have been provided whereby the present machine may be conditioned to return the carriage to either end position. The depression of the master tabulator key without any selection having been made by the depression of a tabulator selection key, will operate just the same as when the number one tabulator selection key is depressed and will always shift the carriage to the number one position; while, if the other extreme position is desired, the latching down of the stem 2% of the number eight tabulator selection key will always return the carriage to the other end position upon subsequent depression of the master tabulator key. 
 The entire arrangement possesses a flexibility that readily adapts it to use onany problems that may arise. For instance, if after using a number of multipliers ranging from two to five digits each, as above described, a number'of multipliers are encountered ranging from five to seven digits, the number six tabulator selection key may be depressed for the first one in this group, and then the master tabulator key used for the remainder of the group in the general manner above described. Also, instead of making a series of extensions in the order listed, an operator could at his option, first extend all calculations involving three-digit multipliers, then all those involving four-digit multipliers, et cetera, depressing the proper tabulator selection key for the first calculation in each group and the master tabulator key for the remainder of the group. 
 With the arrangement disclosed, the operator can utilize the master tabulator key in, any of these many ways to which it is adapted, and at the same time effect the clearance of any desired combination of dials, without any preconditioning operation being required in order to secure any of the many various results. 
 For instance, by depressing the master tabulator key and all three clear keys simultaneously, all dials will be restored to zero and the desired positioning oi the carriage secured, all by a single manual stroke of the operator. However, by merely varying the combination of keys simultaneously depressed, any one of a large number of different results may be secured by a similar time; while to accumulate products, he simultaneously depresses the master tabulator key 229, keyboard clear hey its, and upper dial clear key will; and to retain a constant multiplicand, he 
simultaneously depresses the master tabulator key 22d, the middle dial clear key tilt, and the upper dial clear key Kilt. [any of the above combinations executed Without the depression of the master tabulator lrey will clear the selected dials and leave the carriage fixed as may, for 
instance, be desired for making an addition. 
 Sequence of mechanical operations A summary of the functions or the mechanisms resulting from one of the foregoing examples will aid in understanding the invention as a whole; therefore, let us use the first example cited above, in which the number four tabulator selection key has been depressed to shift the carriage to the number four position, and in this case Figure 2 will represent the fourth or controlling order of the machine in which the tabulator selection key 2% has remained partially latched down by look A bar hit after the shittinitiated thereby, and the notch in the lower end of key stem 262 has forced lever 255 counter-clockwise so as to press its roller 2H3 against the divergent sides 2M of control lever 289 to rotate it to its intermediate position as shown. With the controller 216 in the position corresponding to the depressed key, its intermediate step 216A (Figure 12) is at rest in the controlling order with the shaft, 285 in neutral. Before the ensuing multiplication the shift direction control key Hill (Figure l) is depressed to control the automatic shift mechanism for a shift to the left, so that as an incident to the subsequent multiplication operation resulting from the manipulation of the multiplier keys 2002, an automatic shift, one order to the left occurs after the multiplication by'each digit, until the computation is completed and the carriage reaches the number one position. During the automatic shifting operation Just mentioned, the controller ill) (Figure 10) moves an equal amount, but to the right, and the control lever 280 (Figure 2) of the fourth order being held by roller fillt, controller 270 (Figure 10) is cammed upwardly and transmit its rocking movement to all control levers 28%! to the right of the control ling order. Shaft 235 is thus rocked clockwise, thereby rocking end control lever 299 (Figure 8) which through link 29| rocks 'l member 292 to the right, so that its arm 295 overlies the ear 252 of the operating arm 250. With the calculation completed and the tabulating mechanism thus automatically set, the dials of the machine are cleared by the simultaneous depression of the three clear keys 22, 313, and 1910 (Figure 1) and the master tabulator key 220 to initiate a tabulated return shift to the number four posioperating bail 235 counterclockwise, carrying the bail link 2st upwardly so that its shoulder 219 contacts the lower surface of lateral extension 28 l the upper side of which is in a position against the shoulder 265 so that upon clockwise rotation of the interponen't 286, the toggle joint 28! is moved to the right until it passes center to release operating arm 240 which rocks downwardly carrying with it the T member 292 and rocking operating arm 25s clockwise. 
 This results in a similar rocking of shaft 88 (Figure 14), thus moving arm 8! and link I483 to the left, the lever I315 clockwise, the link I!" to the right, control-dog I30! clockwise, and the dog I302 into engagement with ratchet I!" to initiate carriage shifting to the right. 
 During the first shift cycle the cam i345 (Figure 9) is rotated, thus camming roller I346 upwardly and forcing cam follower l3" counter-clockwise, lever 30!! clockwise, and starting lever 2" upwardly to a position shown in Figure 9, with the toggle links 288 and 265 and interponent 2" in the position shown to lock the starting lever 240 in its raised position. This recocking occurs during the first shift cycle, while threemore cycles are necessary to bring the carriage to the number four position. The T member 292 was thus raised from engagement with the operating arm 250 '(Figure 8), but said operating arm is held by latch 305, moved into engagement therewith at the beginning of the shift, which retains lever 25!] in its operating position until the tabulated position has been reached. 
 The controller 210 (Figure 10) moves'leftwardly towards the controlling order during this tabulated shift until it is forced downwardly by the controi lever 28!! of the controlling order, thereby rocking all the control levers except the number four counter-clockwise and forcing shaft 285 back to its neutral position shown in Figure 8. The end control lever 290 and its roller 29E thereupon engage the nose 305 and rock lever 305 counterclockwise to release the operating arm 250, thus stopping the shift.
