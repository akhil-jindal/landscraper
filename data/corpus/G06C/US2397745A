 'I'his application is a continuation in part of my application Serial Number 224,630 tiled August 12, 1938. 
 This invention relates to an adding machine with which is combined a multiplying arrangement capable of operating by shortened multiplication. 
 It is well known that multiplying can be done on adding machines by adding repeatedly the value set up, as by actuating the repeat key ,and pressing down the motor key repeatedly. This method of operating, however, requires keen attention on the part of the operator, and experience has demonstrated that it is not carried out without calculating errors. In order to overcome these difficulties a so-called multiplier setting mechanism has been provided on the adding machine and by means of this the repeat additions were carried out automatically by pressing a. suitable key. 
 However, this did not provide means for utilizing the adding machine for large scale multiplication operations, because the adding machine, as a result of the oscillatory movements of its principal parts, was too slow in operation for the purpose intended. 
 It is an object of the present invention to adapt an adding machine notwithstanding its relatively slower operation for use as a multiplying machine. The multiplier setting mechanism according to the present invention is arranged so that the values above 4 are calculated by shortened multiplication. 
 A further object of the invention is to provide a particularly simple construction wherein a shifting member actuated by the multiplier setting mechanism acts on the stem oi the motor key by means oi an intermediate member such as a lever or the like. 
 A further object of the invention is to provide an arrangement wherein the switch means of the multiplier setting mechanism, which determines whether addition or subtraction is to be used, is connected with the state control means of the adding machine for reversing the calculating mechanism gears so as to set them for the desired addition or subtraction.

Figure 18 is a cross sectional view taken on The adding and subtracting machine Arranged on the keyboard 30| of the adding lmachinein well known manner are the nine numeral keys 30|', which are designated 1-9. The zero keys 302, 303 and 304 cooperate in well known manner with the traveling setting pin carriage 305. R designates the repeat key through the setting of which the wel1 known clearing mechanism acting on the pin carriage is disconnected. 306 designates the clearing lever for the pin setting mechanism. The key 301 having the minus sign (-l sets the machine for subtraction, that is, by pressing such key. the means for reversing the calculating or totalizer gears is actuated to cause the calculating mechanism to operate subtractively. 308 designates the key by which the intermediate total is determined and 309 designates the total key. The operation controlled :by keys 308 and 309 need not be described since it is full shown in U. S. Patents to J. E. W. Greve, Nos. 1,897,932 granted February 14, 1933, No. 1,953,557 granted April 3, 1934. 
 The setting piece carriage 305 is provided below and above with two rollers 420 supported by upper and lower guide rails 42| attached to the machine frame. The pin carriage is provided with a plurality, in the present example ten, vertical rows of setting pins 333, each row comprising nine pins, so that the pin carriage of the present exemplary embodiment carries ninety such pins. The setting pins are set by means of the keys 30|' or 302, 303 and 304. 
 Zero key 302 is attached to a key lever 359 journaled on a shaft 360 attached to the machine frame. The lever 359 is provided with a downwardly extending arm 36| with which the forward end of a pin-setting rod 362 is engaged. The rear end of rod 362 is slidably guided 1ongitudinally in a perpendicular bracket plate 422 attached to the machine frame. This end of rod 362 extends within range of the lowermost sliding setting pins 333, which correspond to the ".value. The keys 303 and 304 act in a similar manner on similar rods. The operation of these keys is shown in Patent No. 1,707,303 granted to J. E. W. Greve, April 2, 1929. 
 The numeral keys 30|' are attached to the suitably formed nine key levers 423, which are also journaled on the shaft 360. Each key 1ever 423, except that which carries the 9", has a downwardly extending arm 424, each connected with the forward end of its individual pin-setting rod 425. The; rods 425 are heldso as to be longitudinally slidable at their rear free ends in the guide plate bracket 422. 
 The rod 425 which is connected with the key 30|' designated 1, acts on the second transverse row of sliding setting pins 333 which correspond to the value "1. The key 30|' designated by 2 cooperates with the rod which is coordinated with the third transverse row (from the bottom) of sliding setting pins 333, and so on. Keys 302 and 30| also cooperate with an escapement mechanism for the lateral movement of the carriage 305, which comprises the following construction. 
 The lower edges of the key levers 423 and 359 which carry the corresponding keys 30|' and 302 engage a cross bail 426, as shown in Fig. 5 are mounted in the arms 421 attached to the shaft 360, Iwhich is rotatably journaled in the machine frame. One arm 421 is connected by a pin 423 to one end of a link 429 which at the other end, is pivoted to a crank 430 attached to a shaft 43| rotatably journaled in a 'bearing 432 attached to the machine frame. 
 An escapement member 433 is also' attached to shaft 43| and carries a holding tooth 433 normally out of engagement with a horizontal escapement rack 3|0 mounted on the pin carriage 305. (See Fig. 5.) A co-acting escapement member 434 is slidably mounted on the escapement member i433. For this purpose, the two attaching screws 435 engage the escapement member 433 through slots 436 of escapement member 434. The upper escapement member 434 is provided with a tooth 431 corresponding to the tooth 433' and normally engaging the escapement rack 3|0. A traction spring 439 attached at 440 to the escapement member 433, and at 438 to the escapement member 434, tends to shift the shiftable escapement member 434 in t-he direction of the arrow in Fig. 5, but is prevented from movement by the engagement of its tooth -431 with the rack 3I0 attached to the carriage. 
 If one of the keys 30|' or 302 is depressed not only is the corresponding setting pin 333 of the vertical pin row in front of the rods 425 moved to the right from the position shown in Fig. 3, but also, at the same time, by means of the elements 426 to 430, the escapement; member 433 is swung, against the traction of a spring 44|, into the dotted line position of Fig. 3 to engage its tooth 433' with rack 3|0, while tooth 431 of escapement member 434 is released therefrom and moves to the dotted line position of Fig. 5 through the traction of spring 439. 
 When the depressed key is released, then, the spring 44| rocks the escapement member 433 downwardly to disengage its tooth 433' from rack 3|0 and simultaneously engage the spring urged tooth 431 with the rack 3|0. Under the pull of the stronger traction spring 442 engaged with the pin carriage, the carriage is moved in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 5 for the distance of one rack tooth and the escapement member 434 again assumes the position shown in full lines in Fig. 5. The carriage 'has thereby been moved the distance between adjacent rows of pins 333. 
 Associated with pin carriage 305 are a number of type carrying bars 330, of which, as shown in Figs. 2a and 5, eleven are provided arranged in adjacent relationship. It is to be noted that ten of these bars carry the types 0"9", while the eleventh has mounted therein the types representing the symbols or signs. The individual types 33|. are arranged slidably on the bars 330. Provided at the lower end of each' type bar 330 is a projecting shoulder 332 which extends 'within range of the setting pins 333 slidably mounted in pin carriage 305. 
The type bars 336 are also each provided with bar 335 engages. The bar` 335 is carried by a slide 336 which is moved upwardly by a link 331 connected thereto and a control lever 336 connected to link 331, when the machine is operated. In this manner all the type bars 330 are released, so that they can pass upwardly under the pull of the traction springs 485 engaged with projections 464 thereon until th'e corresponding shoulders 332 contact the ploiected setting pins 333 of the pin row coordinated therewith. 
 A rack 443 associated with each type bar 338 is provided with two pins 444 engaging in slots 445 of the bars 338. Each rack is provided with an arm 446 to which' a traction spring 441 is engaged. The other end of spring 441 is attached to the bar 336 with which the rack 443 is associated. The spring 441 tends to move the rack 443 relative to the bar 338 in th'e direction of the arrow in Fig. 3. 
 The control of the bars 336 and consequently the actuator racks 443 is described in the above mentioned Patent No. 1,707,303. This control acts on the bars 336 so as to retain in lowered position, those bars 338 into whose path no pin in the carriage 365 has entered. 
The calculating mechanism gears and reversing means therefor Coordinated with the racks is a calculating mechanism consisting of a suitable number of totalizing gear wheels 448. The gears 448 are journaled on a shaft 448, mounted in the two parallel end plates 456 and 45| which are pivoted intermediate their ends to the upper ends of levers 452 at 453, and th'e levers 452 are disposed at both sides of the set of the type carrying bars 336. The levers 452 are interconnected at the bottom by a crossbar 454 and are mounted oscillatably on a trunnion 455 attached to the machine frame. 
 Each gear 448 of the calculating mechanism is engaged with a reversing gear 456 individual thereto. The gears 456, which have the same number of teeth as the gears 448, are journaled on a shaft spindle 451 parallel with the shaft spindle 446 and likewise attached to the two frame plates 456 and 45|. Engaged with forward end of the plate 450, at 458, is a link 456 connected by a pivot pin 460 to a lever arm 46| fixed to the shaft 352 journaled in the machine frame 3 I6. A double crank 353, provided at both diametrically opposite ends with pins 354 and 355 is xed to shaft 352. By rocking the double crank 353 into the dotted line position of Pig. 3. the rocking calculating wheel frame including the end plates 456 and 45| is swung about the pins 453 so that the calculating mechanism gears 448 unmesh from and the reversing gears 456 mesh with the differential racks 443. In this manner a certain predetermined movement of the racks in one di rection with respect to the calculating mechanism gears 448 is reversed to the opposite direction and brings about the opposite method of calculation, that is, the value based on the magnitude of the rack movement is not added, but subtracted. 
 The tens transfer for the calculating mechanism 448, 456 is effected through the lever arm 602. The details of the tens transfer are described in Patent No. 1,897,932 granted to J. E. W. Greve, February 14, 1933. 
 The double crank 353 is set in one or the other terminal position by a pitman 356 provided with the two shoulders 351 and 358 and is journaled at one end at 462 on the end of arm 463 fast on a counter shaft 328 journaled in the machine frame 3|6. Also mounted on the countershaft 326 is a bellcrank lever 328 connected by a link 326 to an arm 324 attached to the main drive shaft 323. Through a means hereinafter described, the main shaft describes an oscillatory movement which is transmitted through the link 326 into a similar movement of the arm 463 connected to the countershaft 326. 
 A pin 464 attached toA an arm 465, engages under the pitman 356. Arm 465 is an extension of the key lever 466, which is journaled on the fulcrum 366 and which carries the subtraction key 301 bearing the minus sign. It is apparent that by pressing on the key 381, the pitman 356 is swung upwardly so that the shoulder 351 comes in front of the pin 354. 
 If the double crank 353 was previously in the position shown by the full lines in Fig. 3, then, in the rearward travel of the arm 463, the double crank 353 will be swung by the pitman 356 into the dotted line position in Fig. 3 and the calculating mechanism gears 446 and 456 thus moved to the subtracting position. 
The motor drive and coupling means The keyboard. 36| is also provided with the motor key 3I| (Fig. 1) carried by the stem 3|2. The lower end of stem 3|2 is pivoted at 3|3 to an arm 3| 4 fixed to shaft 3|5 journaled in the machine frame 3|6. Connected to shaft 3 |5 is another arm 3|1 to which a connecting rod 3|6 is connected. 'Ihe arm 3|1 is under the action of a spring 3H to return the motor key 3|| after such key has been released. Rod 3|8 (Figs. 2 and 2a) is connected by a pivot pin 461 to the lever 468 which actuatcs the clutch and contact devices and which is journaled at 466 in the housing 3|6. 
 Attached to one end of the lever 466, with an interposed insulating member 416, is an electrical switch member 41| which cooperates with the two spring pressed contacts 412. The springs of the contacts are in the circuit of an electric motor 413, on the shaft 414 of which is attached a worm gear 415 which meshes with a worm gear 416 attached to a vertical shaft 416 journaled in bearings 411 and 418 (Fig. la) in the housing 3|6. 
 Attached to the shaft 416 is a ratchet tooth 466 with which the nose 462 of a pawl 46| cooperates. Pawl 48| (Fig. 1a) is pivoted at 463 on a cam disc 464 freely rotatable on the Vertical shaft 419. A pressure spring 465, supported on a projection 466 on the cam disc 464 acts on the pawl 48|. Cooperating with the free end of the pawl 46| is the hook end 461 of the lever 466, so that when the lever 466 assumes the position of Fig. 2a the hook end 461 holds the nose 462 of the pawl 46| out of engagement with the ratchet tooth 460. 
 Cooperating with the cam disc 464 is a cam roller 488 mounted on one arm of a forked lever 466 pivoted on pin 460 provided in the housing 3|6. The other arm of lever 466 is pivotally connected by pin 46| to a link 462 which, in turn, is pivotally connected to the rear end of a transmission rod 328. The other end ofrod 320 is pivotally connected by pin 32| to lever arm 322 fixed to main shaft 323. 
 Thus, if the motor key 3| is depressed, then, by means of the arms 3|4 and 3|1, the connecting rod 3 8 is moved to the left as shown in Figs. 1, 1a, 2 and 2a and the lever 468 is swung in the direction of the arrow in Fig. `2a whereby, through the switch member 41|, the circuit for the electric motor 413 is closed and at the same time the hooked end 481 of the lever 468 releases the pawl 48|, so that its nose 482 may be engaged by the ratchet tooth 480. 
 In the ensuing rotation of the vertical shaft 419 by motor 413, the cam disc 484 is carried along and rocks the lever 489 to rst draw, the transmission rod 320 to the right from the position shown in Figs. l, 1a, 2 and 2a thereby rotating the main shaft 323 counter-clockwise. The spring 493 connected at one end to the frame and at n the other end to rod 320 maintains roller 488 in contact with cam disc 484 and returns the transmission rod 320 to its initial position. thereby rotating shaft 323 clockwise and returning the members connected therewith to normal. 
 It is to be noted that during the swinging movement of the arm 322 in the direction of the arrow in Fig. l, the type carrier and rack restraining and restoring bail 335, 336 is moved upwardly, so that the type carrier and rack bars 330 are released and can pass upwardly due to the traction of the springs 495 engaging projections 494 on the type carriers,A until the projecting feet 332 strike against their corresponding extended sliding pins 333. The stop for the key designated 9, is the abutment plate 600 (Fig. 3). Ii such key is depressed the pin carriage 305 makes an advance without one of the pins 333 being moved out. The corresponding typecarrying bar 330 can then ascend until its foot 332 strikes against abutment plate 600. This operation is also described in Patent No. 1,707,303y 
Engaging and disengagng the calculating gears and their racks It is to be noted primarily that during the upward movement of the type carriers and rack bars 330 the calculating mechanism gears 448 and 456 must not operate. On the other hand, the calculating gears are to be swung into operative position, that is, into engagement with their racks 443 prior to the return of the type carrier and rack bars 330 to the initiall position. For this purpose the control means shown particularly in Fig. 4 are provided. 
 Fixed on one of the arms 452 of a U-shaped bail member 452, 454 journaled on a crossrod 455 near the base of the machine, is a pin 491 which cooperates with a latch 498. The latch is journaled at 499 to a frame extension arm 500 and is subjected to the action of a traction spring 50| which always tends to hold latch 498 engaged with the pin 491. The free end of latch 498 is provided with a pin 502, with which a toggle pawl 503 cooperates. 'I'he toggle pawl is pivoted at 504 to the free end of swinging arm 505 attached to counter-shaft 329. In the initial position of the machine, the arm 505 assumes the position indicated in Fig. 4 by the full lines, and the finger-like extension 506 of the toggle pawl 503 is applied, through the pull of the engaging traction spring 501, against the pin 502. However the spring 501 is so weak that it can not overcome the action of spring 50|. 
 Mounted on a prolongation of the bail arm 452. on which pin 491 is provided, is another pin 508 over which the forked end provided on one arm of a lever 509 engages. The lever 509 is journaled at` 5|0 on the machine frame 3|6. The free end of lever 509 is provided with a stud 5H en- 'gageable by the toggle pawl 503 carried by the arm 505. 
 The motor key 3|| (Figs. 1, 1a, 2 and 2a) upon depression, starts the motor 413 which rotates the main drive shaft 323 counter-clockwise which through the link 326, rocks the countershaft 329 and its arm 506 counter-clockwise in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 4. In this swinging movement, the lower shoulder of the toggle pawl 503 strikes against the pin 502 to disengage the latch 498 from the pin 491 so that the bail arms 452 together with the calculating mechanism gears 448 and 45B can swing through the traction of spring 5|2 to the right, as shown in Fig. 4, to disconnect the gears o1' the calculating mechanism from the racks 443. After the pawl 503 has escaped past the pin 502, the 
 latch 498 is again drawn into its operative position, wherein the prolonged end of latch 498 rests on the pin 491. Thus, immediately after the beginning of the upward movement of the type carrier bars 330, the calculating mechanism gears are rocked to their inoperative position. 
 When the main drive shaft 323 reaches its extreme clockwise limit of travel, the arm 505 assumes the dotted line position of Fig. 4, in which position the finger-like extension 506 of the toggle pawl 503 is applied against the stud 5H of the lever 509 which, because of the rocking of the totalizer supporting bail arms 452 when disconnecting the calculating gears 448, 456 from their type carrier and rack bars 330, is in the dotted line position of Fig. 4 corresponding to the position of the bail arms 452. At the beginning of the reverse or return rotation of the countershaft 329, and therefore, before the downward movement of the type carrier and rack bars 330, the upper shoulder of the toggle pawl 503 strikes against the stud 5H and the lever 509 is swung back into the position shown in full lines in Fig. 4. 
 In this swinging movement of the lever 509, pin 508 moves the bail arms 452 and the calculator gears 448, 456 back to the initial position shown in full lines in Fig. 4. As soon as this initial position is reached, the latch 498, due to the action of spring 50|, grips the pin 491 to retain the caliilator gears 448, 456 connected with their racks The state control pitman 356 (Fig. 3) is timed to operate during the initial half of the rocking stroke imparted to the main drive shaft 323, to adjust the calculator gear frame 450 to determine whether the positive gears 448 or the negative gears `.456 shall be engaged with the racks 443 of the type carrying bars 330 on the return of the gears to engagement with said racks. 
 After such re-engagement of the selected set of calculator gears with their racks, the restraining and restoring bar 335 (Fig. 1a) is lowered to return the actuated type bars 330 to their normal home positions, during which return, the calculating gears are diierentially rotated in a positive or negative direction, depending upon which set of gears 448 or 456. is engaged with the racks 443. 
The printing mechanism The printing mechanism which enters into 0peration when arm 505 assumes the dotted line position of Fig. 4 operates in the following manner. 
 It is first to be noted that the plungers 343, shown in Fig. 1, are opposite the ribbon 490. The hammer levers 345, mounted oscillatably on the common shaft 34B, cooperate with the plungers, which are guided axially by, and are slidable in the support 344 being held by the springs 343' in the position shown in Fig. l. The hammer levers 345 are subjected to the action of springs (not shown) which tend to swing them in the direction of the arrow shown in Fig. l. The tensioning of the hammer levers 345 is eected by the crossbar 341 forming part of the rocking hammer releasing and restoring bail 341, 348 connected with a lever arm 349 in the slotted end 350 of which a pin 35| on one arm of the bell crank lever 328 engages. The hammer levers 345 are provided with the well known checks, stops or the like which,l when the machine is actuated, and assuming that it is set for printing, are released, so that, under the pull of the springs engaged therewith the hammer levers contact the reinforced ends of the plungers 343 and move these so that they strike the type in front of them against the paper 34| with the ribbon 496 interposed. 
 The above well known arrangements, which serve for addition and subtraction, are coordinated with a multiplier setting mechanism, de- 
scribed hereinafter and by means oi' which shortened multiplication is possible. 
The multiplier setting mechanism The parts belonging directly to the multiplier setting mechanism are mounted on the base plate |03, attached by screws 383 and 354 to the machine frame 3|E of the adding machine. The multiplier setting mechanism has ten multiplier setting keys 91 bearing the indicia 09 which are disposed at the right of the keyboard of the adding machine. 
 Each of the keys 91 is mounted on a stem 98 f Figs. '7 and 1l). The upper ends of the stems 98 are guided in slots 99 provided in an upper keyboard plate |00, while the lower ends are guided in corresponding slots of a lower keyboard plate |0I attached by cross members |02 to the upper key board plate |00. 
 The cross members |02 are fixed to the frame wall |03 by the screws |04. Encircling the lower end of the key-stems 98 are the springs |05 which urge the cross extensions |08 on the key-stems against the lower face of the upper key board plate |00 and thus tend to hold the key-stems in the initial position. 
The main shaft oscillation control Longitudinally slidable between the two rows of key-stems 93 is a rectangular tube |01 constituting a differential bar which is guided in suitable apertures I08 provided in the cross members |02. Attached to the lower face of the tubular differential bar |01 is a bearing eye |09 which extends downwardly through a longitudinal slot provided in the lower key board plate |0|.- Journaled in the eye |09 by the pivot pin I I0 is a latch Il with which a spring 2 engages and which tends to force the latch upwardly. In the initial position shown in Fig. 'l the nose ||3 of the latch is applied against the end II4 of the longitudinally extending slot I5 provided in the lower key board plate |0|. A traction spring ||1 engages at one end the pin ||8 provided on the difierential bar 01 and at the other end is attached to the front cross member |02. This spring urges the differential bar |01 to the left, as shown in Fig. '1. In the normal position shown in Fig. 7 the differential bar is locked by the latch nose The hollow differential bar |01 is provided on both sides with window-like openings II8 (see Fig. 17) which connect with recesses Ils provided on the upper side of thedifferential bar. When the differential bar |01 is in the normal position, these recesses ||9 are positioned exactly under the cross extensions |08 of the multiplier keystems 98. It is to be noted that the recesses ||9 are substantially only as wide as the thickness of the multiplier key-stems 98. Also, the windowlike openings II8 are so arranged with relation to the recesses |I9 that, when the cross extensions |06 of the multiplier key-stems have entered the recesses I I8 due to pressure on the keys, and the latch |I I is released, the differential bar |01 may advance various extents of travel under control of the particular multiplier key depressed. and according to a system of shortened multiplication. Thus, with respect to the row of multiplier keys of the lower digit values 0 to "4 inclusive, the opening |I8 coordinated with the 0 key permits movement of the differential bar for the distance the opening coordinated with the 1 key for the distance 21:, and the opening coordinated with the "4 key permits a movement of the distance 51:, etc. It is the same with the multiplier keys 59 of higher digit value, which permit the differential bar to advance graduated extents corresponding to the complementary values of the multiplier keys. The opening I I8 coordinated with the I5 key thus permits a movement of the distance 5x and the opening I8 coordinated with the 9 key permits a movement of the distance 1.'. 
 A rack ||9' is attached to the rear end oi' the square tubular differential bar |01 and engages gear |20 journaled at |20' on the base plate |03 and connected to a ratchet wheel |2|. A one tooth shift or rotation of the wheel I 2| will cause a movement of the rack I I9' and consequently of the differential bar |01 for a distance .'v. 
 Associated with the lower ends of the two rows of multiplier key-stems 98 are the two parallel motion bars |22 and |23 which are supported near their opposite ends by the respective pairs of parallel links |25 pivoted at |24 to the bottom of the lower keyboard plate I 0|. Angular links |21 and |28 (see Figs. l and 9) are pivoted at |26 to the respective rear ends of the parallel motion bars |22 and |23. The link |21 is provided at its lower end 'with a slot |29 in which a pin |3| provided on an operating arm |30 engages. 'I'he operating arm |3015 oscillatably journaled on a pin |32 attached to the frame wall |03. The lower end of the companion link |28 (see Fig. 11) is provided with a slot |33 into which extends a pin |34 attached to an operating arm |35 which is likewise Journaled on pin |32. 
 Extending into the path of movement of the parallel motion bars |22 and |23 (see Fig. 9) is a pin |4| which is attached to a latch-disengag lng lever |42 pivoted at its front end to the frame |03 at |43. A traction spring |44 (see Figs. 'l and 8) is engaged at I 42' with the latchdisengaging lever |42, and the spring |44 tends to hold the lever |42 in the position shown in Fig. 1. Journaled on the latch-disengaging lever |42, at |45, is a pawl |46 having a projecting shoulder |41 which engages a shoulder |48 provided on the locking latch for the difierential bar |01. A spring |50 engages the pin |48 on the pawl |46 to hold the pawl in its effective position as determined by contact of the pin |5| on the pawl |46 against the upper edge of the latch-disabling lever |42. 
 Cooperating with the ratchet wheel |2| is a motor tripping member |52 journaled oscillatably at |53 on the base plate |03. 
 The motor tripping member |52 has an arm |54 which in one position of the member, serves as a locking dog for the ratchet Wheel |2|. The motor tripping member is retained in the position shown in Figs. 1 and '7 by the locking tooth |55 formed on the rear end oi' a locking lever |51 pivoted at |58 on the frame wall |03. The locking tooth seats in a recess provided in the locking dog |54 of the motor tripping member |52. 
 Journaled on the free depending end oi' the forward arm of the locking lever |51 at |58, is a detent |60 with which is engaged one end of a torsion spring |6|, the opposite end of the spring being supported by a pin 381 projecting from one arm of a restoring bell crank 388 (Figs. 1 and 13) pivoted at 388 to the side wall |03, and hereinafter more fully explained. For the present, the restoring bell crank normally lies at its counter-clockwise limit o! travel shown in Fig. 13. Engaged with the locking lever |51, as shown, is the traction spring |83, which tends to hold the locking tooth |55 in engagement with the recessed dog |54. By means of the torsion spring |6|^, the detent |60 is given a tendency to swing counter-clockwise about pivot |58 to press a lateral projection on the upper end of the detent, against the projecting end of the pivot pin for the diiferential bar latch The motor tripping member |52 is subjected to the action of a traction spring |65 which tends to turn the tripping member clockwise. The spring |65 is connected to an arm |66 of the tripping member |52, said arm |66 having a pin |61 connected to a thrust bar 68 (Figs. 1 and 8) mounted on the inner face of the frame wall 03, the pin |61 passing through a slot |68 of the side wall |03. The thrust bar |68 is provided with a longitudinal slot (Fig. 8) into which extends a pin |1| projecting from the inner face of the wall |03 (Fig. 8). The left end 310 of the bar 68 extends to a point adjacent to a pin 31| (Fig. l) on a rocker 312 pivoted at 313 to the frame of the adding machine and provided with an extended finger 314 which engages over a pin 315 provided 0n the stem 3|2 of the motor key 3| The pin 381 on the rear arm of the restoring bell crank 388, serving as a support for the spring |6|, extends into the plane of movement of the angularly bent end of the detent |60. The forward arm of the restoring bell crank 388 has a cam-like end 380 extending into the range ofmovement of an actuating arm 201 journaled at 208 (Fig: 13) on the outer face of the supporting side wall |03, and operable from the main drive shaft 323 or by the "0 and 9" multiplier keys, as will be explained in their proper order. 
The step by step return of ratchet wheel Attached to the main drive shaft 323 is a crank 400 (Figs. 1 and 6) to the free end of which, at 40|, there is secured a connecting rod 402 pivoted at the other end on the pin 403 at the end of driving lever 405 is a pin 401 which extends through a corresponding slot 401' in the supporting plate to a point adjacent the depending arm |11 provided on a ratchet restoring slide |14 arranged parallel with the inner face of the frame wall |03 so that said depending arm normally extends transversely of the slot 401' (Fig. 13). The slide 14 is longitudinally slidable on frame wall |03 and for this purpose is provided with longitudinal slots |15 through which the screws |16 attached to the wall |03 project. Journaled on the restoring slide |14 by pin |18 is a pawl |80, to the tail of which, at |8|, there is attached a traction spring |82 and the other end of the spring is attached, at |83, to the restoring slide |14. The lever-like plate |80 is provided with a rectangular bent extension |84 which extends through a guide aperture |85 provided in the frame wall |03 within range oi' the ratchet wheel 2| (see Figs. 6 and 13). 
 Near its rear end, the ratchet-restoring slide |14 is provided with a downwardly extending projection |86 (see Figs. 6 and 13) cooperating projecting from a point near the free end of a driving lever 405 oscillatably journaled at 406 on the outer face of the side wall |03. Provided with the projection |81 of a sliding plate |88 longitudinally guided by slots |88 provided therein through which extend pins attached to the frame wall |03. The vtraction spring 8| engaged with the sliding plate |88 tends to move the plate to the right as shown in Fig. 6. Provided on the sliding plate |88 is a pin |82 which extends into the plane of an abutting surface |83 provided on detent |80. 
 Pivoted to thrust bar |68 at 2|5 is the dog 2|4, with which the torsion spring 2|6 engages to rock the dog counter-clockwise (Fig. 6) until arrested by contact of the angular projection 2|1 of the dog 2|4 against the upper edge of the bar 68. (Figs. 8 and 8.) 
The carriage shift control Coordinated with thrust bar |68 on the inner face of the frame wall |03, is an operating slide 365 provided with longitudinal slots 361 and 368. Engaging through the slot 361 is the guide pin 366 attached to the frame wall |03. A stud 206 mounted in the free end of the operating arm 201 which, it will be recalled, is pivoted to the outer face of the frame wall |03, extends through a slot 206 (Fig. 8) in said wall and through the slot 388 in the operating slide 365 on the inner face of the frame wall, the slots 208' and 368 being normally in substantial register. The operating slide is provided with a shoulder-like projection 368 which cooperates with the correspondingly formed projection 385 of the dog 2 |4. 
 A release bell crank lever 382 (Fig. 6) is pivoted at its angle at 38| to the inner face of the frame wall |03, the rea-r arm of the bell crank extending upwardly to a point adjacent a pin 386 projecting from the dog 2|4 on the thrust bar |68. The forward arm of the release bell crank 382 extends into the return path of a stud 388 projecting from an arm 388 (see also Fig. 2) fast on the main drive shaft 323. 
 When the main drive shaft is at rest, the stud 388 of arm 388 contacts the forward arm of the bell crank 882 to rock it to, and retain it at, its counter-clockwise limit of travel. 
 Upon a cycling of the machine, the main drive shaft 323 will first rock counterclockwise with its crank 400 to remove the stud 388 from the end of the forward arm of the release bell crank 382, which frees the bell crank for clockwise movement under the action of a spring 384 connected at 383 to the rear arm of the bell crank. 
Means for aligning and disalgning the corresponding openings in the differential bar and the compensating bars. 
 Considering the case in which, through shortened multiplication in the immediately preceding 4decimal position, the next decimal position is greater by the value 1 than the value of the number, two U-shaped channel bars 221 and 228 are longitudinally slidably positioned (see Fig. 1'1) in the hollow, tubular differential bar |01. The channel bars or compensating bars 221, 228 lie parallel within the diierential bar, with their open faces apposed, and their webs facing outwardly adjacent the opposed series of openings i I8 in the side walls of the differential bar. The webs of the respective compensating bars 221', 228 each have a series of graduated openings 229 formed therein corresponding with, and under certain conditions, adapted to register with the respective series of graduated openings ||8 of the differential bar. Attached to each compensating bar is a pin 230 (Fig. 7) which extends through a slot 23| provided in each side wall of the differential bar |01. pin is a traction spring 232, fastened at the other end, at 233, to the diilerential bar |01. The springs 232 thus tend to move the U-shaped compensating bars 221 and 228 relative to the differential bar |01, in such direction that the pins 230 are applied against the right or rear ends of the slots 23|. In this position of the compensating bars 221 and 228 relative to the differential bar |01, the operative rear edges of the openings 8 are in operative relation to the rear edges of the openings 229 of the compensating bars 221 and 228. These compensating bars, however, as explained hereinafter, can, also, alternatively assume another position in which the corresponding rear edges of the window-like openings 229 project forwardly of the rear edges of the window-like openings ||8, for a certain distance. This distance corresponds to the afore-mentioned distance ar, which at the same time represents a one step movement of the ratchet wheel |2l. 
 This alternative position of the compensating bar 221 or 228 relatively to the differential bar |01 is maintained during cycling of the machine by the catches 234, 231, one for each of the compensating bars, which catches are pivotally mounted at 235 to their respective compensating bars to travel therewith. The teeth 238 of the respective catches 234, 231 enter notches 239 formed on the upper edges of the reduced side walls of the differential bar |01 at its rear end. 
 In the normal positions of the parts with the machine at rest 'and set for additive or positive multiplication, as shown in Fig. 7, the tooth 238 f the catch 234 is seated in its notch 239 of the differential bar to cause the differential bar, when advanced by its superior spring II1, to draw with it the compensating bar 221. 
 The catch 231 of the compensating bar 228, under the above conditions is normally disengaged from its notch 238 in the diierential bar, so that the differential bar will have a one step advance or lead before the rear end of the slot 23| in the diierential bar picks up the pin 230 of the left Engaged with eachv hand compensating bar 228 associated with the row of multiplier keys of higher value. 
 Upon the return of the diilerential bar |01 to its normal home position. and as it starts on its last step of return travel, the rear end of that compensating bar which is not connected with the dlil'erential bar, contacts and is arrested by an abutment 288' (Figs. 12 and 19) carried by an overhanging bracket 288 fastened at 302 to the rear frame plate, and as the diierential bar reaches its home position, the rear end of that compensating 4bar which is connected with the differential bar contacts the abutment and is slightly displaced suillciently to relieve the frictional engagement of the catch with its notch 239. 
 After the return of the din'erential bar is complete, either catch 234, 231 may be selected for 0P- eration depending upon the value of the multiplier digit key to be set. Y 
 Torsion springs 235' (see Fig. 19) urge the projections 238 of the catches 234 and 231 into the corresponding notches 239 of the differential bar |01 provided their own weight is not suillcient to do so. 
Setting control The rear ends of the catches 234 and 231 are reduced to form tails extensions 240 which extend obliquely rearwardly into the range of the laterally projecting abutment ilngers 24| and 242. The finger 24| is attached to the angular extension of a catch-controlling bar 243, while the linger 242 is attached to the angular extension of a catchcontrolling bar 244 (see Fig. 9) arranged in parallel spaced relation with its companion catchcontrolling bar 243. 
 The catch-controlling bars 243 and 244 are vertically slidable on the inner face of the rear frame plate 245 attached at right angles to the plate |03. Headed fastenings 246 attached to catchcontrolling bars 243 and 244 (Fig. 16) pass through slots 241 provided in the rear frame plate 245. Journaled between the two catch-controlling bars 243 and 244, on the outer face of the rear frame plate at 248, is a rocking cross beam 248 carrying at its opposite ends the pins 250 which engage the catch-controlling bars 243 and 244. The pins 250 project through the elongated slots 25| provided in the rear frame plate 245. By means of this rocking cross beam 248 the two catch-controlling bars 243 and 244 are positively interconnected so that when the one is moved downwardly the other is moved upwardly correspondingly. 'I'he rocking cross beam 248 is held at both end positions. For this purpose, the pointed end 252 of the rocking cross beam 248 cooperates with the gable-shaped extension 253 provided on a keeper 254 pivoted at 255 to the rear frame plate 245, and 
' acted upon by a spring 256. 
 Each catch-controlling bar 243 and 244 is provided With a recess 251. Extending into the recess 251 of the catch-controlling -bar 243 is one arm 258 of a bellcrank lever having another arm 259. The bellcrank lever 258, 259 is mounted to rock on a cross rod |32. and is connected with the lever arm |30 (Fig. 11). Engaging in the recess 251 of the catch-controlling bar 244 is an arm 260 of a similarly supported bellcrank lever having another arm 28| and the bellcrank lever is connected to the lever |35. 
 As the lower ends of the key stems 98 extend into the range of the respective parallel motion bars |22 and |23, on pressing a key 91 the lower end of the corresponding key stem contacts with the parallel motion bar |22 or |23 and carries it into the position shown in Fis. 10 or Fis. 11. 'I'his causes the latch-releasing lever |42 and its coupling hook |48 to be swung downwardly to release the latch I|| restraining the differential bar |81 whereupon the spring ill advances the differential bar into a position determined by the particular cross extension |88 on the depressed key stem. 
Means to automatically shift the multiplicand denominationaily relatively to the multiplier Since, in certain cases, on pressing the multiplier keys "0 or "9" (such as on'- pressing the 0 key, when shortened multiplication was not used in computing the preceding denominational position, and on -pressing the "9 key when shortened multiplication was used relative to the preceding denominational position) an advance is to be made of one denominational position, the following arrangement is provided. 
 The parallel motion bars |22 and |28 (see also Fiss. and 18) are provided, in the range of the key stems carrying the 0 and 9 keys, with offset portions 282, so that the key stems can pass by the parallel motion bars |22 and |28 freely. Disposed in the range of these two key stems for the keys "0" and "9 are the companion tongues 288 and 284 (see also Fig. 14). 
 These two tongues are respectively pivoted at 288 in spaced relation on a rocking plate 288 which is, in turn, pivoted at 281 on a vertically sliding plate 288. 'I'he two lateral extreme positions of the rocking plate 288 are determined by a pin 288 mounted on the vertically sliding plate 288 and this pin 288 extends into a rectangular recess 218 of the rocking plate 288. 
 The sliding plate 288 is vertically slidable on a base plate 212 attached by screws 21| to the lower key board plate |8| (see also Figs. '7, 13). For this purpose, the screws 218, which are attached to the vertically sliding plate 288 extend through corresponding slots 214 provided in stationary, depending base plate 212. Extending also also through the lower guide slot 214 is the pin 215 attached to the vertically shiftable slide 288, with which pin 218 there is'engaged a traction spring 218 which is attached at the other end to the pin 211 provided on the stationary base plate 212. 
 Connecting the free lower ends of the tongues 288 and 284 is the common traction spring 801 which tends to apply the pins 288 attached to Said tOIlgues against the lower edge of the rocking plate 288 (see Fig. 15). The upper ends of tongues 288 and 284 are provided with shoulders 28| which extend alternately within the range of the key stems coordinated therewith. In the position shown in Fig. 14, which corresponds to the initial position according to Figs. 1 and 7, the shoulder 28| ot the tongue 288 is in the range of the key stem 88 carrying the "0 key. 
 The substantially triangular rocking plate 288 is provided on` its opposite side edges, in the manner shown in Figs. 14 and 15, with projecting inclined surfaces 888. When the rocking plate 288 is in the position shown in Fig. 14 andthe parallel motion bar |22 is moved downwardly by depression of multiplier keyl such bar moves freely over the corresponding inclined edge 888. On the other hand. i1' the companion parallel motion bar |28 is moved downwardly by depression oi' a multiplier key, it engages with the opposltely projecting inclined surface 888 and rocks the plate 288 into the position shown in Fig. 15. It is to be noted, in this regard, that the rocking plate 288 is frictionally mounted on the vertically sliding plate 288 in such manner that the rocking plate 288 remains in the position to which it is shifted by the parallel motion bar |28.- 
 When the rocking plate 28,8 is in the position shown in Fig. 15 and upon a succeeding depression of a multiplier key, the parallel motion bar |28 is moved downwardly, such bar moves freely over the juxtaposed surface 888. On the other hand if, in this position of the rocking plate 288, the parallel motion bar |22 is moved downwardly, the rocking plate 288 is swung back into the position shown in Fig. 14. It is clear from this, that the position, at any time, of rocking plate 288 depends upon which of the twoparaliel motion bars |22 or |28 was last moved downwardly. The particular position of rocking plate 288 determines whether the shoulder 28| oi.' tongue 288 is moved within range of the stem carrying the l0 key or whether the shoulder 28| of tongue 284 lies within range of the "9" key stem. 
 Therefore, if the parallel motion bar |22 was last depressed, the members 288, 288, 284 will assume the positions shown in Fig. 14, and if the parallel motion bar |28 was last depressed, they will assume the positions shown in Fig. 15. When the said parts are in the positions shown in Fig. 14. then, if the "9" multiplier key is depressed, the vertically sliding plate 288 is not moved. On the other hand, if the said parts (288. 288, 284) were in the positions shown in Fig. l5, the vertically sliding plate 288 would be moved and when the "0 key is pressed, the vertically sliding plate 288 is not moved downwardly. 
 As shown in Figs. '1 and 14, the lower edge of the vertically sliding plate 288 overlies the free end 218 of a forwardly extending arm 218 connected to the actuating arm 281 pivoted at 288. 
 A link 818, whose rear end is pivoted to the outer end of the through pin 288 of the actuating arm 281, extends forwardly and is pivoted at 811 to the upper end of a tensioning arm 818 journaled on lthe outer end of a trip shaft 888 extending leftwardly into the adding machine casing beneath the key board thereof. 
 A spring link 882, one end of which is connected at 888 to the tensioning arm 818, is fastened at its opposite end to an arm 88| fast on the trip shaft 888 and normally retains a shoulder 884 of the arm 88| against the spring anchor pin 888. A trip arm 888 fast on the left hand or inner end of the trip shaft, extends upwardly to a point adjacent the arm 88| depending from the "0 adding machine key lever 888 of the "0 key 882. 
 It will be recalled that the "0 adding machine key 882 is eil'ective not only to set a zero stop pin 888, but also to trip the pin carriage escapement (Figs. 3 and 5) by actuation of the escapement tripping bail 428, 421. Hence, counter-clockwise movement oi' the actuating arm 201 either automaticaliy upon restoration of the thrust bar |88 and its dog 2|4 (Fig. 6) while the latter is engaged with the actuating slide 888, having the slot 288 accommodating the through pin 288, or manually, by pressure on the multiplier key "0 or 9 will eilect a one-step advance denominationally of the pin carriage 888. 
 Thus the stems of the multiplier keys "0 or "9" if depressed under the above-explained conditions will contact their individual tongue 283 or 284 to depress the rocking plate 288 and with it the vertically-slidable plate 288 to rock the arm 218 and, through the foregoing connections, shift the tensioning arm 818 to tension the spring link 382 and rock the arm 88| fast on the trip shaft
