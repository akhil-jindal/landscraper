 This invention relates to sequentially controlled multiple clutch mechanisms for use in machines performing a series 01' functions in the making of a product. 
 More particularly the invention is applicable to adding and printing machines, the several mechanisms of which must operate sequentially in timed relation and automatically during the production of a rinted ledger or audit sheet, account and the like. 
 While this result may be obtained in various ways, an object of the present invention is the provision of a series 01' inter-related clutch mechanisms. so arranged that one of such clutch mechanisms, upon operation, shall control or determine when another of the associated clutch mechanisms shall operate, and when it shall cease operation. 
 By this arrangement, the use 01' a special timing device is obviated, the associated clutch mechanisms and their related devices serving in that capacity for the operation of the several mechanical assemblies in the adding and printing machine which are employed in the production work. 
 Another object is the provision of means to sequentially control the operation of a plurality of mechanical assemblies with an economy of time, whereby the operations of the several mechanical assemblies is eflected more rapidly to enable a more speedy completion of the work. 
 A further object is to reduce the load imposed on the driving shaft of the machine, by regulating the sequential control and operation of the several mechanical assemblies for effectm the several functions necessary in the preparation or production of an audit sheet, for example. 
 This object is eflected by providing separate clutch connections between the power, as the main drive shaft, and the respective mechanical assemblies and arranging that the respective clutches through which the power is transmitted to such assemblies shall be efiective only at the proper times, and that after the completion of its work by one assembly, the transmission of power thereto shall cease. 
 Specifically, the several clutches are preferably mounted on a common power shaft, with mechanism including means to trip the clutch system for operation, and means controlled by the clutch system, once it has been tripped, to automatically effect the sequential operations of the respective clutches in timed relation, and the final Germany July 5, 1939 cessation of all clutch action at the completion of each entry in the production of an audit sheet or the like. 
 The invention will be described in connection with an adding and listing accounting machine of the key-set, shaft-operated type, wherein the items of an account may be entered by depressing the appropriate numeral keys, and then depressing a starting key to set the machine in motion. 
 Generally, in entering an item, the first operation is the setting of the diilerentlal members appropriate to the value of the item set up by depressing the numeral keys, to adjustably position the denominational type carriers at the printing line to print the item set up. 
The item may be registered in the totalizer carriers or on the return of the type carriers to their normal idle of accounting machine herein referred to, the 
type carriers must remain in their differentially Secondly, impression means the types remain at the item on the sheet. 
 Thirdly, the differential mechanism, the type carriers and the imrression means are returned by the first-mentioned mechanism to their normal positions. 
 is operated while the printing line, to print to normal. 
 Fifthly, the carrying mechanism must operate prior to the entry of the next item in the totalizer to insure the carrying of ones" into the totalizer wheels oi next higher order. 
In the complete peration of printing and positions. but in that type registering an item in the machine, there are but three which must occur at a particular time, namely, the advance of the differential mechanism, the impression taking, and the restoration of the differential mechanism. 
 The registration 01' the item on the totalizer may occur during the advance or during the return or the diflerential mechanism, and the operation of the carry'may take place after the entry of the amount on the totalizer and prior to the entry of the succeeding item. 
 Indeed, the restoration oi the carrying mechanism may be postponed until the advance of the difierential mechanism pertaining to the entry of such succeeding item. 
 It is essential, however, that the imprint of the item be effected at the time the types are positioned at the printing line, but advantage can be taken of the variables to lessen the time required in printing and registering successive items. 
 Because the cyclic sequence of operation of the multiple clutch mechanisms has been particularly designed for use in an accounting machine, it is believed that the advantages and novelties or the invention can be best appreciated by explanation in connection with such a machine. 
 The invention will be better understood by reference to the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings showing by way ot-example and schematically some embodiments of the invention and in which- Flg. 1 is a perspective view 01 an adding machine, as viewed from the left front, having the invention applied thereto.

General description of the machine The adding and printing accounting machine, to which the invention is applied, includes a frame I, only partly shown on Fig. 5, which supports the operating parts and is concealed by a coverplate 2 (Fig. 1). On the left side of the machine the motor is located which is likewise concealed by the coverplate 2 and is not shown on the illustration. On the same side are located the value keys 3 of a ten-key keyboard. Immediately to the right of this keyboard, the starting key 4 has been arranged. On the right side oi the machine there are the difierent operating keys 5. 
 Above the ten-key keyboard an inspection window 5 has been provided through which the respective values introduced into a sliding carriage, not shown on the illustration, by depressing the keys 3, can be checked. Above the inspection window 8, two further inspection windows I and 8 have been provided through which the number wheels 8 arid ill of two totalizers are made visible. 
 A paper carriage [2 runs on the guiding rails ll (only the front rail is visible on Fig. l). A totalizer-supporting rail l3 attached to the paper carriage i2, removably accommodates a number of totalizers l4. 
 Furthermore, in the frame I (Fig. 5) of the machine there is a printing mechanism l5 (Fig. 1) arranged, the types of which are impressed in known manner by means (not shown) through a typewriting ribbon H on a sheet (not shown) supported by the usual platen IS in the paper carriage l2. The ribbon I! can be wound on. and unwound from, the two reels l8, respectively. The platen l6 can be suitably adjusted by means of the two turn-knobs '8. 
 The present invention relates to the sequential control of the driving clutch 2|) (Fig. 5), the tens-shift clutch 2| and the printing-mechanism clutch 22, all being operable automatically under control of each other. Since these three clutches are essentially the same in design and construction, it is intended to further explain hereafter only the driving clutch 20. 
Detm'ted description of the driving clutch A main drive Shaft 25 (Figs. 5 and 8-10) extends transversely across the machine and is rotatably supported in the opposite side walls 16 of the machine (one only being shown) and in the intermediate partitions 23 and 24 of the frame I. 
 The driving clutch 20, the carry or tens-transfer clutch 2| and the printer operating clutch 22 are all supported on the drive shaft 25. 
 As already mentioned under the heading General description of the machine." it is intended hereafter only to explain the detailed construction of the driving clutch, the construction of the tens-shift clutch 2| and the printing-mechanism clutch 22 being identical. 
 Mounted for rotation on the main driving shaft 25 is a gear wheel 26 (Figs. 2 to 4). 0n the left side of this gear wheel a semi-circular segmental rib 21 is formed, opposed to and complementing which are two quadrantal ribs 28 and 23:: about half as thick as the segment 21, the segments arranged in a circle with their adjacent ends spaced apart. A groove 29 is cut into the segments 28 and 28a as well as in the gear wheel 26 along a chord normal to the center of the gear wheel. A semi-circular clutch pawl 33 rests and slides upon the two spaced quadrantal segments 28 and 23a, the clutch pawl covering the groove 29. The combined thicknesses of the body portions 38 of the clutch pawl 33 and of th quadrantal segments 23, 23a, are equal to the thickness of the semi-circular segment 21, so as to present an outer plane surface. The opposite ends 34 and 35 of the clutch pawl 33 are of a thickness equal to that of the semicircular segment 21, such ends 34 and 35 fitting and sliding in the openings 36 and 31 formed between the opposite opposed ends of the semicircular segment 21 and the quadrantal segments 23 and 23a, respectively, to guide the clutch pawl in its movement relatively to the gear wheel 26. A spring 3| anchored at 32 to the clutch pawl 33 and to a pin 30 located in the chordal groove 29 of the gear wheel 26, tends to hold the clutch pawl 33 at one limit of its travel. The anchor pin 32 on the clutch is of sumcient length to extend into the groove 23 to assist in guiding the pawlin its movement. 
 Additionally, the semi-circular clutch pawl 33 is provided with a thickened portion 390. intermediate its opposite ends, which thickened portion is narrower than the opening 42 between the opposed ends of the two quadrantal segments 28 and 28a in which it is accommodated, to serve as a stop to limit the travel of the clutch pawl in a direction parallel with the chordal groove 23. 
 Furthermore, the thickened portion 390. is extended radially outward from the pawl 33 to form a tooth 39 with which clutch control levers 40 and 4| (Fig. 8) co-act. 
 Within the circular recess 43 (Fig. 4) formed by the circular segments 21. 23 and 23a (Figs. 2, 3 and 4) there is a clutch disk 44 arranged in fixed position on the main driving shaft 25 by the lug 45. The clutch disk 44 has a recess 45 engageable by the lug 33a of the clutch pawl 33. The clutch pawl 33 and the clutch disk 44 are prevented from being displaced by a cover-disk 41 fastened to the circular segment 21 by the screws 48. 
 Operating manner of the driving clutch When depressing the starting key 4, the clutch lever 45 ls moved clockwise (Fig. 8) and the tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33 is released by the his 49 of the clutch lever 4|]. Furthermore by depressing the starting key 4, the motor which is not shown on the illustration. is started, causing the driving shaft 25 to rotate the clutch disk 44 (Fig. 4) on which the clutch pawl lug 33a bears. As soon as the recess 46 of the clutch disk 44 has reached a point below the lug 33a of the clutch pawl 33, the spring 3| will shift the clutch pawl to snap the lug 33a into the recess 46 of the clutch disk 44, the feet 34 and 35 of the clutch pawl 33 sliding in the recesses 36 and 31. The movement of the clutch pawl in the direction of arrow 50 (Fig. 2), is stopped by the lower edge 5| 0! the guide foot 390. of the clutch pawl 33 striking against the edge 52 (Fig. 2) of the recess 42 formed between the circular segments 23 and 23a. 
 After the clutch pawl 33 and the drive ring 44 have thus become connected, the gear 25, being a part of the clutch, rotates with the driving shaft 25. After half a turn of the driving clutch 2|), the tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33 strikes against the upper end of arm 9 of the clutch control lever 4| (Fig. 10) lying in the path of the tooth 39. In consequence of this the clutch pawl 33 (Fig. 4) is arrested, while the drive shaft 25 and its clutch ring 44 continue to rotate. The clutch gear 25 also advances slightly relatively to the arrested clutch pawl 33 due to its momentum, to tension the clutch pawl spring 3| and to disengage the clutch pawl lug 33a from the recess 46 in the clutch driving ring 44. The upper edge of the guide foot 33a of the clutch pawl contacts the end 53 of the quadrantal segment 23 to arrest the relative movement between the gear wheel 25 and the clutch pawl. When the auxiliary clutch control lever 4| is moved in anti-clockwise direction (Fig. 10), it releases the tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33, whereby the connection 46, 33a is resumed in the above-described manner and the driving clutch 20 is again rotated by the driving shaft 25. The disengagement of the driving clutch 20 from the driving shaft 25 is again effected, as described, after another halfturn, through the action of the driving clutch control lever 43, whereupon the driving clutch 20, having performed a complete revolution of 360 assumes its rest position again, as shown in Fig. 8. 
Detailed description of the operating parts of the driving clutch, tens-shift clutch and printing mechanism clutch The key stem 54 of the starting key 4 (Figs. 6, 8, 9, 10) slides vertically in the coverplate 55 and the bottom-plate 56 of a key frame which is not shown in the illustration. The key stem 54 has at its lower end an offset projection 51 (Fig. 6) encircled by a sprin 58 that tensions a lug 59 formed on the stem against the underside of the coverplate 55 of the key frame and holds the key in normal position. 
 A non-revolving rod 6| is supported by the bracket 50 which is flanged to the bottom plate 56 of the key frame, and by the right side-wall 16 of the frame I. An extended wing 62 is journaled on this shaft 5|, as shown in Fig. 6, and. by the action of a coiled sprin 63 (Fig. 5) the wing is urged clockwise (Fig. 8) around the rod 5|. In its normal position the free edge of the wing 62 lies at an angle against the lower edge 54 of the key stem 54. The wing 62 carries an arresting lip (Fig. 6), the upward y projecting free end 65 of which normally lies in the path of a finger 51 projecting from the slide 00. The slide 68 (Figs 6, 8, 10) is guided through a slot 89 (Fig. 6) in an angle piece I fixed to the bottom plate of the machine frame and can be actuated in both directions of the arrow II as well as around its fulcrum I2. A spring I3 fastened to the pin 14 of the slide 58 and to the lower extension of the angle piece I0, tends to hold the slide 68 against the lower edge of the slot 03 of the angle piece I0, when in normal position. A horn 15 (Figs. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11) projects upwardly from the slide 58 at a point where the slide passes beneath the clutch mechanism. 
 A shaft TI (Figs. 5, 6, 8, 9, l0, 11) is journaled at its opposite ends in the right side wall I6 (Fig. and the left side-wall (not shown in the illustration) of the machine frame I. This shaft 11 has a. U-shaped yoke I8 pivoted thereon. The yoke 10 is moved clockwise by the action of the spring 10 attached at one end to the lower extension 80 of the yoke I8 (Fig. 11) and on the other end to the backwail 8i (Figs. 8, 9, 10) of the machine frame I. The normal position of the yoke I0 is determined by contact of the roller 83, on an arm 82 of the yoke lever I0 with a cam 04 fixed to a gear 05 fast on a. rotatable shaft 05 extending transversely of the machine and Journaled in the partition walls 23 and 91, and in the left-hand side frame, not shown. 
 The gear 05 meshes with the gear 25. In both lower extensions and 81 (Fig. 11) of the yoke I0 there is a pin 00 (Figs. 6, 8, 9, l0, 11) having a U-shaped locking pawl 80 pivoted thereon. A spring 30 is fastened at one end to the tail 00a. Fig. 11, of the pawl 09 and at the other end to the projection SI of the leg 00 of the yoke Hi to normally tension the pawl clockwise around pin 00. The normal position of the pawl 89 is determined by contact of the offset tooth 02 of one arm of the locking pawl 89 against the shoulder 93a, Fig. 8, of an arm 54 of the clutch control lever 40, such clutch control lever being designed in U-shape and fast on the shaft I1. The vertically extending arm of the U-shaped locking pawl 85 is provided with an off-set ear 95, Fig. 11, which lies in the path of the upwardly projecting born 15 of the slide 50. The clutch control lever 00 is fastened to the shaft II by a bolt 86 and is capable of cooperating by the lug 49 of its upwardly extending arm with the tooth 30 of the clutch pawl 33 of the driving clutch. 
 An angular back lash preventing detent 03 (Figs. 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10) is pivoted at 98 to a par-- tition Wall 91, a spring I00 anchored at I02, operating to rock the detent clockwise against a stop pin I03 projecting from the wall 01. The rearwardly extending arm of the detent 90 is capable of cooperating with the studs I04 and I 040 projecting at diametrically opposite points from the face of the gear 85. A bar I05 is fixed rigidly in the right sidewall I6, Fig. 5. and in the left sidewall, not shown, of the machir 2 frame I. A U-shaped member I00, Fig. 7, is mounted for rotation on the bar I05. A spring I01 fastened at one end to the downwardly extending leg I08 of the U-shaped member I00 and at its other end to the backwali ill of the machine frame I normally tensions the member I05 clockwise around the bar I05. The normal position of the U-shaped member is determined by contact of a roller I09 carried by one arm of the bail member I06 with a cam H0 mounted on the printing mechanism clutch 22, Figs. 5, l4 and 15, thus placing the restoration of the main drive clutch Printin An an- H2 is pivoted at its angle at of the downwardly extending arm III of the U-shaped member I06. The slide 00 is pivotally connected at I2 to pawl H2. The offset tooth II! of the pawl H2 is capable of cooperating with the foot II5 of a downwardly extending leg I it of the U-shaped auxiliary clutch control lever II effective to temporarily arrest the drive clutch 20 at the end of a half revolution, whereby to mom time for the operation of the printing clutch. The remaining clutches make complete revolutions without interruption and hence, are not provided with auxiliary clutch control levers to arrest them prior to the completionsof their cycles. A spring H0 is attached at one end to the opposed downwardly extending leg I II of the auxiliary clutch control lever II, and at the other end to the backwall 0| of the machine frame I. Th auxiliary clutch control lever I is moved clockwise around the shaft I05 by the action of the spring H0. The normal position of the clutch lever H is determined by contact of the shoulder Ilia of the foot II! of the leg H0 or the auxiliary clutch 0| with the offset tooth I of the pawl II2. In this normal position of the auxiliary clutch control lever II the arm H0 lies outside of the path of the projection 30 of the clutch pawl 33 of the driving clutch 20. 
 The auxiliary clutch control lever I has a stop projection I20 capable of engaging with a stop rod I2I which is fastened in the intermediary wall 24 and in the left sidewall, not shown, of the machine frame I. 
 A pawl I23 is pivoted on an upwardly extending arm I22 of the clutch auxiliary clutch control lever ll at I20 and is formed with a node to cooperate with a stud I26. Figs. 8, 9, and 10, fixed to the face of the gear 20 ofthe driving clutch 20.. A pin I20 extending through a slot I21, Fig. '7, of the pawl I23 is secured to an upwardly extending arm I20 of a bail-like printer clutch control lever I30 journaled on the shaft I05, as shown in Fig. 7. A spring I32, Figs. 7, 14, 15, and 16, is fastened to a depending leg I3I of the printer clutch control lever I30 and anchored to the backwall BI of the machine frame I for rocking the printer clutch control lever I30 clockwise around the shaft I05. The normal position of the printer clutch control lever I30 is determined by contact or the forwardly extending stop projection I33 of the printer clutch control lever against the stop bar I2I. In this normal position the control arm I34 of the printer clutch control lever I30 lies in the path of the tooth I35 of a clutch pawl, not shown, which is installed in the printing-mechanism clutch 22. 
 A yoke-shaped back-lash preventing detent I30, Figs. 7, l4 and 15, is mounted to swing on the shaft I05. A spring I30 is fastened at one end to the rearwardly extending arm I31 of the detent and at the other end to a pin I39 fastened in the rear-wall III of the machine frame I. This spring I30 causes the detent I36 to swing around the shaft I05 anti-clockwise. The normal position of the back-lash preventing detent I35 is determined by contact of the forward extension I40 of the detent I06 with the stop bar MI. The surface III of the arm I42 of the detent I36 engages with a roller I43 (Figs. 14-16) attached to the printing-mechanism clutch 22. 
 A modified form of detent I30 is shown in Fig. 16, which differs from that shown in Fig. 15

The ball I15 is pivotallylnounted at m to'the n ghaharid sidewall", and at its opposite end the bail m' is provided with an angular arm I 11 pivotal1y supported on a rod I86 mounted in a bracket I18 secured at I18 (Fig. 8) to the machine frame. A laterally extending pin I8I mounted in the free :Iald of the arm I11, projects beneath the slide A spring I82 (Fig. 6) connected to the link I13 at I83 and anchored to the side frame at I84 tends to rock the shaft 11 with the drive clutch control lever 46 thereon in clockwise direction to cause the drive clutch control lever 46 to free the drive clutch 26 for operation. 
 Also spring I82 tends to rock the bail I15 clockwise to press the pin I6I of the left hand bail supporting arm I11 upwardly against the bottom edge of the slide 68 to rock the projecting finger 61 at the front end of the slide, out of engagement with the arresting lip of the wing 62 controlled by the starting key 4. 
 The drive clutch control lever 46 and the bail arm I11 with its pin. I8I are held against such operation, however, by contact of the shoulder 83a of the depending arm 84 of the drive clutch control lever 46 with the laterally extending ing 32 of the locking pawl 88 pivotally mounted in the yoke-shaped rocking member 18, said looking pawl being held etlective by its spring 86, and by the upstanding horn 16 of the slid 68 which determines the normal position of the locking pawl 88 Furthermore, the yoke-shaped rocking member 18 journaled on the shaft 11 is rockable clockwise by its spring 19, but is held in normal position. by contact of its arm 82 with the clutchdriven cam 84. thus normally affording a fixed fulcrum for the locking pawl. 
Ope ation of the driving clutch, the tens-shift clutch and the printing-mechanism clutch When depressing the motor key 4, Figs. 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, the key stem 54 is moved downward against the action of spring 68. During this operation, the lower end 64 of the key stem 54 engages the ball 62. Consequently, the bail 62 is moved anti-clockwise, Fig. 9, around the rod 6I against the tension of the torsion spring 68. The'arresting lip 65 mounted on the bail 62, during the movement of the bail 62 engages with its lug 66 the projecting finger 61 of the slide 68 which is thus slid-rearwardly in the direction of arrow 1I against the tension of the spring 13. During this operation, the horn 15, Figs. 6, 8 and 11, attached to the slide 68, engages the lug of the vertically extending arm of the locking pawl 88. to rock the locking pawl anticlockwise, Fig. 11, against the tension of the spring 86. When the pawl 88 is moved anticlockwise, the lug 82 of the pawl 88 releases the shoulder 83a on the depending arm 84 of the drive clutch control lever 46 rigidly mounted on the shaft 11. Thereupon the spring I82 fastened to the link I13. Fig, 6, operates the drive clutch control lever 46 in clockwise direction by the crank I12 and the shaft 11. During this operation the lug 48, Fig. 8, of the drive clutch lever 46 releases the tooth 38 of the clutch pawl 33 installed in the driving clutch 26, whereupon spring 3i (Fig. 4) engages the clutch pawl with the driving ring 44 to connect the driving clutch 26 with the driving shaft 25, as has already been described under the heading Operation of the driving clutch," so that the driving clutch 26, 
after a contact (not shown) has been closed, will take part in the revolution of the driving shaft. 
 The shaft I1 and the crank I12 rigidly mounted thereon, when rocked clockwise by the spring I92, shift the link I19, (Fig. 6) against the direction of arrow II, whereby the bail I15 is moved clockwise around its pivot I15 and the rod I89 to cause the pin IiII of the bail member I'I5 to raise the slide 98 from below so that the rear end of the slide 99 is rocked counter-clockwise on its pivoted connection I2 with the looking pawl II2 for the auxiliary clutch control lever 4|, against the tension of the spring I3. During this movement the forwardly projecting finger 61 of the slide 69 is raised above the arresting lip 85 of the ball 62, whereby the connection from the motor key 4 to the driving clutch 29 is broken. Should the motor key 4 again be depressed or be kept in depressed condition, a second release of the driving clutch 29 during the calculating operation is impossible, since the projecting finger of the slide 69 is now held above the path of the arresting lip 55 by the pin IIII of arm III of the bail I15 under the influence of the spring I82. After the motor key 4 has been released by the operator, the bail 52 under action of the torsion spring 63 and the motor key 4 under action of the spring 59 will resume their positions of rest shown in Fig. 8 during which the normal position of the motor key 4 is fixed by the lug 59 of the key stem 54 striking against the underside of coverplate 55. 
 When the slide 59 is moved in the direction of arrow II, the pawl II2, Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which normally locks the auxiliary drive clutch control lever 49 in its idle position, is moved clockwise around the pivot "3 from the position shown in Fig. 8 into the position shown in Fig. 9. During this operation. the lug I ll of the locking pawl II2 releases the shoulder iii of the arm IIB, Fig. 7, of the U-shaped auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4|. so that this lever 4| is moved clockwise around the shaft I95 by the tension of the spring II8. The movement of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4| is stopped by the arm I29 striking against the stop rod I2I. By the clockwise movement of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4| the lug N4 of the locking pawl II 2 strikes against the surface II 5a, Fig. 7, of the foot N5 of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4| from below. Fig. 9. During the movement of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4|, its control arm H9 is brought into the path of the tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33 of the driving clutch 29. 
 During the clockwise movement of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4|, Fig. 7, around the shaft I95, the tappet I23 pivotally mounted on the upwardly extending arm I22 is also moved anticlockwise relatively to the pin I29 oi the arm I29 of the printer clutch control lever I39, which pin now acts as a fulcrum causing the lug I25 of the tappet i23 to move into the path of the stud I26, Fig. 9, of the driving clutch to enable the driving clutch to trip the printer clutch control lever I39 for operation at a predetermined time in the operation of the driving clutch. By the clockwise movement of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 4|, the slotted locking arm I62 is rotated clockwise on the stop rod I2I by the pin I55, Fig. '7, of the depending leg Ill of the auxiliary driving clutch control lever 49 to interpose the shoulder I63 of the slotted locking arm I62 in front of the edge I51 of the tens carrying clutch control V lever I53, Fig. 13, mounted for rotation on the shaft I95 and controlling the tensshift clutch 2|, Fig. 5. 
 As soon as the driving clutch 29 starts turning in the direction of arrow I95, Fig. 8, at 0, Fig. 1'7, its gear 29 turns the gear in the direction of arrow I95. The cam 94 rigidly mounted on the gear partakes in this movement and presents its reduced circumference I39 (Fig. 6) to the roller 93 carried on the arm 82, Fig. 6, of the U- shaped rocker I8. The spring I9 is thus permitted to swing the rocker I8 and the locking pawl 99 clockwise, during which movement, the onset lug 92 Of the locking pawl 19. which, it will be remembered, after release from the shoulder 93a of thedepending drive clutch control lever arm 94, lies on the hooked edge I99 of the lever arm 94 (Fig. 9), is drawn rearwardly until its offset lu 92 drops of! the shoulder 93a to lie on the edge 93 of the depending arm 94 behind the shoulder 930. 
 As the driving clutch 29 approaches the end of the first half revolution, the rocker member 19 lies at its extreme clockwise limit of travel with the roll 93 of the rocker in contact with the lower concentric circumference of the cam 84 indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 10. At this point in the operation, the normally idle auxiliary drive clutch control'lever- 4| is in its eflective position to arrest the drive clutch 29 at the end of the first halfrevolution of the clutch. said clutch control lever 4| having been released for effective operation by depression of the starting key 4, and the drive clutch control lever 49 remains in its tripped position to release the drive clutch 29 for operation. 
 However, the locking pawl I I2 for normally retaining the auxiliary drive clutch control lever 4| in idle position, lies in contact with the sole of the foot II5 of the arm IIG of the auxiliary clutch control lever 4| in readiness to lock the clutch control lever in its idle position, as soon as such clutch control lever is restored to its idle position, and the lug 92 of locking pawl 89 lies behind the shoulder 93a of the depending arm 94 of the drive clutch control lever 49 in readiness to rock said drive clutch control lever 49 to position to interrupt the clutch action of drive clutch 29 at the end of a complete revolution, as soon as the cam 84, on the second half revolution of the drive clutch, swings the rocker back to normal position. 
 Returning now to the beginning of the operation, when the gear 95, Fig. 8, starts turning in the direction of arrow I95, the stud I94 mounted on the gear 85 will withdraw from the abutting end I99 of the back-lash preventing detent 99. whilst the depending arm of the detent 99 under action of the spring I99 engages a pin I93 and remains in its normal position shown in Fig. 8. 
 Shortly before a half-turn of the gear 95 has been completed, the stud I94a mounted on the face of gear 95 diametrically opposite the stud I94, engages the edge I9I of the detent 99 turning it anti-clockwise around its pivot 99 against the action of the spring I99 until the stud I94a slides over the edge I92 of the detent 99. Under the tension of the spring I99, the detent 99 Is moved clockwise again around the pin 99 and the surface I99 of the detent 99 now lies against the stud I94a oi the gear 95, whereby the driving clutch 29 is prevented from turning back against the direction of arrow I99 of the clutch pawl 33 installed in the driving clutch 29, under the action of the clutch pawl sprin 3| (Fig. 4). 
 Before the driving clutch 29 has completed its first half-turn, a stud I41 attached to the driving clutch 29, Figs. 8, 9, 10, will engage the edge I93, Figs, 12 and 13, of the arm I48 0! the U- shaped tensiening bail member I", Figs. 7 and 7a, whereby the member I4! is moved anti-clockwise around the shaft Illl against the spring I5I. When the driving clutch 26 has completed its first half-turn of 180", Fig. 1'1, the stud I41 of the driving clutch passes into the recess I94 of the arm I48 of the U-shaped tensioning member I49 and holds the latter in its shifted position. When the U-shaped tensioning member I49 has been moved anti-clockwise, the spring I55, which is fastened on one end to the pin I 55 of the arm I56 of the U-shaped tensioning member I49 and on the other end is attached to a pin I54 01' the tenscarrying clutch control lever I53, is expanded since, as has been described, the tens-carrying clutch control lever I53 cannot be influenced by the spring I55 owing to the interpositioning of the shoulder I63 (Fig. 7i cf the slotted arm I62 in its path. The tension stored in spring I 55 by the operation of the drive clutch 2|! is later utilized to trip the tens-carrying clutch Z I Shortly before the first half-turn of the driving clutch 23 has been completed, the pin I26. Fig. 9. which is fastened on the gear 26, will engage the node I25 of the tappet I23, moving the latter clockwise around the pivot I24. Such clockwise rotation of the tappet causes it, by means of the slot and pin connection I21, I29 Fig. 7) with the upstanding arm I29 of the printer clutch control bail lever I36, to rock said bail rearwardly (counter-clockwise) against the tension of the spring I32 and displace the control arm I34 from engagement with the printer clutch pawl I35 to free the printer clutch 12 for operation, as shown in Fig. 15. 
 Therefore, the printer clutch 22, tripped by the drive clutch stud I28, starts to operate just as the drive clutch 20 about completes its first half revolution. Simultaneously the tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33 of the driving clutch 20 strikes against the auxiliary clutch lever control arm H9, Fig. 10, of the auxiliary clutch lever 4i, whereby the driving clutch 23 is disengaged from the driving shaft 25, as has been described under the heading Operation of the driving clutch." and the driving clutch comes to a stop after a turn of 180, Fig, 17. 
 The cam IIII, Figs. 14 and 15, also partakes in the movement of the printing-mechanism clutch 22 to which it is rigidly fastened to first position the drop I95 of the cam III! opposite the roll I09 of the lock-controlling bail or member I06, in order to enable the printer clutch to effect the printing operation while the types I not shown) are still in printing position. Simultaneously with the presentation of the drop I95 to the roller I09, Fig. '7, of the U-shaped lock-controlling member I05, the roll drops down to the low point of the cam IID to enable the U-shaped lock-controllin member I66, Fig. 6, under the action of the spring I61 to rock clockwise around the shaft I05 from the position shown in Fig. 9 into the position shown in Fig. 10. 
 During the clockwise movement of the U- shaped lock-controlling member I06, the lug IIfl of the locking pawl II2 slides rearwardly along the bottom of the foot II5 of the auxiliary clutch control lever until under the action of the spring 13, which is fastened to the slide 68. the lug IN or the locking pawl H2 snaps behind the shoulder II5a of the auxiliary clutch control lever 4|. Fig. 10. 
 Obviously, lock controlling member I06, on such clockwise rotation. withdraws the locking pawl II2 bodily towards the rear of the machine, drawing with it the slide 68 connected thereto. 
in the direction of 'arrow II. Simultaneously the horn 15 of the slide 58 engages again the ea; 95 of the locking pawl 39 for the drive clutch control lever 46 and rocks the locking pawl counterclockwise around the pin 88 against the spring 36 from the position shown in Fig. 9 into the position shown in Fig. 10, wherein the locking pawl lies out of the path of the drive clutch control lever 40, and said lever 40 lies in idle position. 
 Shortly before the printing-mechanism clutch 22 completes its revolution, the back lash preventing roller I43 on the printing-mechanism clutch 22, Figs. 14 and 15, engages the edge I91 of the multiple armed back lash preventing detent I36, Fig. '7, to rock it clockwise around the shaft I05 against the spring I38. As soon as the roller N3 of the printing-mechanism clutch 22 slides over the edge I93 of the arm I22 of the back-lash preventing detent I36, the latter is turned counterclockwise around the shaft I05 by the action of the spring I33. Simultaneously the surface I4I, Fig. 14, of the back-lash preventing detent I36 engages the roller I43 of the printing-mechanism clutch 22 and holds it in the position of rest shown in Fig. 14. Reverse rotation of the printing-mechanism clutch 22 under the action of the spring, not shown. which is fastened to the clutch pawl of the printing-mechanism clutch 22. in the same manner as is spring 3| (Fig. 4) of the drive clutch 20, is therefore prevented. 
 Approximately after a half-turn of the printing mechanism clutch 22 and of the cam IIEI, the U-shaped locking pawl carrier I08, Figs. 6 and 7, is rocked anti-clockwise around the shaft I05 by the cam IIII, Fig. 14, and against the spring I31. During the second half-revolution of the printer-clutch 22, therefore, the lug H4, Fig. 8, of the auxiliary locking pawl II2 engages the shoulder Ili of the auxiliary clutch control lever 4| of the driving clutch. whereby the auxiliary clutch control lever 4| is moved anti-clockwise around the shaft IIl5 against the action of the spring II8 to displace the control arm II9 of the auxiliary clutch control lever 4| from the path of the clutch pawl tooth 39 to free the drive clutch 2|] so that it can make its second half revolution. 
 Thus the printer cam 22 controls the operation of the drive clutch 20 at this point in the rotation of the latter. 
 Counter-clockwise rotation of the bail I05 advances the slide 68, the lower edge of which rides over the stud IBI of the bail I15 which remains in its set position, so that the slide advances at an ascending angle. When the slide 68 is moved against the direction of arrow H, the horn 75, Fig. 6, of the slide 63 releases th car 95 of the locking pawl 89. Consequently the pawl 89 is free to move clockwise around the pin 88 under the action of the spring 90 from the position shown in Fig. 10 into the position shown in Fig. 8 with respect to the shoulder 93a of the driving clutch control lever 40 to latch it in position to disconnect the clutch at the end of its second half revolution. 
 During the anti-clockwise movement of the auxiliary drive clutch control lever 4I. resulting in the release of the drive clutch 20 for its second half revolution. the upwardly extending arm I22 of the auxiliary clutch control lever I is rocked to swing its tappet I23 and withdraw its node I25 from the path of the stud I25 projecting from the face of the gear 26, as shown in Fig. 10, to the position shown in Fig. 9. 
 This shift of the tappet I23 is occasioned by the combined counter-clockwise action of the arm I22 of the auxiliary clutch control lever II and of the spring-driven clockwise return to effective position of the arm I29 of printer clutch control lever I30,which arm carries the pin I26 accommodated in the slot I21 in the tappet. 
 Furthermore, during such anti-clockwise movement of the auxiliary drive clutch control lever ll of the pin I65,'Figs. 7 and 7a, which is attached to the arm ill of the auxiliary drive clutch control lever I, bears on the lower edge I96, Fig. 13, of the slot IE4 of the arm I62 to rock the arm I62 anti-clockwise around the stop rod I2I. As a result, the shoulder I63 of the arm I62 releases the edge I51 of the tens-carrying clutch control lever I53 of the tens-shift clutch 2| and at that moment the tens-carrying clutch control lever I63 is moved anti-clockwise around the shaft I05 by the action of the spring I55 which has been tensioned by the U-shaped tensioning member I49. Owing to the movement of the clutch lever I53, its control arm I60 releases a clutch pawl, not shown, which is arranged in the tens-shift clutch 2i, so that both the tens-shift clutch 2i and the driving clutch 20 participate in the movement of the driving shaft 26. 
 During the second half-revolution of the driving clutch its cam 66 is rotated in the direction of arrow I06 by means of the gears 26, 65, Fig. 8, to cause the ascending face I99 of the cam to elevate the roller 09, Fig. 6, of the U-shaped locking pawl carrier 16 to rock the latter, as well as the pawl 69 anti-clockwise around the shaft 11. During this movement the lug 92 of the locking pawl 69 engages the shoulder 93a of the drive clutch control lever 40, Fig. 11, and tends to move such drive clutch control lever in an anticlockwise direction, whereby the lug 49 of the clutch lever 40 is again thrown into the path of tooth 39 of the clutch pawl 33 which is arranged in the driving clutch 20 and thereby causes the driving clutch 20 to be arrested after the second half-turn of 180, Fig. 17. 
 The restoration of the drive clutch control lever 40 to effective position relatively to the drive clutch 20, rocks shaft 11 to which the drive clutch control lever 40 is secured. 
 The gear 65 also participates in the movement of the driving clutch 20 by means of gear 26. Shortly before the second half-turn of the driving clutch 20 as well as of the gear 65 in the direction of arrow I96, has been completed, the 
stud I06 of the gear 65 bears on the edge I9I of the back lash preventing detent 99 and tends to move it anti-clockwise against the spring I00. As soon as the stud I04 slides off the edge I92 of the back lash preventing detent 99. this back lash preventing detent 99 is again moved clockwise by the action of the spring I and the edge I90 oi the back lash preventing detent 09 again come" to lie before the stud I04, Fig. 8. 
 After the second half-turn of the driving clutc. 20 has been completed, the roller 63 of the U-shaped lock pawl carrying member 16 lies again on the raised part oi the cam 66. 
 During the second half-turn of 180, Fig. 17, of the driving clutch 20, the stud I41, Figs. 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13, again releases the arm I40 of the U-shaped tensioning member I49, Fig. 7a, whereby this member I49 is moved clockwise around the shaft I by the action of the spring ISI. 
 Simultaneously the pin I56 fastened to the arm I60 of the U-shaped tensioning member I49 bears on the edge I51 of the tens-carrying clutch control lever I63 to rock the latter in clockwise direction around the shaft I06. During this rocking movement, the arm I60 of the tens-carrying clutch control lever I53 again enters the path 01' the clutch pawl arranged in the tens-shift clutch 2i, which causes the tens-shirt clutch 2i to be arrested after a turn of 360, Fig. 17. 
 During the movement of the U-shaped pawlcarrying yoke-shaped rocking member 16. Figs. 6 and 11, in an anti-clockwise direction, in which also the shaft 11 participates because of the engagement of the lug 92 of the clutch locking and release pawl 69 with the shoulder 93;; on the arm 94 of the clutch disconnecting dog l0, 49, the bail I15 is moved anti-clockwise by means of the crank I12, Fig. 6, and the link I13. Simultaneously the pin I6I of the bail I15 releases the slide 68, so that this slide is drawn downwards around its pivot 12 by the action of the spring 13 to position the front end of the projecting finger 61 in line with the lip 65 of the ball 62. whereby the connection between the motor key 4 and the driving clutch 20 is reestablished. 
 Shortly before the complete rotation of the tens-shift clutch 2|, Figs. 12 and 13, the stud I10 mounted on the gear I61 of the tens-carrying clutch 22 engages the edge 200 of the back lash preventing detent I66 and moves the latter anti-clockwise against the spring I69. As soon as the stud I10 of the gear I61 has moved past the edge 20I of the detent I66, the latter is moved clockwise by the action of the spring I69 to position its end 202 behind the stud I10 of the gear I61, whereby any turning backwards of the tens-shift clutch 2I due to the tension of the clutch pawl spring in the tens-shift clutch 2i is prevented. 
 The apparatus of the present invention has been described in detail with reference to specific embodiments. It is to be understood, however. that the invention is not limited by such specific reference but is broader in scope and capable of other embodiments than those specifically de scribed and illustrated in the drawings.
