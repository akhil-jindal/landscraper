Patented Mar. 4, 1947 SELECTIVE NORMALIZING MECHANISMS FOR CALCULATING MACHINES Harold T. Avery, Oakland, Calif., assignor to Marchant Calculating Machine Company, a corporation of California Application April 7, 1941, Serial No. 387,259 
 27 Claims. 1 
 The present invention relates to calculating machines and has particular reference to machines capable of performing automatic calculations, such as automatic multiplication, wherein a register carriage is automatically shifted from one position to the next during the course of the calculation. The particular embodiment of the invention disclosed herein is adapted to the cornmercially known Marchant calculating machine the general structure of which is disclosed in the Harold T. Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, issued October 1, 1940, and the tabulator mechanism of which is disclosed and claimed in the Avery Patent Number 2,365,324, issued December 19, 1944. Reference is had to the above patents for a complete disclosure of the calculating ma chine including mechanism not specifically disclosed herein. 
 It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not to be regarded as limited to application to machines or mechanism of the type set forth in the above patents. For example, although the invention is shown applied to a machine in which the shiftable carriage supports a register for movement relative to the actuating mechanism for the register, certain features of the invention will also be useful in calculating machines wherein the registers are stationary and the actuating mechanism is shiftable relative to the registers. 
 In calculating machines of the general class disclosed, the dividend and divisor of a division problem, or the multiplier and multiplicand of a multiplication problem are entered into the machine and the register carriage is shifted step by step from one ordinal position to the next during performance of the machine. At the termination of the automatic performance the carriage is in end position or in a position other than its starting position. Thus, in most cases where a repetitive series of calculation performances involving an automatic carriage shift are to be carried out, the carriage must be brought to a starting position at the beginning of each new calculation and the accumulator and/or counter registers must be cleared. 
 Also the selection mechanism, 1. e., the keyboard, in which at least certain factors of the problem to be worked by the machine are set, must be cleared. 
 Heretofore these clearing and carriage reshifting operations have usually been accomplished by individually manipulating appropriate clearing and tabulator or carriage shift keys or the like to return the carriage to a starting position and to clear the selection mechanism and the various registers after each calculation. 
 It is the general object of the present invention to reduce the number of manual operations required after one machine calculation to condition a calculating machine for a subsequent calculation. 
 Another object of the invention is to facilitate selective conditioning of any of a series of independently operable machine conditioning mechanisms to be operated under the control of a master initiating device. 
 Another object is to enable a single manipulable member to render any of a series of machine conditioning mechanisms ineffective to be controlled by a master initiating device. 
 A further object is to selectively render a machine conditioning mechanism ineffective by releasably latching an initiating key therefor in partially depressed condition. 
 A further object is to provide means operable under control of any of a series of tabulator control keys for selectively effecting clearance of a keyboard and/or certain registers. 
 With a machine embodying the present invention it is possible to reduce the amount of time and effort on the part of a machine operator in conditioning a calculating machine for a problem by reducing the number of controls which must be manipulated by the operator. For this purpose, any or all of the various clearing mechanisms, i. e., the accumulator, counter, and keyboard clearing mechanism, may be arranged to be initiated by a master initiating device controlled by a single key, preferably a tabulator shift key. Thus, after depressing a tabular key indicative of a desired starting position of the carriage (upon termination of a calculation) the machine operator may direct his attention merely to the setting up of the next problem in the keyboard and the carriage will be automatically shifted to predetermined starting position while any or all of the clearance mechanisms will be operated to condition the machine to receive the factors of the next problem. 
 The present application also discloses means whereby the operation of the various machine conditioning mechanisms, such as the tabulator and clearance mechanisms, may be automatically initiated at the termination of a division performance; this subject matter being claimed in the Dustin and Avery Patent Number 2,377,767, issued June 5, 1.945.

General construction Since the machine in which the present invention is embodied in its preferred form is disclosed in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent Number 2,216,659 only a brief description of the operation of the same will be included herein. 
 The machine is of the proportional gear selective speed type wherein there is provided a series of gear combinations (not shown) of different gear ratios in each order. The usual banks of keys H10 (Figure 1) are provided, one for each order, to selectively effect connection of one of the gear combinations, depending on the value of a key depressed, to a cyclically operable main clutch 428 (Figure 3) and thereby transmit rotation to a series of ordinally positioned drive gears I89 (Figure 6). During actuation, intermeshing gears 273 and 2' supported on rods 27!] and 272, respectively, carried by the carriage and aligned with the various ordinal gears I89 are entrained with these gears to transmit rotation to accumulator dials 219 forming an accumulator register 3i 8 (Figure 1). As disclosed in the above mentioned Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, tens carry mechanism (not shown) of the duplexing type is provided to efiect tens transfer. 
 The ratios of the various above mentioned gear combinations are such that, for each cycle of operation of the machine, the dials 219 will each be driven at a rate of speed proportionate to the value of the depressed key I00 in line therewith plus an added increment of one tenth of the amount of rotation of the next lower order dial. During subtractive operation, the direction of rotation is opposite to that which is efiected during additive operation, but in either case the speed is the same when the selection is the same. Thus, during each cycle of operation of the main clutch 428 an amount corresponding to the amount set up in the keyboard will be entered additively or subtractively into the accumulator register 3E8 and, through mechanism not shown, the number of cycles of operation of the main clutch in each carriage position will be entered into a counter register I814 also carried by the carriage so that during division the counter register I874 serves to register the quotient of a prob- Engagement of the main clutch is efiected by a setting clutch 430 (Figure 2) keyed on a setting shaft 43 I and adapted to be driven by the driving motor. 
Setting clutch control The setting clutch 430 is engaged through the instrumentality of any of a series of operation control keys such as the division key 970, and the add barBiifl (Figure 1), and when so engaged "effects certain preliminary "operations iii-'- cident to the commencement of a calculation under power of the driving motor (not shown) hesides causing engagement of the main clutch to eflect actuation. 
 The setting clutch is normally held disengaged by a clutch dog 394 (Figure 2) which is keyed on a rockable shaft 501 and is urged clockwise by a spring v52 2 tensioned between the machine frame and the dog so as to urge its rightmost end, as viewed in Figure 2, into its illustrated position wherein it seats in one of a pair of notches formed in the clutch .430 and holds the clutchdisengaged from the motor drive. 
 To permit .operation of the setting clutch by any one of several operation control mechanisms, 9. depressible operating bar 503 is provided which is supported by a parallel link arrangement comprising a lever 504 pivoted to the machine frame at 150.6 and a plate 505 pivoted to the frame at 50.1. A spring 510 tensioned between the machine frame work and the lever 594 normally maintains the bar in its illustrated raised position. A bell crank 512 pivoted to the plate 595 at 5|3 is normally held by means of a tension spring 5H5, extending between the bell crank 512 and the bar 503, in a position wherein a notch formed .on the lower end thereof embraces an ear 515 on the clutch dog 394 so that upon depression of the bar 503 the bell crank 5l2 will rock the dog 394 out of the engaged notch of the setting clutch 430 causing the clutch to rotate the setting shaft 43 I. V 
 Mechanism (not shown) is provided to release the crank -5l2 from the ear 515 during the first cycle of operation of the setting clutch so as to limit this clutch to a single cycle of operation regardless of how long the bar 593 is held dcpressed. 
 Rocking of the setting clutch dog 394 effects closing of the motor circuit by virtue of engagement thereof with an ear 409 (Figure 5) formed on a lever 396 pinned to a shaft 386. The shaft 386 has a lever 391 pinned thereto (see Figure 22) which, upon being rocked clockwise as by the setting clutch dog 394, engages an ear 384 on a, second lever 3S5 pivoted on the shaft 386 and normally held in its illustrated position by a spring 392 tensioned between the second lever and the machine frame. The lever 395 is connected through a pin and slot connection 381 with a motor switch operating arm 388 which is effective, upon being rocked from its illustrated position by the arm 385, to close the driving motor circuit. 
Main clutch control The main clutch 429 (Figure 3) is rotatably mounted on a rod 429 and is normally held disngaged by a clutch dog 395 pivoted on a shaft 6| I and urged into contact with one of a plurality of diametrically opposed notches in the clutch by a spring 612 tensioned between the machine frame and a toggle linkage 610 connected to the clutch dog 395. 
 To efiect engagement of the main clutch under control of the setting clutch a cam 141 is keyed on the setting shaft 43! and engages a cam follower roller 145 mounted on a lever 146 pivoted on the, shaft 501 and spring urged into engagement with the cam. An interponent 503 is pivotally mounted at 694 on the lever 146 and is normally held in the position illustrated in Figure 3 by a tension spring 613 extending between ears formed on the interponent and the lever 146, respectively. The interponent 603 has a tip 6l 5 which is adapted to engage a notch 6L6 on-the main clutch dog 395 and thereby, when the shaft 431 is rotated, rock the dog 395 out from whichever notch in the main clutch 428 it was seated and thereby enable the main clutch to transmit rotation from the motor drive to the actuator mechanism including the gears E89 (Figure 6). 
 To provide for continued multicyclic operation of the main clutch in certain calculations, as for example division, a, latch .632 (Figure 3) is provided which is pinned to a rockable shaft 626 and urged clockwise by spring 633 into engagement with an ear 620 on the clutch dog 3195. When the clutch dog 395 is rocked clockwise in division and certain other calculations a roller 934 mounted on the upper end of the latch 632 moves into latching engagement with the under edge of ear 629 and thereby holds the main clutch dog 395 from moving into engagement with the main clutch 428. 
 "The clutch dog 395 also maintains the motor circuit completed during operation of the main clutch 428. Upon rocking of the dog 395 to effect engagement of the main clutch an extention 498 thereon (Figure 5) engages an ear 491 on the aforementioned lever 396 to rock this lever clockwise and thereby rock the switch control arm 399 (Figure 22) in the same manner as was described in connection with the control of arm 389 by the setting clutch dog 394- to complete the motor circuit. 
 It will be noted that the main clutch dog 395 is rocked clockwise to effect engagement of the main clutch before the clutch dog 394 is allowed to seat in one of the notches in the setting clutch 439 so that the lever 399 and shaft 386, and consequently the switch control arm 388, will be held rocked in a position to maintain the motor circuit closed throughout both the setting clutch cycle and the ensuing main clutch cycle or cycles Without interruption. 
Dipping of accumulator register Upon rotation of the setting shaft 48! and in advance of actuation by the main clutch 428, the various accumulator drive gears 21! (Figure 6) carried by the shiftable carriage 259 (Figure l) are enmeshed with the aligned actuator drive gears I89, described hereinbefore, this being accomplished by cams, one of which is shown at 514, .keyed on the setting shaft 43L The various sets of gears 2H and 213, as well as other elements (not shown) of the accumulator register, are carried on a series of plates 266 all pivoted by means of a rod 262a to the main body of the carriage and all are connected at their rightmost end, as viewed in Figure 6, to a common bail 299. 
 The means for raising and lowering the bail 259 to effect engagement and disengagement of the various gears 21! and I89 comprises a pair of links, one of which is shown at 566, slidable over pins 561 on spaced frame plates of the machine. Each link is provided with rollers 558 engaging the bail 269 on opposite sides thereof and is urged upwardly by a spring 539 tensioned between the links and a pin on the machine frame. The links 596 are pivoted at 512 to cam follower levers 519 rockable on a shaft 225, the levers 519 having rollers 513 engaging the cams 514 so that upon rotation of the shaft 431, the followers 519 and links 556 are moved to positively pull down the bail 269 against the action of the spring 569. 
 Means are provided to latch the accumulator register in its lower position during actuation. 
This means includes latch levers 575 pivoted at 516 to the machine frame and urged by springs 519 into latching engagement with ears 518 on the cam follower levers 510. When the various plates 266 and the mechanism carried therebi are dipped the ears 578 ride over the noses 51! of the latch levers 575 and are latched therebeneath, thus retaining the gears 21! in mesh with the actuator gears I89 until termination of operation of the main clutch at which time the latches 515 will be released as will be described presently. 
 Referring to Figures 6 and 7, the means for releasing the latches 575 comprises levers 539 pinned on a rockable shaft coaxial with a shaft 58!. On one of the levers 539 is a stud 536 engaged by an arm 580 pinned to shaft 58!. Also pinned to shaft 58! is an arm 584 engaged by an ear 592 on an arm 59! pivotally supported on a shaft 590 and provided with an extension adapted to be engaged by a roller 593 carried by a supporting disc 105A which is fixed to a sleeve rotatably mounted on a shaft 649. This sleeve 594 is driven by a separate clutch which is operated only as an incident to termination of main clutch operations and is known as the restore clutch. 
 When the main clutch dog 395 is moved to stop and disengage the main clutch 423 (Figure the restore clutch lilil (Figure 6) to be described hereinafter, starts operation and rotates the disc 100A (Figure 7). Movement of the roller 593 rocks the lever 59! clockwise to rock the lever 584 and so rock lever 588, which engages the pin 536 on the juxtaposed lever 539. Lateral extensions 583 on the levers 539 engage and rock tails formed on the latches 515 releasing the ears 518 and allowing the springs 569, under control of the restore clutch, to return the accumulator register mechanism to an upper position. 
 The sleeve 594 of the restore clutch 100 carries a cam 595 (Figure 6) which is employed to prevent the carriage from rising too rapidly under the action of the springs 569 whenever the latches 57-5 are released. The cam 596 is engaged by a cam follower lever 59'! fixed to a rockable shaft 600. A pair of arms 5% also fixed to the shaft 609 are joined by pin and slot connections 6612 to the links 556 so that the rate of rise of the carriage under the pull of spring 569 is no greater than that permitted by rotation of the cam 596. 
Restore clutch The restore clutch let (Figures 4 and 6), besides effecting release of the carriage latch levers 575 and controlling the rate of return of the bail 269 and parts of the accumulator register to their upper positions also conditions certain of the division control mechanism, as will appear hereinafter, under the section entitled Division control. The restore clutch is jointly controlled by the accumulator register dipping mechanism and by the main clutch dog in such a way that whenever the accumulator register is in its lower position and the main clutch dog 395 is seated in I the notch of the main clutch, the restore clutch will engage and complete one cycle of operation. 
 The restore clutch is similar in construction to that disclosed in the patent to Friden Number 1,643,710, issued September 27, 1927, and is directly controlled by an extendin nose 102 (Figure 4) on a clutch release dog in the form of a bell crank 4-05 which is freely supported on the shaft 600. An M-shaped lever m3 is provided to control the clutch release dog 455 and has one footthereof pivotally mounted on the shaft 600. 
A short arm 704 extending from the lever 103 is provided with a tenon on which is positioned a compression spring 105 extending between the arm 104 and the left arm of the clutch release dog 405. 
 An arm 122 keyed to the shaft 600, and thus rocked by dipping movement of the carriage, is connected to the M-shaped lever 103 by a combined compression expansion link unit 123, as disclosed in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent 2,216,659. The link unit 123 is composed of a pair of links H5 and H6, the former pivoted at one end thereof on a stud mounted on the arm 122 and the latter link TIE pivoted at one end thereof on a stud extending from the lever 103. The two links slide relative to each other and have elongated slots at the free ends thereof each slidable over the pivotal studs for the other link. A compression spring H4 is inserted in a pair of coextensive apertures formed in the two links; being positioned over opposed tenons extending from each link, and opposes any attempt to lengthen or shorten the link unit beyond its normal length illustrated in Figure 4. 
 Now, at the start of a calculation, and as the setting clutch is rotated, the main clutch dog 395 is withdrawn from contact With the main clutch and an extension 408 of the dog 395 is withdrawn from beneath a latch lever 10! pivoted to the machine frame and urged counter-clockwise by a spring H'i tensioned between the latch lever and the machine frame. The latch H1! is therefore rocked counter-clockwise and an ear H8 thereon is rocked into a notch H9 formed in the M-shaped member M3 to prevent counterclockwise movement of lever 103 until the main clutch has been disengaged by reseating of its dog 355 in one of the full cycle notches of the clutch 428. The lowering of the accumulator register mechanism (Figure 6), however, tends to engage the restore clutch even before the main clutch engages and a second restrainingmeans is provided to prevent this operation. 
 The left foot of the lever 103 is provided with a shelf 12d overlying one end of a bell crank 12!, pivoted on the shaft 6! I, and having a roller 16'! at the other end thereof in engagement with a cam H38 keyed on the setting shaft 43!. On rotation of the setting clutch, therefore, the bell crank 12! is rocked to raise the lever 103 and thus insure that the ear N8 of the latch member 10! will be able to engage the notch H9 properly when the main clutch is engaged. As the setting clutch continues through a single cycle of operation the cams 514 (Figure 6) effect clipping of the accumulator register mechanism and, consequently, the shaft 500 is rocked counter-clockwise. Therefore, the arm F22 (Figure 4) keyed to the shaft 655 is lowered and the link unit I23 is lengthened against the opposition of its spring H4. The parts remain so positioned withthe spring H4 compressed until the main clutch dog 355 is permitted to reseat in a notch of the clutch 428 whereupon the extension 458 thereon strikes the ear H0 of the latch lever 10!, rocking it clockwise and removing its lug H8 from the notch H 9 of the lever 103. Spring H4 then expands shortening the link unit 123 and rocking the member 753 counter-clockwise to carry the left leg (Figure 4) of lever 703 down against the leftw'ardly extending arm of the bell crank 405 to rock this lever counter-clockwise and remove the nose Hi2 thereon from engagement with the restore clutch H30, thereby enabling the clutch to become engaged. 
 Operation of the restore clutch, thus initiated, causes the latches 515 (Figure 6) to be released in the manner disclosed in connection with Figure '1 and controls the rate of rise of the links 566 through the cam 599, as previously described, enabling the springs 569 to rock the shaft 600 and arm 122 (Figure 4). This movement of arm 122 tends to compress the spring 1I4 which, being stronger than the spring 105, transmits a rocking movement to the link 123 and lever 183 to compress the spring 105 until the nose 102 of the restore clutch dog 405 can reenter into an aperture of the housing of the restore clutch 100, whereupon the restore clutch becomes disengaged and the mechanisms are brought to rest in the position illustrated in Figure 4. 
 The restore clutch dog 405', when moved counter-clockwise to effect engagement of the restore clutch 100, causes the motor circuit to be closed. This is accomplished by the leftwardly extending arm of the dog 405 (see Figures 4 and 5) which engages the car 401 on the lever 396 and rocks the shaft 386, levers 391 and 385, and the motor circuit switch arm 388 in the same manner as does the main clutch dog 395. To insure that the motor circuit is held closed throughout the period in which the accumulator register is helddipped, a lever I60I (Figure 22) is keyed to the shaft 600 and has an ear I602 which, when the accumulator is dipped and the shaft 600 (Figure 22) rocked counter-clockwise, engages the car 384 of lever 385 to insure that the switch arm 388 maintains the motor circuit. 
closed. 
Division control As disclosed in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent 2,216,659, division is performed by setting up the dividend in the accumulator register 3I8, as by the usual adding operation, and then setting up the divisor in the keyboard, and depressing the division initiating key 910 (Figures 1 and 11). The machine thereupon carries out automatically the operation of dividing the divisor into the dividend and registering the quotient in the counter register I814 carried by the shiftable carriage 250. The operation consists of successive subtractions of the divisor from those digits of the dividend which are registered in orders of the carriage aligned with the portion of the selecting mechanism containing the divisor, and which may be called the effective dividend. As the carriage is automatically shifted to the left, additional dividend digits in the accumulator register are successively brought into alignment with the part of the actuator mechanism controlled by the portion of the keyboard upon which the divisor is set until the carriage reaches its leftmost position. Since the construction and operation of the division control mechanism is described in detail in the above Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, only that part thereof which coacts with the mechanism of the present invention will be described herein. 
 The division initiating key 910 (Figure 11) is mounted on a key stem 91! supported by a pair of parallel levers 912 and 913 pivotally mounted on the machine frame. A roller 914 on the bottom and of the key'stem 91I normally lies in front of a division control member 915 (see Figure 9). 
The member 915 is pivotally mounted on a shaft 916: and is urged clockwise by a strong spring 911 tensioned between an arm formed on the member 915 and a pinon the machine frame work. 
When. the division key is. depressed the. roller 914 pas ses beneath the face 918 on the lever 915 allowing the spring 911 to rock the member 915 clockwise until a roller 919 at the top of the member 915 strikes the main operating bar 503 (Figure 2) and, as described hereinbefore, depresses the bar to effect engagement of the setting clutch 430. As the key 919 is depressed to its lowermost position against the action of a tension spring (not shown) an extension 980 (Figure 11) on the lever 913 is brought into alignment with a notch 98I on a latch 982, at which time the latch 982 is rocked by a tension spring 993, until this notch engages the extension 980 on the lever 913 to maintain the division key 919 depressed. 
 The setting" clutch 430 (Figure 2), upon being initiated into operation by the division control member 915, will efiect operation of the main clutch 428 (Figure 3), as previously disclosed, and the spring 833 will become active to hold the latch 632 in latching engagement with the main clutch dog 395 to enable multicyclic operation of the main clutch. The actuator mechanism including the gears I99 (Figure 6) are conditioned to operate in a subtractive direction by the depression of the division key 919 (in a manner not shown) so that the divisor set up on the keyboard will be subtracted one or more times from the'dividend appearing in the accumulator register. 
 During rotation of the active accumulator re ister dials 219 (Figure 9) a snail cam ZBI connected to each of the dials will be rotated in a clockwise direction, and a cam follower 3I5 i pivoted on the rod 212 and following its respective cam by means of a roller 3I6 will depress a shelf formed on a sensing lever I pivotally supported at 992, thus rocking the lever 99I clockwise. A foot 995 on one or more of the levers 99! is normally engaged during division by a sensing bail 991 pivoted at 942 to.the machine frame and urged clockwise by a spring 944 tensioned between the machine frame and an arm on the bail 991. A link 21 I5 is connected between an arm on the bail 901' and a lever 2| IB pivoted at 2'! I9 to the machine frame. The lever 2| I8 is connected through a pin and slot connection to an arm 2129 pinned on a shaft 2I2l. 
 Referring to Figure 3, a bell crank 2013, also pinned on the shaft 2I2I, has a leftwardly extending arm underlying an ear 2I24 of the main clutch dog latch 932, so as to engage and rock the latch 932 out from under the main clutch dog 395 upon tripping of the bail 901 by the sensing levers 99L Now, since the position of the pivot 992 (Figure 9) of each of the sensing levers 90I is controlled by the size of thedigits in the controlling orders of the divisor, as disclosed in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, when the remainder in the accumulator dials is reduced to approximately one-half of the divisor, the cam 28l in the controlling order of the accumulator will have forced its cam follower 3I5 and, consequently the corresponding: sensing lever 99!, to a position wherein the foot 906 on the sensing lever 90! passes above the rightwardly extending finger of the bail 901, permitting the spring 944 to rock the bail 901 clockwise and effect release of the latch 632 (Figure 3) to stop the main clutch. 
 It will be recalled that the main clutch dog- 395 (Figures 4 and 5), when rocked home by its spring 612, will trip the latch 10I and allow the now extended link unit 123 to contract and rock ii the lever 103 and the restore clutch dog 405 counter-clockwise and enable engagement of the restore clutch. 
 During the restore clutch cycle and while the accumulator register is being raised, a link 846 (Figure 9) is moved to the left by a cam 849 driven by the restore clutch 100. A lever 841 pivoted on the shaft 916 and pivotally connected to the link 846 is rocked counter-clockwise. This lever 041 has a notched bell crank I042 pivota'lly mounted thereon and adapted to engage an ear I021 extending from the division control member 915. A second bell crank I044, freely mounted on the shaft 916, has one end thereof provided with an elongated slot embracing a pin I046 on the bell crank I042. A spring I045 tensioned between the other end of the bell crank I044 and the frame holds the bell crank I042 in position to engage the ear I021 during the first part of the movement of the cam 849 (providing the division control member 915 has been rocked clockwise of its illustrated position by spring 911), but causes the bell crank I042 to be rocked counter-clockwise relative to the lever 841 upon continued movement of the cam 849 (if the member 915 is maintained in its illustrated position) so as to override and miss the ear I021. 
 The division control member 915 is pivotally connected at I065 to a link I054 (Figures 8, 9, and 12) urged counter-clockwise relative to the member 915 by a tension spring I 054a extending between the link and the member 915. Link I054 has a shoulder I055 adapted to engage an ear I056 on a bell crank I051 pivoted on a pin 4H] and normally held in its illustrated position by a tension spring I064 extending between the bell crank and the machine frame. An ear I058 (see also Figure 2) on the bell crank I051 overlies the setting clutch operating bar 503. When the member 915 is first rocked clockwise upon depression of the division key 910, the link I054 is carried thereby to allow the shoulder I055 to drop to a position behind the ear I056 on the bell crank I 051. Now, upon the succeeding restore clutch cycle, the cam 849 (Figure 9) causes the member 915 to be rocked counter-clockwise back to its original position and during this time the shoulder I055 of the link I054 engages the ear I056 to rock the bell crank I051 clock-wise against the action of the spring I064, causing the ear I058 to depress the setting clutch operating bar 503 (Figure 2) and initiate a corrective cycle as described in detail in the above mentioned Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, to correct for an overstroke if such has occurred. Means (not shown) are provided to release the link I054 from engagement with the ear I056 of the bell crank I051 during the succeeding setting clutch cycle so as to all-ow the parts to return to their illustrated position. 
d When the division control member 915 is rocked counter-clockwise by the action of the restore cam 848, link 846, lever 841, and the bell crank I042, it is retained in a leftward position by a latch lever I050 (Figure 8) which is pivoted at the left thereof (in a manner not shown) to the machine frame and is spring pressed downward to engage an ear I052 on the division control member. After completion of the corrective cycle and during the subsequent carriage shift the latch I050 is released, as will be described presently, to allow the spring 911 to again rock the division control member 915 clockwise so as to initiate a new division operation in the new carriage position. It should be noted that the .diYiSiQh k Carriage shift control in division A complete disclosure of the carriage shifting mechanism and controls therefor will be found in the aforementioned Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, but will be briefly outlined herein to illustrate the connection thereof with the mechanism of the present invention. 
 Shifting of the carriage to the right or to the left is effected under motor power by rocking a control lever I300 (Figure 24) about its pivot I30I to one side or the other of its illustrated neutral position so as to engage one or the other of two ratchet discs I363 and I305 of a reversibly operable planetary carriage shifting mechanism. The control member I300 is connected through a resilient connection I313 to a link I314 pivoted on a member I315 rockable on a shaft I318 and is normally held in its neutral position by a centralizer lever I4I0 pivoted at I4IIa to the machine frame and urged counter-clockwise by a centralizer spring I400 tensioned between a machine frame stud I40! and an ear I402 on the centralizer lever I 4:0. The centralizer I 4I0 has an ear I0 I 3 thereon engaging the lever I315 above the shaft i316 and also has an adjustable pro-- jection I4I6 secured thereon and engaging the lever I315 below the shaft I316. 
 An ear I384 (see also Figure 8) is adapted to be engaged by a hook formed on a floatin dog I383 pivoted on a lever I380 which is also pivoted on the shaft I316. 
 When the division key 910 (Figure 9) is depressed, an ear 91Ia thereon engages the leftmost end of the dog I383 and rocks the same counterclockwise until it hooks the ear I384. A floating shift control lever I311 is pivoted at I319 to the lever I 380 and the left most end thereof, as viewed in Figure 8, is weighted so that it tends to rock counter-clockwise about its pivot I319. 
 At the end of a division operation in a -particular carriage position, the floating carriage shift control lever I311 is moved to the left, as viewed in Figures 6 and 8, to initiate a carriage shift to the left. During the division operation in a certain carriage position an ear i386 on one of the cam followers 510 is moved to the right of its position illustrated in Figures 6 and 8 by virtue of the dipping movement imparted to the. 
 links 566 by the cam followers 510 when rocked by the cams 514 so that the weighted left end of the lever I311 will rock the lever counter-clockwise unti1 the notch I390 formed by .a shoulder I385 on the right hand edge thereof embraces the ear I388. Now, as the final restore clutch cycle ensues, enabling the springs 569 to lift the links 566 and rock the cam followers 510 counterclockwise, the floating lever I311 is shifted to the left by the ear I386 and the dog I383 is likewise shifted to the left through the action of the lever I380. Since the dog I383 is at this time hooked over the ear I384 (Figures 8 and 24) of the shift link I314, the shift control member I300 will be rocked to engage the ratchet wheel I305 of the planetary carriage shift mechanism to effect a leftward shift of the carriage. 
 It should be understood that the above carriage shifting operation takes place at the end of the final restore clutch operation in each carriage position following the restorative" cycle instead of at the end of the first restore clutch operation. This is effected by reason of the fact lever I311 to hold the same rocked to position the notch I399 thereof below the path of movement of the ear I396) until after the restore clutch has operated sufficiently to allow the cam follower lever to have rocked counter-clockwise and thereby move'the ear I386 to substantially its illustrated position wherein it {cannot engage the notch I399 and shift the floatinglever I311. During the restore clutch cycle following the restorative cycle, howeventhedivision con- .trol member 915, being latched in its counterclockwise rocked position by the latch I959, is ineffective to prevent initiationof the carriage shift. 
During the initial shift cycle one of a pair of rollers I363 (Figure 8) placed diametrically opposite each other on a disc I362, which is rotated by a shaft I33I connected to the planetary shift mechanism, rocks a lever I355 pivoted to the frame stud I35I against the action of a spring I I359, and a pin I359 on this lever engages and rocks a bell Crank I381 pivoted to the machine frame at I388. A shelf I389 extending from the bell crank underlies the latch I959 and the leftmost end of the link I311 so that the lever I311 will be rocked from engagement with the ear !386 to limit the shift operation to one step, and the latch I 959 will be raised to release the division control member 915 which will then be free to rock toward the right to initiate the di vision operation in the new carriage order. 
 During the carriage shifting operation, the motor circuit is held closed by the shift centralizing arm I4I9 (Figures 8 and 24) The lower end of centralizer lever MI! is connected by a, pivot pin 1 IMI to a link I4I2 (see also Figure 22) which is also connected by the pivot pin 493 to a bell crank 492 pivotally supported by the machine frame and, in turn. connected by means of a link 4.94 to the combined interlock and motor circuit operating lever 391 pinned on the shaft 386. Thus, as the centralizer lever I4 I 9 is'rocked clockwise by the lever I389, regardless of which direction this latter lever is rocked, the link I4I2 will be pulled to the left effecting a clockwise rocking movement of the lever 391 which engages and rocks the lever 385 to operate the motor circuit arm 398 and close the motor circuit. 
Termination of operation in division The above repetitive tour of operations is repeated in each successive carriage position until the carriage reaches its leftmost position when further operation of the carriage shifting mechanism is prevented and the machine is brought to a standstill. As'the carriage moves into its leftmost position, a projection I519 (Figure 11) carried by the right hand carriage plate 259a strikes the under surface of an inclined cam face I51I formed on the lever I512 so as to rock the lever counter-clockwise against the action of a tension spring I513 extending between the lever I512 and the machine frame. 
 During division operation, with the carriage in its leftmost position, the division key will be unlatched and permitted to rise. A ,leftwardly extending arm of the lever I512 underlise an ear I961 on the upper end of a bell crank I968 pivoted at I999 to the divisionkeylatch1982. When the lever I512 is rocked counter-clockwise by the icarriage,zthe bell crank I 96815; rocked'by. azspring I910, extending between :the "bell crank andpart of the division key latch 982 to hook a leftward extension thereof around the ear I956 of the bell crank I951 (Figures 11 and 12). This bell crank, it will be recalled, is rocked by the link I954, connected to the division control member .915, during the first restore cycle in each order for the purpose of initiating a corrective setting clutch cycle. If the end of the bell crank I968 .be hooked over the extension I956 during such rocking, the bell crank I968 willbe pulled'to'the left rocking the latch lever 982 counter-clockwise about its supporting shaft I222 to release the lateral extension 989 of the leveri913 and-permit the division key 919 to be raised'by a suitablespring (not shown). 
 A division operation maybe terminated atthe conclusion of operation in any carriage position by a single depression of the stop key 985 'leaving a quotient digit in that order accurately registered, or it may be terminated at once by two successive depressions of the same key which may possibly leave an inaccurate quotient digit in the counter. The stop key 985 (Figure 10) is slidably supported upon pins extending from the machine frame and is provided with an offset 966 which overlies a lever I915 pivoted to the frame and connected by a pin and slot connection with a lever I916 pivoted on a shaft I988 and connected by means of a sleeve I916a (Figure 11) with a bell crank I911 which is normally urged in a clockwise direction by a tension spring I018 extending between the bell crank I911 andthe-machine frame. Upon depression of the stop key 985 the bell crank I91! is rocked in a counterclockwise direction and a link I919 pivotally connected thereto and normally urged upwardly by a spring I988, extending between a pin on'the machine frame and the link I919, is moved to the right. The link I919 carries a shelf I984 engageable with a tail I986 of the division key latch 982 and is limited in its upward travel under tension of spring I989 by an ear I985 formed on a, lever I981. The lever I981 is pivoted on the shaft I222 which carries the division key latch 982, and has but a limited swinging movement relative to this latch so that for the present purpose it may be considered as an integral part of the latch. Upon depression of the stop key 985 the link I919 is'moved to the right carrying its shelf 5994 against the lower end of the tail I695 of the division 'key latch 982. This swings the division key latch 982 counterclockwise releasing the division key to rise slightly until its roller 9M (Figure 9) engages the underside 9758 of the division control member 915. 
 Being released from the latch 992, the division key 918 is permitted to rise as soon as the division control member 915 has been moved to the positionin which it is shown in Figure 8. This occurs during the next cycle of operation of the restore clutch and the roller 913 of the division key stem is then. brought into blocking relation with thegmember 5915 preventing operative movement thereof. As the division key rises, roller 9'44 thereon first moves in front of member 915 and then raises ear I998 (Figure 8) on the latch member I959 to release member 915 from the latch, leaving .it restrained by roller 914 alone and ready for operation upon depression of the key. 
 A second depression 'o-f the stop :key after the latch .992 has been tripped also moves the link I919 to the right. It will be recalled, .zhowever, 
 15 that upon the first depression of the stop key the latch 982 was moved in a counter-clockwise direction. Thus, the lever I681 was swun upwardly and its ear I665 permitted the link I619 to rise under the action of its spring I986. This rise of the link I919 is sufficient to cause its right hand end to engage an ear 2I26 on an extension of a lever 2| I1 fixed to the shaft 626 upon the second depression of stop key 985. 
 Referring to Figure 3, it will be recalled that the latch 632 is also fixed to the shaft 625 so that movement of this shaft by the link I 616 will effect release of the main clutch dog 395 and thus immediately arrest operation of the main clutch, and a restore clutch operation will ensue. Ihe mechanism which is operated by the restore clutch for normally causing engagement of the shift clutch at the end of the operation in each order is disabled by the rise of the division key so as to not interfere with the operation of the automatic clearance and return shift mechanism described hereinafter. 
 A lever I255 (Figure 7A) is fixed to the same shaft I 256 which carries the lever I628 (Figure 11) connected to the division key linkage 965 and 973 described hereinbefo-re. The lever I255 carries a latch I24I (Figure 7A) which is urged counter-clockwise about its pivot stud I253 by a spring I243, so that upon depression of the division key and consequent clockwise rockin of shaft I256 and lever I255, the latch I24I is moved toward the right from above an ear I244 formed on an arm I229 of a, bail assembly freely pivoted on the shaft I222, and the spring rocks the left end of the latch I 24! down and immediately to the right of the ear I244. This bail assembly of which the arm I229 is a part is urged clockwise about the shaft I 222 (Figure 7A) by a spring I 235 its movement in that direction being limited by engagement of an arm I223 of the bail assembly with an ear I240 on a member of the addition mechanism not shown. An ear I230 is formed on a second arm I 22I of the aforesaid bail assembly and underlies a lever I23I, freely pivoted on a stud I232, and provided with a portion I233 underlying the left end of the shift control link I311 (see also Figure 6). 
 The arrangement of the above described mechanism is such that when the division key is released and permitted to rise upon depression of the stop key or operation of the end position mechanism described hereinbefore, the shaft I256 and lever I255 are rocked counter-clockwise. The left end of latch I24I lies substantially against the right side of ear I244 at this time so that upon counter-clockwise rocking of shaft I256, the latch pushes ear I244 toward the left and rocks the bail assembly counterclockwise. The resulting upward movement of the ear I236 rocks the lever I 23I upwardly, whereupon the lug I233 on the latter lever engages the lower surface of the shift control lever I311 and rocks the same upwardly or clockwise about its pivot stud I319 (Figure 6). 
This moves the right end of the shift control lever down and out of the path of the ear I386, so that leftward movement of the latter during the restore clutch cycle will not be effective to actuate the shift control link I311. 
 Since the link I311 must be freed so as to permit operation thereof for controlling the shift mechanism in other calculations, the above mechanism is adjusted to permit return of the link I311 to active position soon after the ear I386 has passed above and past th shoulder I385 on-the right end of link I311. 
This release is effected during the restore clutch cycle following the rise of the division key, this usually being referred to as the second restore clutch cycle which controls the operation of the following mechanism. As described in the Avery Patent Number 2,216,659, shaft H52, and a lever I246 fixed thereto (Fig. 7A), are rocked counter-clockwise under control of the restore clutch cam 536 (Fig. 6) and the linkage including link I1I3. Lever I246 carries an interponent I241 (Figure 7A) which, upon such counter-clockwise rocking of lever I246, moves upwardly, whereupon a shoulder I 243 of the interponent engages an ear I25I on the latch I24I and rocks the latter upwardly to the position shown, to release the ear I244 from restraint of the latch and to permit return of the bail assembly and lever I23I to the position shown. During the latter part of the upward movement of the interponent after the latch I241 has released ear I244, a portion of the interponent engages the shaft I222 and rocks the interponent counter-clockwise about its pivot stud thereby removing the shoulder I248 from beneath ear I25I and releasing latch I24I for downward movement under urge of the spring I243 until blocked in the position shownby ear I244. 
 During each restore clutch cycle the cam 596 actuates the lever I246 as described above, but so long as the division key is in depressed position, the shaft I256 and lever I255 (Figure 7A) are held in their extreme clockwise position and latch I24I stands in a position down and to the right of that in which it is shown, therefore upward movement of the interponent I241 is ineffective throughout all restore clutch cycles in a division calculation except the one following the release of the division key. The interponent is also ineffective in the first restore clutch cycle in which the division key is released since release of the key is timed to occur subsequent to th upward movement of the interponent. 
 When the division key rises following restoration of the division control lever 915 (Figure 9) by operation of the restore clutch through what is known as first restore cycle, the shaft I256 is rocked counter-clockwise and latch I24I is moved leftwardly against ear I244 to rock arm I229 and thereby disable the shift control lever i311 as described in detail hereinbefore, so that no shift operation will be initiated by operation of the restore clutch during what is known as the second restore cycle. The cam 596 (Figure 6) whichnormally initiates a shift operation by controlling the movement of ear I386 and the shift control lever I311 also controls the rocking movement of the lever I246 and the mechanism for reenabling the lever I311. The timing of the movement of these two mechanisms is such that before the interponent I241 moves the latch I24I upwardly far enough to release ear I244, the ear I386 (Figure 6) moves over the top of the shoulder I385 of the shift control link I311. After such movement the shift disabling mechanism described in detail above is released from restraint of the latch I24I and returns to the position shown to reenable the shift control link I311 so that it may subsequently initiate an automatic shifting operation as described hereinbefore. 
Tabulator mechanism The machine to which the present invention
