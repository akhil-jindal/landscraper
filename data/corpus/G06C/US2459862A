 The .present invention relates to calculating machines vand more particularly to key set-up mechanisms therefor which areof the ten-key type. 
Key set-up mechanisms have ,heretoforebeen of .two distinctly different types, each havingits advantages and disadvantages. .One ofthcse two types is known as :the full or multiple column keyboard type whichhas a;plurality of columns of keys, each column having "nine or ,ten keys numbered zero or one to nine,.inclusiv e. This type has theadvantageof enablingjthe operator to set up a multidigit factor .in any selected columnoi keys so that the'factor soset up maybe properly located with respect to a second ,factor and/or to the result register, :buthas the disadvantage of making it necessary ,for theoperator to select theparticular columnin which each digit-is to be set, which is time consuming and conducive to errors in placing the iactordigits in their proper ordinal positions. 
 The second type of key set-up mechanism .is known as the ten-key typewhich has the advantage of enabling the operator to set up successive without having to constantly look at the keyboard, but has the disadvantages of .making .it 
necessary in certain calculationsto set up news before or after thesignificant digits of the: factor in orderto properly position the factor with respect tothe accumulatorregister. 
 The rnachine embodying the present invention has the advantagesof both of these typesand neither, and is so arranged that the factors may-be set up rapidly ona ten- .key keyboard, and by ,means of .an automatic positioning mechanism-thefactors so setup are accurately positioned, in proper :decimal :relation to the accumulator register. This automatic positioning mechanism-is'disclosed and claimed Serial N umber 506,519, filed Octoberlfi, 1943, of whichythisis a division; the invention claimed in the present case being that pertaining to the ten-keyset-up and control mechanism per se. These two cases arerso closely related-that reference to the; parent case is suggested to acquire understandingof the full advantages of the mechanism shown in the present divisional case. 
 Various modifications of ten-key set-up mechanisms have been devised whereby twofactorsof a calculation maybe set in .two separate'jfactor receiving devices bysthe same ten-key keyboard. 
These mechanisms .have heretofore included a single set-up carriage which is shifted step by step with respect to-one factor receiving device for setting up the successivedigits of one factor, then moved through all unset orders of the first factor receiving devieeandinto operative relaiactor receiving device.

 Itis a;further object of the invention to utilize the depressison of a calculation control key to enable one set-=up carriage and to disable the other. 
enable said normalizing mechanism, under certain conditions, to zeroize the factor ;,numeral wheel which was last set up'in either receiving device andto shiftthe corresponding set-up carriage into controlling relationship with saidnumoral wheel without changin the position of the other set-up carriage. 
 It is a further object to zeroize one or more numeral wheels upon asingle key depression, the number of Wheels zeroizedbeing determined by the length of time that the key is held depressed.

, The numeral keyboard mentioned hereinbefore effects entry of values into the factor numeral wheels by means of a shiftable set-up carriage it is aligned, and when it is in its half step position it is rendered ineifective to control the setting of any numeral wheel. The carriages are so related thatwhen the first of the two carriages, for example, is shifted into its full step position, the second carriage is retained in a half step position so that depression of a selected numeral key effects entry of the digit corresponding to the numeral delineated thereon, into only that numeral wheel with which the first carriage is aligned. Depression of a control key, such as the X key I55, then is adapted to escape the first carriage into its half step position and to release the second carriage for movement into its full step position, so that subsequent depressions of the numeral keys then effect entry of digits into the factor indicator associated with the second carriage. 
 Factor selection switches are positioned concurrently with the rotation of the factor numeral wheels and are adapted to condition certain selection circuits explained hereinafter, in accordance with the position to which the numeral wheels are'rotated. 
 The reference numerals shown in the drawings but not'referred to in the following detailed, description of the machine correspond to those in the copending application Serial Number 506,519 of which this is a division. 
' Keyboard shafts 'lfiB to I99 by means of the link and lever connections, such as lever 299 secured to the end of shaft I89, and connected by link 2H3 to lever 22!] fixed to the zero shaft I95. Likewise, shaft EM is connected to shaft E95, shaft I82 to shaft I92, et cetera. Depression of the respective numeral keys M0 to 249 thus rock the respective shafts I9!) to I99 counter-clockwise through a small angle, there being springs 230 to 239 (Fig. 6) for returning the keys, shafts, and links to the position shown after the keys are released. 
Any well known prior art interlocking mechanism could be provided, if desired, to prevent depression of two keys simultaneously or to prevent depression of a second key when one is down. 
'In the present mechanism, however, it is possible to depress two keys simultaneously, as in certain commercial calculating machines, but no misoperation will result therefrom since the lower numbered key always controls. 
Set-up carriages As described briefly hereinbefore, there is a left factor and right factor set-up carriage, each of which is controlled by the numeral keyboard and effects entry of selected digits into the left and right factor numeral: wheels respectively... These two carriages are identical, the right factor carriage 248 being shown in Figs. 2- and 6, the left. 
factor carriage 245. being shown in- Figure 5, and both carriages being shown in Figure 12. They are mounted and.- maintained upright on a common stationary shaft 246 by bushings 24'! and have tworollers-i lli which arerotatably mounted on studs integral with: the factor carriage and are guided by a stationary supportingrmember 249. Each carriage is composed of a flat plate 25! (Figure 12) and a hanged plate, or angle 25-2, which are heldtogethe-r by screws; such as screw 253' (Figure 6), and spaced by suitable spacers to. form a U-shaped section having the web 254 on the outer side. Clearance holes 256 (Figure-- 12) are provided in the carriage for the selection shafts tell to 539 so the carriage may be shifted transversely without the shafts. binding. 
 Mounted on the selection shafts between the plates of each carriage are levers 25'! which are fitted to and therefore rock with the shafts, and at the same time are slidable thereon, with the carriage, as it shifts from order to order during the set-up operation. The levers 25-! are operalever 258 releases theselecting arm 239 in the order with which the active set up carriage is currently associated so as to effect rotation of the related. numeral wheel and position the selection switching mechanism. Each selecting lever 25% has an car 265'- which, in addition to being engaged by its associated lever 251, extends across the plane of an arcuate plate 269 which is slidable on shafts 255 and 267, one such arcuate plate 269 being located. adjacentto' each of thebrace plates 265. Lugs 2H are located on the plate 269 in, front of the ears 268 so that clockwise rocking of any one of the levers 258 slides plate 269. clock.- wise about the central shaft, 279. A pawl 274' is pivotally mounted on each stationary plate 26!. andis pressed into one or the other of the, two notchesin its respective plate 269 by a spring 215, so as to retain the latter plate in either of its two positions. 
 The upper forward end of eachplate 269 terminates a nose 2', as shown in Figure 12, which nose is adapted to rock: a latch 278 (Figure 5) clockwise about the stationary shaft 264 against the. pressure of a torsion spring 279. A hookon the latch 21S normally underlies. a. laterally extended ear 280s of. the, arm. 28.0. and prevents counter-clockwise movement of the arm, but when the latch is. rockedv clockwise as described above, the hook is. removed from beneath the ear 288a and releases the arm. 28.0. A gear segment 285 is integral with the arm 280 which is freely pivoted on shaft 219. There is one such arm and gear segment in each denominational order of the left factor indicator and each is geared to its associated. numeral wheel by. gears such as 282 and 233 (Fig. 2). The arrangement is therefor such that depression of a selected key, for example the number 3 key, rocks shaft I93 (Figs- 5and (i) counter clockwise. Thelever 25'! mounted on this shaft in theleft. factorrset-up all  carriage in turn rocks thenose 2354; (Fig.5) of its associated lever 258 upwardly into the path ofear 280a. so that. when the arm. 280. is released by latch 278, a torsion spring 286- (Fig. 2): drives gears 283, 232, and 28L and rot-ates. arm 2801 counter-clockwise until the ear 280ais blocked by the nose 284 ofthe 3 blocking lever 258. The,- levers 258 are located around the center of shaft. 2'19 in such.- positions as to limit the rotation of. the arm 288 and its associated numeral wheel 285 by amounts indicative ofthe numeral keys depressed. The number 9 shaft H9 isout of its natural position, however, and is so located as to shorten the number 9 connecting link 209' (Fig. 5). It will be noted further that the number 9 lever 25'? (Fig. 5) has no lever 258 associated withit, but instead engages an car 28'! formed directlyon the plate 2%9 for-tripping latch 218. The arm- 2853 in the-case of a nine selection is blocked in its extreme counter-clockwise position by ashaft 285 (Fig. 5). 
Set-up carriage shifting mechanism After a digit is entered into a selected numeral wheel the carriage is shifted toward the right one step to a position where the levers 257- mounted in the carriage are aligned with the-levers 258 associated with the next numeral wheel to the right. A flexible cable 29! (Figs. 5 and 8) is attached to a stud 292 mounted on theleft fac tor carriage 245 while the other end is wound around a spool 293 (Fig. 5). A spring 284 tends to rotate the spool and thus pull the carriage toward the right (Fig; 8). Rightward movement is normally blocked by one of a series of levers 295, there being one such lever in each order mounted on thesame stationary stud 2-59 which supports the zeroblocking lever 258 (Fig. 5). A spring 21-36 tends to rock lever 2'95-clockwise, butthis movement is prevented by the car 2800. of arm 2%. When the arm is released by latch 27-8 and moves downwardly the spring 298 is thenfree to rock the stop lever 295 clockwise and out of the path of a lug 2E! slidably mounted on the carriage, as shown in Figs. 9- and 12, and described more in detail hereinafter. The carriage is then free to move toward the right under urge of the spring driven cable until the lug strikes the next stop lever 2S5 (Figs. 8 and 12). Theset up of another digit in the next order againreleases the carriage and so on after each digital value is set up. 
 The same keyboard effects, entry of digital values into the right factor indicator I30 (Fig. 1) as well. In multiplication, the operator depresses the X key I55; or the Neg. X key 556 after entry of the multiplicand factor into the left factor indicator, and the above X keys release the left factor set-up carriage, effect the blocking thereof in a half step inoperative position, and escape the right factor set-up. carriage from its half step position into its operative full step position. 
 Taking these operations in the above order, the X key I55 orNeg; X'key 558 (Fig. 2) is adapted to rock the zero selecting shaft !98 so as to release the-left fact-or carriage; This shaft is divided, as shown in Fig. 3, and has hubs and till integral with the left and right section; of the shaft, respectively. A flange integral v 11 the hub i has a n0se3fi2 which over-lies a lateral extension on the flange of hub see, so that the left half of theshaft, which controls only the left factor set-up may be rocked count r-clockwise (as viewed in" Fig. 2) by the X or Neg. X'keys without rocking the right half associated with the right factor indicator, but when the right half of t e shaft is rocked by the linkage from the Zero numeral key, the nose 302 depresses the lateral extension 383 and rocks the left half of the shaft. This arrangement is provided to enable the X keys to release the left factor carriage without releasing the right factor carriage, and at the same time to enable the" Zero numeral key to rock both parts of the shaft for controlling entry of a zero in either the left or right factor indicator. 
 The X keys I55 and i56 (Fig. 2) are mounted for up "and down movement on studs 304 and 385 and are normally maintained in raised position by springs 306. The keys also have cars 38? and 308, respectively, which are adapted to rock two bell cranks 339 and 3H! counterclockwise about a stud 352. and a shaft HE, respectively, on which they are freely pivoted. A link 3E6 connects the two bell cranks and is moved toward the right when either key is depressed. A lever 313 is fixed to the shaft 3!?) and has a link 3W pivoted thereto which is urged downwardly by a spring 3H5. An ear 3H is formed on link 3H3 and lies adjacent a shoulder of lever 319 so that rightward movement of the link rocks lever 3H8 and shaft 3! 5 counterclockwise. A second lever 32% is fixed to the shaft 315 and has an ear 32! which is formed across the plane of a lever 322 which lever is freely mounted on shaft 355. A link 323 connects lever 322 with a lever 32d fixed to the left half of the zero shaft I213. The zero lever 25'! carried by the left factor carriage (but not the corresponding lever carried by the right factor carriage) is therefore rocked counterclockwise with the shaft Hit, in response to the depression of the X or Neg. X key and sets a zero in the numeral wheel immediately to the right of the last left factor numeral Wheel set up, and thereby escapes the left factor set-up carriage in the manner described hereinbefore. 
 The X and Neg. X keys are latched down for the duration of multiplication by means described later, and at the same time, the shaft 3l5 must be returned to its initial position for reasons also described in the aforementioned Averypatent application, therefore, a tripping mechanism is provided to disconnect the X and Neg. X keys from the above linkage. An arm 3|3 (Fig. 2) is provided on the bell crank 369 and underlies an ear 3H formed on the link did, so that during the last part of the depression of the X keys, after the zero shaft has been rocked far enough to effect escapernent of the left factor set-up carriage, the arm 3E3 engages the ear 3 and raises the shoulder of link 3E9 above ear 3H. A spring 3250, and a second spring 323a are then free to return the shaft (H5 and the left half of the zero shaft Edd to their initial positions, re spectively. 
 When the left factor carriage is released by the X or Neg. X key, as described above, the stud 292 (Fig. 8) mounted thereon moves toward the right. An arm 325, pivoted on a vertical shaft 33%, has a slot 326 in. which the stud slides, the shapeof this slot being such that equal linear steps of the carriage effect equal angular steps of the arm. Therefore, by blocking the arm 325 in a half step position, the carriage may be prevented from moving into its next operative full step position, and this is accomplished by operation of the following mechanism. 
v The arm 325 is shown in Fig. 16 in the position six steps from the initial position shown in Fig. 
8, for example, as if five multiplicand digits had been set up and the carriage had been shifted ready to receive the sixth digit. It will be noted that there are a series of ratchet teeth 335 on a segment of the arm 325 and a pawl 33'! adapted to move about a stud 338 into engagement with any one of the teeth. This pawl is formed into a bail, as shown in Figs. 10 and 14, and has a web 339, to which a spring 340 is attached to urge the pawl in a clockwise direction. A latch 34! (Fig. 16) is secured to a shaft 335 and normally retains the pawl 33? in the position shown in Fig-. 16 against the tension of spring 340, but when the X or Neg. X key 855 or 556 is depressed (Fig. 2) the latch is rocked counterclockwise in the following manner to release pawl 33?. The link 3E5 (Fig. 2), in moving toward the right (or rearwardly in the machine) rocks a lever 3:22 (Fig. 8) counterclockwise against the tension of a spring 549 and thereby rocks the shaft 335 to which lever 342 and latch 34! are fixed. This counter-clockwise rocking of shaft 335 removes the hook of latch 34%! (Fig. 16) from in front of the web 339, whereupon the spring 3% is free to rock the pawl 33'! into engagement with a ratchet tooth 336 as shown in Fig. 17. 
 Stud 338, on which pawl 33? is pivoted, is journaled in two elongated holes 3 33 in stationary frame plates 345 and 345a (Fig. 14). These holes 343 are indicated by the broken lines 3&3 (Fig. 16) from which it can be seen that the stud is normally held in the right end of the holes by latch 35 i, but when released from restraint of this latch it is moved into the left end thereof as shown in Fig. 1'7, by the combined pull of spring 3m and the ratchet teeth 339 of arm 325. The len of the elongated holes is such that when the stud moves from the right to the left end thereof, the arm 525 and the left factor set-up carriage 2&5 (Fig. 8) are permitted to advance, but are limited to half a step where they remain until the machine is cleared. 
 So far in this description it has been assumed that a five digit multiplicand has been entered into the left factor indicator, the X key has been depressed, and the left factor carriage has moved into its half step or inoperative position. Next, the right factor carriage must be rendered operative so as to effect entry of multiplier digits into the right factor indicator. 
 The right factor carriage has a stud 3 (Fig. 8) to which'is connected a flexible cable 3A8 urged toward the right by a second spring urged spool 349 (Fig. 2) around which the cable is wound in a manner described in connection with the left factor carriage. The right factor carriage arm 35% has a slot 35f (Fig. 8) having the same function as slot 326, and also has a series of teeth 352 which cooperate with a second pawl 353. This pawl is freely mounted on stud 338 and is urged counter-clockwise into engagement with the teeth by a torsion spring 354. An arm 356 of pawl 353 lies behind the web 33%; so that when the spring 3st rocks pawl 33'! and its integral web 339 clockwise to the position shown in Fig. 17 the pawl 353 is rocked out of engagement with the right factor ratchet 352 and releases the arm 35E! and the right factor set-up carriage, which is then blocked in its first full step operative position by the first one of the series of stops 295 (Fig. 2) in exactly the same way described in connection with the left factor set-up carriage. 
 The right factor set-up carriage 2 35 (Fig. 2) also has a series of levers 257. each being adapted upon actuation to rock into blocking position a selected one of the blockinglevers 258 in the current active order of the right .f-actor indicator I30, thereby setting the arm 280 in said order. The arm 280 .in each .order transmits its movement to its associated numeral wheel 351 by means of the segment 353, gears 353, and 36I, there being a spring 332 connected to gear 36f. to provide the torque for the above train. 
 It is to be understood that the parts and operation of the right factor set-up mechanism not specifically described are the same as those disclosed hereinbefore in connection with the left factor set-up mechanism. 
Clearance mechanism The factor selecting mechanism including the setup carriages and the factor numeral wheels may be returned to their normalized positions at any time before or after the -machine has performed anyof the calculations described in said Avery patent application. Before considering the actual clearing mechanism, however, it should be noted that two links 440 and 445 (Fig. 8) are connected to the left and right factor arms 325 and 353, respectively, by two studssuch as stud 442. In the other ends'of these links are formed aperures, such as aperture 435 formed in link 449 as shown in Fig. 7. Since both links are substantially the same, only the left :factor clearing mechanism will be described in detail. It should be noted further that a third link 48!], see also 11, having a differently shaped aperture 465 Fig. v8) should-not loo-confused with the two links in osiestion, since link iBG is associated with what is termed the flast digit mechanism for clearing the last digit, as will be described hereinafter. 
 It will be recalled that during the set-up of the left factor, the arm 325 rocks clockwise step by step. If an eightdigit 'multiplicand has been set up, the link 44!! is pulled downwardly, as shown in Fig. '7, until a shoulder 443 assumes the position 443A just above a stud 436. If a lesser number of di its are set up. as for example a four digit multiplicand, th shoulder moves'only half the distance between the solid line position designated 443 and the'dotted line position 443A. The right factor link 445 (Figs. 8 and 11) is similarly moved in accordance with the number of multiplier digits setup and assumes a similar position-relative to a corresponding stud 434 (Fig. 11). 
 From the foregoing then, it may be seen that by pulling links 440 and 445 upwardly, as viewed in Fig. 8, the arms 325 and 350 and the left and right factor set-up carriages, respectively, may be restored to their initial positions. This is accomplished by depression of a clear key I51 (Fig. 
 1) which first energizes either or both of two factor clearance conditioning solenoids, namely an LCC (left clearance conditioning) solenoid 441 and an ECG (right clearance conditioning )solenoid 448 (Fig.8), which are adapted to move-their respective links toward the right to "a position where the shoulders 443 lie in the path of the studs-433 and-434 (Figs. 7 and .-1'1) The clear key also effects engagement of a clear clutch which then pulls the studs upwardly in Figure 8, or rearwardly in the machine. Considering first the clearance conditioning mechanism, it will be noted that the solenoids 441 and 448 have long armature stems 45I and 452, respectively,carrying lugs 454 and 455, one of which is shown in Figure F7 lying in the :lower end of the aperture of its respective link 44!]. The stems 45I and 452 are guided in a stationary bracket 46I and are maintained toward the left by springs 463 and 462, respectively. 
 The clear key I 51, referred to above and shown in detail in Figure 22, .is mounted for up and down movement on two studs 31.! and 312 and is normally maintained in raised position by spring 313 tensioned between an ear 314 on the key stem and the stud 31L A latch 315 is freely pivoted on a shaft 316 and is urged toward the left by a spring 318. A lateral extension 31-1, formed on the latch, is normally blocked by ear 314 on the key stem, but when the key is depressed the ear 314 passes beneath the lateral extension 311 and allows the spring 3-18 to rock the latch 315 toward the left to lock the key in depressed position. An insulation tip 319, mounted on the latch 315, is moved downwardly and allows a switch 380 to close the circuit from the main line 382 (Fig. 13-) through the LCC and ECG solenoids as follows. The heavy lines 382 and 384 represent the main line for supplying electro-motive force to the various control circuits of the machine disclosed in'said Avery patent application and in this .case when the switch 339 is closed, the main line is connected to the clearance control circuit including lead 385, the normally closed contacts 386, lead 388, through the LCC solenoid 441 to ground, and also from lead 385 through a parallel circuit including the normally closed contactsGB'i, lead 389, through RCC solenoid 448 to gr and. Thus, immediately following depression of the clearkey I51 and closure of the switch 388, the solenoids 441 and 448 are energized and pull the links440'and 445 toward the right (Figs, 7 and 8). 
 The CC (clear clutch) solenoid 383 (Fig. 13) is also energized upon depressionof the clear key I51 which'closes either or both of the two parallel circuits described immediately hereinbefore, and .therefore energizes either or both of the branch leads 390 and 39! which lead from said respective parallel circuits through the CC solenoid to ground. A link 392 (Fig. 18) connects the solenoid armature 393 to a-clear clutch control dog .394 so that energization of the solenoid rocks the dog downwardly about the shaft 395 upon which it is freely pivoted, to first close thecircuit to the electric motor and then engage the clear clutch 406. A lug 40!, made of insulating material, is moved downwardly when the clutch dog 394 is rocked clockwise and allows the switch 492 to-close the circuit from the main line 384 (Fig. 13) through the electric motor 405 to ground. The motor 435 (Fig. 2) carries a pinion 4|? fixed to the motor shaft M3 and drives the gear 4I4 journaled on a stub shaft ME. A gear 455 (Fig. 19) is integral with gear 4M and meshes with an idler 4I1 which drives a gear 4I8 (Fig, 20). The latter gear is fixed to a clear clutch drive disc M I forming an integral unit freely rotatable on a clutch shaft-4 E3. The clear clutch is of the type disclosed in the Avery et a1. Patent 2,162,238, dated June 18, v1939, to which reference may be had for details of theclutch not specifically described herein. Clockwise movement of the clutch dog 394 (Fig. 18) effects engagement of the clear clutch by releasing a clutch pawl 488 (Fig. 19). The clutch pawl is freely pivoted on a stud M9, carried by a clutchdisc 401', and is urged counterclockwise about this stud by a spring 422 so that when the pawl is released, it rocks into engagement with the notched clutch drive disc 4! I, thereby causing engagement of the clear clutch. The clutch disc 401 is integral with a hub 4G3 and a cam 409, all of which are freely rotatable-on the "shaft 4H) and driven one revolution in a clock- '11 wise directionby the clutch driving disc 4! I when the clutch is engaged. 
 A cam follower 424 (Fig. 18) is fixed to a shaft 425 and is rocked counter-clockwise by cam 409 during the latter part of the clear clutch cycle. A lever 426 is also fixed to the shaft and has a spring 421 which maintains the roller 423 against the cam and returns the shaft 425 to the position shown at the end of the cycle. A link 430 is connected to lever 426 andhas three branch arms 43!, 432, and 433 (Fig. 11), two rollers 465 and 451 being provided for guiding the link 43B and its branch arms. The arms 43! and 433 carry the two studs 434 and 436, respectively, referred to hereinbefore. 
 The arrangement is such that following depression of the clear key, the LCC and RCC solenoids (Fig. 8) first pull their respective links toward the right from the position shown in Figure 7, and then the clear clutch effects rightward movement of link 43!], the studs 434 and 438 and links 440 and 445 (Fig. 11), which is upward as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. This rocks the carriage arms 325 and 35B counter-clockwise and shifts the carriages toward the left. 
 A stop lug 291 (Figs. 9 and 12) is mounted for up and down movement on a stud 463 (Fig. 8) on each carriage, and is guided by an ear 469 (Fig. 9) formed on the lug and extending through a s ot in the carriage. A spring 41! is tensioned between ear 469 and an car 412 on the carriage and normally maintains the lug in raised position shown in Fig. 9 but may yield so that if a stop lever .95 (Figs. 2 and in any order is locked down before the carriage is completely returned, the diagonal surface (Fig. 9) will cam the lug down as it passes beneath the stop lever, after which it will snap up into blocking position. 
 It was explained hereinbefore that during the set u operation the arcuate plates 259 (Fig. 2) are slid clockwise relative to the shaft 219 so that the noses 211 thereof rock the latches 21%; clockwise to release arms 28D. and that the plates are held in the latter position by the pawls 214. These plates must be returned to the position shown during the clearance operation so that when the arms 28! are restored, the atches 218 will be in position to hold them in their in tial positions. For this purpose carriages 244 and 245 each have an car 413 (Figs. 2 and 5) formed dia onally toward the right of the machine to provide a cammin surface which is adapted to engage the lugs 414 on the arcuate plates 269. The arrangement is such that as the carriages move leftwardly throu h the denominational orders of the right and left factor selecting mechanisms, the ears 413 successively engage the lugs 414 in each order and slide the p ates 269 counterclockwise where they are held by the pawls 214. The latches 218 are thus released so that springs 21!! may rock them into position to latch the arms 280 when the latter are returned to the position shown during the clearance of the factor numeral wheels. 7 g 
 The ears 413 mentioned above extend toward the right. a distance approximating half the distance between orders of the selecting mechanism, and it is therefore necessary to move both carriages an extra half step leftwardly beyond the leftmost order of their respective selecting mechanisms, so that the ears 413 may move thelu'gs and the plates 239 counter-clockwise in "such leftmost or highest orders, as well'as those in the lower orders as explained in the preceding paragraph. For this purpose, the slots 326 and 35! (Fig. 8) or the arms 325 and 350 are made longer than otherwise necessary to return the carriages to their first operative full step positions, and cam 483 (Fig. 18') is of such amplitude as to give the links and arms the overstroke for effecting this extra half step movement of the carriages. 
 This extra half step movement is utilized to render the set-up control mechanism effective to retain the right factor set up carriage in its extra half step or inoperative position, so that depression of the numeral keys for setting up the next problem will be effective to control the left factor set up carriage. During the extra half step movement of the left factor arm 325 (Fig. 17) the diagonal surface 355a first engages the nose of pawl 331 and rocks the latter counter-clockwise about stud 338 which moves the pawl 353 into engagement with the ratchet teeth 352 of the right factor arm 350, and then the abutment 355 engases the left end of pawl 331 and drives the assembly including pawl 353, stud 338 and bail 339 counter-clockwise about the center of shaft 333 to the position shown in Fig. 8, whereupon the latch 34!, under urge of spring 549, rocks clockwise to the latching position shown. When the clear earn 409 and follower 424 returns to the position shown in Fig. 18 at the end of the clear clutch cycle, the arms 325 and 350 (Fig. 8) are released and are urged toward the right of the machine by their spring urged cables 29! and 348 described hereinbefore. The arm 35!) is held in its extra half step position shown, however, by the pawl 353 which blocks the first tooth 352, thereby disabling the right factor carriage, whereas the pawl 331 is held away from the ratchet teeth of arm 325 by the latch 34! as shown, and permits the spring urged cable 29! to move the left factor carriage toward the right until it is blocked in its first full step operative position by the first stop lever 295. 
Clearance of the factor numeral wheels Concurrently with the return of the set-up carriages and related mechanisms described above, the factor numeral wheels are returned to their initial blank positions. The shaft 425 (Fig. 18), which drives the carriage return mechanism, is coupled to a coaxial shaft 415 (Fig. 21'), both of which are journaled in a bearing 41%. The coupling includes a tongue 411 on shaft 425 which is situated within a s ot 418 in the shaft 415 so that counter-clockwise movement of the shaft 425 rocks the shaft 415 the same amount. 
 An arm 480 (Fig. 18) is fixed to shaft 415, and has a gear segment 48! which drives the pinion 482 secured to the shaft 213. This latter shaft has a plurality of arms 483 (Fig. 2) fixed thereto, 
one in each denominational order of the right factor set-up mechanism. A stud 484 is mounted on each segment 358 and lies in the path of a stud 485 mounted on each arm 483. The arrangement is such that during the set-up operation, 
described hereinbefore the studs 484 move counter clockwise varying amounts depending upon the numerals set up in the different orders of the factor indicator, the maximum movement being somewhat less than 180 from the position shown in Fig. 2, and durin the clearance operation the studs 485 are rotated clockwise from the position shown through an angle somewhat less than 360, by operation of the clear clutch, and in so doing pick up the studs 484 and carry the segments 358 to and slightlyjbeyond the position shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig.18, the cam'4ll9 releases the cam follower 424 at the end of the clutch cycle, 
 113 whereupon spring "42'! returns the lever 426 and shaft 425 to the position shown, and a spring 43'! urges the arm 080 upwardly and rotates shaft 210 counter-clockwise and arms 83 (Fig. 2) back to the position shown. 
 The clearance of the left factor selection mechanism is accomplished in substantially the same way as that described above, the only difference being that the studs 285 are mounted on discs 852 (Fig. 12) one of which is keyed to shaft Elli in each order of the left factor indicator for use in partial product mechanism described in the aforementioned Avery patent application; and that the studs 43% which coact with the studs P are mounted on their respective discs one of which is mounted on the arm 28!! and segment 28'! in each order of the left factor indicator. Therefore, when the shaft 270 is rocked by the clear clutch mechanism as described above, the arms 280 of the left factor indicator are restored to their initial positions at the same time the right factor arms are restored. 
 The restoration of the arms 28% and their respective segments 28f and as above 'described, serves to rotate the factor numeral wheels 35! and 285 (Fig. 2) backwardly to their blank position by means of the gear train explained hereinbefore, thus tensioning the torsion springs 32 and 285. When the arms 2 30 reach the position shown in Fig. 2, they are locked by the latches 2'18 in each order, thus storing in the springs 352 and 2% the power derived from the motor, for use in driving the numeral wheels and the selection trainduring the set up of the next problem. During the restoration of arms 280, the lateral extensions 28cc (Fig. 7) engage the camming surfaces 86 and re .s the stop levers 295 counter-clockwise into the blocking positions shown, where they remain until the arms 289 are again released during the set up of the 'neXt problem. 
 The blocking levers 258, which are set in blocking position by depression of the numeral keys during the set-up operation, are also restored to the normal positions shown in Fig. 2 during the clearing operation. When the arcua'tc plates 259 are slid counter-clockwise, by the ears 4'73 described hereinbefore as forming a part of each of the two set-up carriages, the lugs 2H contact the ears 2'58 of the levers 25s which were previously set and rock the latter to the normal positions shown, where they remain until the numeral keys are again depressed during the set up of the next problem. 
 Means are provided to limit the clear clutch to one cycle irrespective of the length of time the clear key is held down. When the clear key i5! (Fig. 22) is depressed and spring 3'53 rocks latch 375 counter-clockwise, described herein'before, the lower edge of latch 31'5 engages an car 683 on a lever 289, thereby rocking lever counter-clockwise, latch 3'55 being free on the shaft 316 and lever 5-89 fixed on the shaft. A member 590 (Fig. 21) is also fixed on the same shaft 3'56 and'overlies an ear d0! of a latch 492, freely mounted on the shaft. so that counterclockwise rocking of shaft 315 rocks a shoulder 493 of'latch sea downwardly to free a lug 494 on a link 4955. An arm dill is to the shaft 415 and is moved toward the right when the shaft is rocked by cam 609 (Fig. 18). A'lever 498 (Fig. '21) freely pivoted on a stud 438 and connected to link 595 is thus released by arm 4'2? to allow "a spring iilc to pull the link 495 toward the left and rock the lever 493 clockwise. 
Link 395 has a from rocking counter-clockwise shoulder 50! which drops in front of an car 502 formed on the member 559. When the earn 409 -(Fig. 18) returns to the position shown and the roller 523 rides down the slope of the cam, there- :by allowing shaft @775 (Fig. 21) to rock clockwise. the arm 49.? engages the stud 503, rocking lever 193 counter-clockwise and pulling the link 395 toward the right. In so doing the hook 50] rocks the member 496 and shaft 3'55 clockwise. The member c and shaft 375 are moved through a considerable overstroke so as to rock the latch .375 (Fig. 22) clockwise to a position where it is locked by the shoulder of a second latch member 594. This opens the switch 389 and the circuit to theclcar clutch solenoid and holds the switch open even though the operator holds the key down. Thesolenoid 333 (Fig. 18) is thus deener g'ized. slightlybefore the clear clutch reaches the full cycle position shown, whereupon the spring 505 moves the clutch dog 394 upwardly into the notch in the clutch disc so as to disengage the clutch. .At any time either during or after the foregoing operation, the operator could release the clear key, but it would not in any event be able to rise until the-ear 3'54 (Fig. 22) had been released by latch sit, as above described. As sOon as the key is released both by the operator and by latch 375, it will rise, and in rising the car 314 will engage the latch 55% and raise it clear of the key latch so that the latter latch will be free to again come into operation, but by the time the key has risen sufilciently to thus release latch 315 the ear 3'54 will have moved up opposite the ear all, thereby preventing the latch and closing the switch until the key is again depressed. 
 When the foregoing operations have been completed the car 5332 (Fig. 21) must be free from the restraint of hook 56! so the shaft 316 and latch 40-315 22) may return to the position shown .pulling the link when the key is released, and thus be ready to properly function when the clear key is again depressed. For this purpose, a stud 506 is mount ed on the member ii-l8 and moves upwardly when the member is rocked clockwise by the book Slightly before the end of the stroke of link 495, the stud 566 engages the lower surface thereof and rocks the hook 5%! upwardly to disengage the ear 5:12 and allow the shaft 315 and the latch 31-5 to return to the position shown. A spring 501 is tensioned between the stud 505 and ear 49! and urges lever E52 upwardly so that when the lug 4'94 moves in back of the shoulder 493, the shoulder may snap'up and prevent the spring 496 from toward the left until a clearance con rol key is again depressed. 
Factor clearance disabling mechanism tor lock keys lfiii i5! (Figs. 1 and 13) which are provided in the machine fully disclosed in the Avery application Serial Number 506,519 of which this is a division. These keys are adapted to be latched down when depressed so that depression of the main clear key 5'1 will be effective to clear all the numeral wheels, except those of the factor indicator correspondin to the lockkey-depressed. The lock keys may be released by theirrespective R (release) .keys, fully described in said Avery application, which keys are so arranged that partial depression thereof only release their respective lock keys while the complete depression both releases the lock keys and effects clearance of the respective factor indicators. 
 As described hereinbefore under the heading Clearance mechanism, the links 443 and 445 (Figs. '7, 8, and 11) are normally in the disabled positions shown in Fig. '7. Depression of the clear key il (Fig. 13) when neither of the keys H50 01 i5! is depressed, causes energization of the LCC and ECG solenoids by way of the circuits described hereinbefore. These solenoids pull their respective links 458 and 345 towards the right to position the shoulder 443 on each link in the path of a respective stud 436, thereby enabling the clear clutch to pull both links and restore both left and right factor set-up carriages and their arms 32-5 and 350 (Fig. 8) If the right factor lock key lei were depressed, for example, so as to retain the multiplier value in the machine While the left factor is cleared, this key l5! opens the contacts 38'! (Fig. 13) in the circuit through the RC0 solenoid and thus prevents energization of that solenoid and consequently prevents the rightward movement of link 445 (Fig. '7) connected to the right factor carriage arm 35!] (Fig. 8). During the operation of the clear clutch the left factor arm 325 will be restored as described hereinbefore, but the arm 353 being disconnected from the clear clutch by the link 445 will not be restored. 
 As further described hereinbefore, the carriage control mechanism is in the condition shown in Fig. 17 during or after the multiplier is set up. In this condition, the latch 33'! holds the left factor carriage in a disabled half step position, and the latch 353 has released the right factor carriage for movement into an operative full step position, wherein it is subject to control by the numeral keys. same conditions when the multiplication calculation is completed. 
 With the right factor clearance mechanism disabled by the lock key ifil and related mechanism described above, the left factor arm 325 is restored to normal position upon depression of the clear key, During this restoration the camming surface 355a also described hereinbefore, first cams pawl 33! out, and pawl 353 into engagement with the one of the ratchet teeth 352 which is immediately above it. During the extra half step movement of arm 325, the abutment 355 engages the end of pawl 33? and forces it and pawl 353 upwardly and toward the right, thus rocking the right factor carriage 350 a half step back to a disabled half step position, whereupon latch 34l springs into the position shown in Fig. 16 and retains the pawls 331 and 353 in the positions shown in Figs. 8 and 16. Under these conditions the latch 33? is free of the teeth 335 to permit movement of arm 325 to its first full step position shown in Fig. 8 and consequently in condition to be set by the keyboard, while the pawl 353 remains in a position to block one of the teeth 3-52 and theright factor carriage in a half step position, so the latter will not be set by the keyboard. Since the right factor carriage is not re-' stored'under these conditions, the right factor is retained in the right factor indicator while the left factor is cleared by the mechanism described hereinbefore. 
 A converse operation will result from the depression of the left factor lock key lfill, whereupon depression of the clear key will cause clearance of the right factor while preventing clearance of The carriages remain in these the left factor in a manner described in detail in the above mentioned Avery application. 
Last digit ciearing mechanism If the operator makes an error in setting up either factor and wishes to clear either the last one or several of the last digits set up without clearing the entire factor, he may depress the Last digit key 154 (Fig. l), i. e., if he wishes to clear the last digit only he depresses the key and releases it immediately, and if he wishes to clear more than one, he simply holds the key depressed for the period of time required for the machine to clear the two, three, or four digits as the case may be. The arrangement is also such that depression of the Last digit key clears the last digit or digits from the factor indicator which is being set up at the time the key is depressed. 
 The Last digit key 555 (Fig. 23) is mounted for up and down movement on studs 523 and 525 and is normally maintained in raised position by a spring 526. An insulating tip 521 is mounted on the key stem and is adapted, upon depression of the key, to close the contacts 528 of the switch 536. These contacts being normally connected to the main line 382 (Fig. 13) through the normally closed contacts 981, close the circuit through the CC solenoid to ground. As explained in connection with the factor clearing mechanism, this solenoid (Fig. 18) effects engagement of the clear clutch 553, and causes the link 435 to be pulled toward the rear of the machine by operation of I the clear clutch cam 439. The principal difference between the clearing operation and the last digit operation is that the LCC and ECG solenoids (Fig. 13) are not energized during the last digit operation and the studs 434 and 4235 (Figs. 7 and 11) do not engage shoulders 543 (Fig. '7), but instead move into the grooves 53l without actuating the clearing links 440 and M5. The last digit link 460, however, is held toward the left in the position shown in Fig. 8 by a spring 463, to bring the shoulder 532 into the path of stud see so that rearward movement of the latter pulls the link 450 rearwardly. The forward end of this link is connected to a lever 535 pivoted to the frame of the machine at 535 and urged counter-clockwise by a spring 531. Two pawls 538 and 539 (Figs. 15 and 17) pivotally mounted on lever 535 are urged clockwise by springs 54! and 562 and limited in that direction by an ear 553 formed on lever 535. 
 These two pawls are adapted to step their re spective arms 325 and 355 and the left factor and right factor set-up carriages back one step plus a half step overstroke for reasons explained hereinbefore, the pawls being automatically enabled or disabled by the set-up mechanism so that the one associated with the factor indicator being set up is rendered effective and the other ineffective to back step its respective carriage, as follows. The pawls 538 and 539 (Figs. 15 and 17) are formed at right angles, providing lugs 555 and 545, which are adapted to engage the teeth 352 and 336 of the carriage arms 356 and 325, respectively. The latch 33'! has an arm 54? (Fig. 10) also shown in Fig. 15, which lies across the plane of the lug 5 35, and latch 3? has a similar arm 54% which lies across the plane of the lug 555 (Fig. 15). When the left factor indicator is being set up, the parts assume the position shown in Fig. 16, where it can be seen that latch 33? is held counter-clockwise by latch 34], as explained hereinbefore. The 
 342 (Fig. 8) are held in their extreme clockwise position by an arm 53 (Fig. 16) integral with latch 3M, holds ear 544 away from the teeth 352 so the lever ls rocked, the ear 544 slides upwadly along the curved surface of arm 548 without engaging the teeth of the right factor arm 350. 
 When'the right factor is being set up, the reverse condition prevails, namely, the left factor pawl 539 (Fig. 17) is disabled by arm 55? of latch 33'! having been rocked toward the right-as previously described. The right factor pawl 533, at this time, is enabled by arm 548 having been moved toward the left by depression of the X or Neg. X key as expl .lned hereinbefore. 
 If the Last digit key is held down the clear clutch continues to cycle the cam 46!; reoiprocates link 48% (Fig. 16) to back step the carriage as many steps as desired depending upon how long the operator holds the key down. 
 Operation of the clear clutch and rotation of cam 4655 (Fig. 18) during the la-st digit operation serves to perform two coordinated functions: (1) to rock shafts are and 3'85 (Fig. 20) and the arm 433 counter-clockwise and back again, to thereby return the egments 2t! and 358 (Fig. 2) and their respective numeral wheels to their normalized position shown and then to release them for movement to their previously set position, as previously described; (2) to back step the carriage associated with the factor indicator currently being set up, also as previously described, so as to cause the numeral wheel which was last set up to be retained in its normalized or clear position. Assuming, as an example, that the right factor indicator is currently being set up, the arrangement is such that prior to the last digit operation, the ear 13 (Fig. 2) of the right factor carriage 24f; stands approximately one-half step to the right of the next unset order, or one and one-half steps to the right of the order last set up. The amount of (leftward) back step movement necessary for the carriage to accomplish its requi' function therefore, in approx imately equal 'ghtly greater than one and one-half ord During the first half step movement i P ear moves ineffectively past in the above mentioned next 1 or but during the next full step, the ll engages the lug 414 in the next order to the left (the order last set up) and causes counter-clockwise rocking of the arcuate plate 269 in that order. This rocking of the arcuate plate does two things: (1) it rocks the previously set selecting lever 258 counter-clockwise to its normalized position shown; (2) it rethe lat-cl 5 3 which is then free to rock into latching position under urge of spring 279 as described hereinbefore, By means of the coaction of the above mechanism, the latch 218 in the order last set up on y, is enabled to retain itsassoelated arm 2 numeral wheel in their normalized 1 1 shown, whereas the latches in all the other previously set orders are held out of latching position so that when the clear cam (Fig. 18) full cycle position shown, the parts including the numeral wheels and arms 288 (Fig. 2) in all the other orders return to their previously set position. 
 The lateral extension 280a of the arm 28% in the order last set up also rocks the carriage stop lever 295 counter-clockwise in that order, so that when the clear cam returns to its full cycle position and releases the carriage 240 for rightward movement under urge of spring 344, the carriage is permitted to move only a half step rightwardly, after which it is blocked by the stop lever 235 in the order from which the last digit" was just cleared. This rightward half step movement of the carriage moves the ear 4' out of the plane of the lug 414 to permit subsequent rocking of the plate 269, and also moves the levers 251 into alignment with the cars 1268 of lever 258 so that a new digit may be set up in the order from which said last digit was just cleared. 
 The Last digit key is latched down for the greater part of the clear clutch cycle, for various reasons disclosed in the aforementioned Avery patent application in connection with the calculating mechanism, and is released and permitted to rise near the'end of the first and each sueces sive clear clutch cycle. When the LD key is depressed to close the contacts 528 (Fig. 23) and thereby cause engagement of the clear clutch described he-reinbefore an ear 522 on the key stein moves down and beneath a hook on a latch This latch is freely pivoted on shaft 316 and is urged counter-clockwise by a spring 528 so that when the key is depressed the latch snaps over the top of ear 522 to hold the key depressed until automatically released by the following mechanism. An arm 549, also formed on the key stem is effective upon depression of the LD key. to rock lever 492 downwardly, which as described in connection with the operation of the C (clear) key, removes the shoulder 493 (Fig. 21) from in front of the lug 494 so that during the clear clutch cycle the shoulder 50! may move toward the left and drop in front of the car 502 and then return to the right, thereby rocking member ist and shaft 376 clockwise. This shaft has a lever 556 (Fig. 23) fixed thereto, which lever has an car 561 formed across the plane of latch 525, so that clockwise rocking of shaft 316, rocks the latch toward the right from above the ear 522 to release the key. If the operator has also released the key by this time, it will then rise under urge of spring 525, but if the operator should hold the key down, the contacts 528 will be held closed and another clear clutch cycle will follow to clear the next to last digit set up, after which the abovedescribed mechanism will again operate to release the key. If the operator then releases the key it will rise and permit the contacts 528 to open and enable the clear clutch to disengage at the end of its current cycle.
