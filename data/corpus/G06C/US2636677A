 12 Claims. I 
 The invention relates to operation control means for calculating machines and the like and particularly to an improved arrangement for controlling the operation of a plurality of clutch driven mechanisms. More specifically, the invention relates to such control means wherein the position of a shiftable register carriage operates to disable or alternatively enable mechanism for shifting the carriage in sequential relation with a plurality of other sequentially operable clutch driven mechanisms upon manipulation of an operating member, such as a key. 
 The present invention is particularly applicable to control calculating machine operations wherein. one or more ancillary operations are necessary or desirable before the initiation of the main operation. 
 Forexample, in an automatic division operation, it is often necessary to clear'the multiplier quotient register before initiating the operation. 
Also, in many instances, before instituting the division operation it is necessary to shift the register carriage to properly align the dividend set in the product-dividend register with the divisor set in the keyboard. 
 The aforenoted ancillary operations in conjunction with the institution of the division operation are controlled by the devices of the present invention upon operation of an auxiliary clutch which is engaged upon depression of an ment of the carriage to its rightmost position or to a position indicated by a set tabulating stop to properly locate the dividend with relation to the divisor set in the keyboard. Should the carriage be shifted too far to the right, the subsequent division operation will shift the carriage toward the left without effective registration in the quotient register until the dividend is properly aligned with the divisor. 
 The invention has been disclosed as control ling certain ancillary operations in conjunction with the institution of a division operation in a calculating machine constructed and operating in accordance with the disclosure of applicants copending application, Serial No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207. It will be understood, however, that the invention is equally applicable to other types of calculating machines having a plurality of clutch driven mechanisms wherein it is desired to eifect and control their sequential operation. Therefore, it will be apparent that the particular operations performed by the clutch mechanisms are incidental to the operation of the devices of the invention and that the invention resides in means for controlling the initiation of the operations. For subject matter herein disclosed but not claimed, reference is made to applicants copending applications, Ser. Nos. 8.54%, now Patent 2,531,204., 8,547, how Patent 2,531,206 and 8,548, new Patent 2,531,207, wherein such matter is claimed.

Main clutch mechanism The registering and carriage shifting operations of the machine disclosed in my aforenoted copending application, Serial No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207, and to which the invention is shown applied, are performed by power transmitted from a motor i (Fig. 14) through a common main differential clutch mechanism 2 (Figs. 3 and 6). 
 The registering mechanism is connected to the differential clutch mechanism 2 by a normally engaged friction clutch 3 and alternatively the carriage shifting mechanism is connected by engagement of a normally disengaged friction clutch l which is engaged upon disengagement of the registration clutch. 
 The differential clutch mechanism 2 is construet'ed substantially in accordance with the dis-- closure of U. S. Patent 1,566,650; issued on December 22, 1925, to George C. Chase. Normally, 'the gearing comprising both working legs of the differential drive rotate idly as described in the aforenoted patent; interruption of the movement of one leg causing the planet gears to move in their orbit in one direction accordingly rotating output gear 5 (Fig. 6) and interruption of the movement of the other leg causing rotation in the reverse direction. 'The working legs of the differential drive are selectively arrested by means of a clutch lever 5 (Figs. 3 and 5) fulcrumed at the machine left side frame and adjustable to neutral, additive, or subtractive setting. A click pawl it holds clutch lever 6 in its adjusted positions. The two active settings provide for additive and subtractive registration or, alternatively, for right and left carriage shift respective- 1y. Clockwise movement of lever 6 positions it to additive setting whereby a hook arm 7 (Fig. 3) of said lever will engage a lug on gear 3 forming one leg of the diiferential drive to interrupt its movement, thereby causing rotation of output gear 5. Conversely, counterclockwise movement positions lever 5 to subtractive setting whereby a hook arm ia thereof will engage a stop 9 of the other leg of the differential to interrupt its movement and cause rotation of output gear 5 in the reverse direction. 
Carriage shifting mechanism The devices of the invention concern the registering mechanism only in the control of the engagement of main clutch, 2 to initiate its operation. Therefore, the operations performed by main clutch 2 will be considered only in connection with the carriage shifting mechanism which operates in conjunction with the devices of the invention. 
 4 Clutch lever 6 is moved to engage main clutch 2 for additive or subtractive registration upon depression of a plus bar H or a minus bar l2 respectively (Figs. 1 and 11). Alternatively, plus and minus bars I l, i2, are depressed upon depression of a right shift key 13 and a left shift key 7 lerespectively; and concurrentlythe depressed shift key causes the disengagement of registration clutch t and the attendant engagement of shift clutch 5. thereby connecting the carriage shifting mechanism to engaged main clutch 2. 
 The stems of right and left shift keys I3, is (Fig. 11) are provided with shoulders which overlie pins in the stems of plus and minus bars ll, l2 respectively. Therefore, depression of a shift key concurrently will depress the related plus or minus bar ii, i2. The plus bar H and minus bar 12 are connected by links 15 with an arm i6 which is fixed on a rock shaft l'l. Shaft ll extends across the machine and fixed thereon inwardly of the left side frame is an arm l8 (Fig. 14) having coupling connection 19 with asetting plate Setting plate 29 has opposed lugs 2i positioned at opposite sides of a tooth 22 of clutch lever 5. Upon depression of plus bar H or minus bar 52, shaft ii and plate 29 will be rocked in oneor the reverse direction thereby engaging one or the other of lugs 21 with tooth and rocking clutch lever 6 to either itsadditive or subtractive position. Setting plate '20, when released, is normally spring located in'a central position and when in this position, lugs 21 are so spaced from tooth 22 that clutch lever may be moved independently of plate 26, and without interference therefrom, to either of its active positions. Coupling l9 permits plate 23 to be uncoupled from shaft I! so that clutch lever s may be moved, to its neutral position while a plus or minus bar is held depressed. 
 The driving members of registration clutch 3 and shift clutch ii (Figs. 6 and 8) are connected by a sleeve 23 and are thereby longitudinally movable to compress the friction disks of the normally engagedclutch 3 or alternatively the friction disks (not shown) of the normally disengaged cluteh i. Power is transmitted from main clutch 2 for the registering and carriage shifting operations to the driving members of clutches 55 and Q by a gear 26 fixed on the driving member of clutch 1i and engaged by the output gear 5 of main clutch 2. The driven element of shift clutch ii is fast with a gear 25 havingin- :termediate gear connection with a gear 26 fast upon a shaft 27 which carries shift worm 28. A spring urged plunger 29 is mounted on the rear of carriage 3t and engages shift worm 28. Therefore, upon disengagement of registration clutch 3 and the engagement of shift clutch 4, main clutch 2, upon engagement, will drive worm 2'3 to shift carriage 39 one denominational order for each revolution of the worm. 
 Registration clutch 3 is held normally in engagement by a toggle comprising links 5l- 32 (Figs. 6 and 8). Toggle link 32 has fixedpivotal mounting at its right end and link M is pivotally connected at its left end to one end of a lever 33. The other end of lever 33 is connected to the machine frame by a link 3i and antifriction rollers mounted intermediate the ends of lever engage a pair of flanges on sleeve 23 which connects the driving members of clutches 3, spring attached to link as biases sleeve toward the'left, thereby holding clutch 3 engaged under spring tension.

 Should the right shift key I3 or left shift key I! (Fig. 11) be held depressed until the carriage is shifted into either of its extreme positions, shift initiating shaft 39 will be restored to normal and the drive terminated in substantially the same manner as described when shaft 39 is restored upon release of a shift key. For this purpose, two lugs if! (one of which is shown in Fig. 11) are located on the rear of carriage 38 and so spaced that the nose of a plunger H mounted on arm 38 is positioned just below one or the other of said lugs when the carriage is in either of its extreme end positions. Should the carriage be in the extreme right hand position, for example, and the left shift key M depressed, the plunger H which is spring urged to a normal extended position will be depressed by contact with the leftmost lug it when arm 33 is raised and the shift initiated. When the carriage is shifted from the extreme right hand position, the lug ill will be removed from contact with plunger H and said plunger will be spring urged to its extended position. As the carriage is shifted into the extreme left hand position, the side of the nose of the plunger M will be engaged by the rightmost lug H1, thereby moving the plunger and arm 38 toward the rear of the machine against the tension of a spring 52. This movement of arm 38 will remove the shoulder 38' thereof from restraining engagement with the lug of lever ii! allowing said lever and shaft 39 to be spring restored to normal and thus terminate the shift. Upon movement of stop arm M (Fig. 5) to disengage main clutch 2, a pin 6! of the stop arm will engage and disconnect coupling l9 so that setting plate 2% may be spring restored to normal and thus permit clutch lever ii to be moved to neutral posi tion. When the shift key and the related plus or minus bar i i or if is finally released, coupling it will be restored by shaft ill to reengage setting plate 2%. Also, upon release of the shift key, plunger H will drop below lug iii and arm 38 will be urged forward by its spring, thus locating the shoulder til thereof in normal engagement with lever it. 
Tabulating mechanism Carriage tabulating means is constructed and operates substantially in accordance with the disclosure of applicants copending application Serial No. 8,544, now Patent 2,531,204, to which reference is made for the constructional and operational details. 
 The tabulating mechanism comprises a series of settable keys '33 (Figs. 1 and 11) representing the intermediate denominational positions to which carriage 3a is shiftable. The tabulating keys are so constructed that the depression of any key will release any other set keys. Upon depression of a tabulating key 73, a lug H5 at the end of the key stem will be lowered into the plane of the fixed lugs ill which terminate the carriage shift in the extreme end positions. Lugs M operate in conjunction with plunger H in substantially the manner described in connection with the fixed lugs it. However, lugs M are of such configuration that they are effective to terminate the carriage shift in the indicated position upon movement of the carriage therein from either direction. 
 Should the carriage be in a position corresponding to a depressed tabulator key '53, the carriage shift mechanism will operate to shift the carriage from that position to one or the other end positions or to the position corresponding to another depressed tabulator key. This operation is permitted by plunger H which will be depressed by engagement with lug 16 of the depressed tabular key upon initiation of a carriage shift operation. 
Auxiliary clutch operation The auxiliary clutch i5 (Fig. 2) is driven by a gear train 75a from the electric motor 1 and is of well known construction in which a spring urged pawl mounted on the driven member of the clutch is held out of engagement with the driving member by a detent l6, thereby disengaging the clutch. Detent i5 is fixed on a shaft i? which is journalled in the machine framing and is normally held in clockwise clutch disen-- gaging position by a latch 78 (Fig. 9) engaging a shoulder '19 of a slide 19. Slide 19 is held toward the rear of the machine against the tension of a spring 88 by latch 18 and has pivotal connection at its rear to the depending arm of a bell crank 81! (Fig. 3) which is fixed on shaft '31. Upon clockwise movement of latch 78, slide 79 will be released and moved toward the front of the machine by spring 8t, thereby rocking shaft Ti and detent it in counterclockwise direction, thus releasing the pawl of clutch F5 to engage the drive to the motor. 
 As clutch it approaches full cycle position, detent it will be restored to clutch disengaging position by a member driven by the clutch, thereby limiting the operation to a single cycle. To this end, a horizontally disposed arm 82 (Fig. 2) integrally connected with detent 76 is provided at its free end with a cam face 82. When detent i6 is moved counterclockwise to engage clutch 75, the free end of arm 82 will be moved downwardly, thus moving the cam face 82' into position to be engaged by a pin 83 mounted on the driven member of the clutch. As clutch 75 approaches full cycle position, pin 83 will engage cam face 82' and raise arm 82, thereby rocking detent l6 clockwise into position to engage the pawl of the clutch and disconnect the drive when the clutch reaches full cycle position. movement of detent it to clutch disengaging position, shaft Ti and bell crank 81 (Fig. 3) will be rocked clockwise, thereby moving slide 19 to the rear. As clutch 15 moves into full cycle position, pin 83 will pass a slight distance beyond cam face 82 and the movement afforded slide 19 will bring shoulder '79 a slight distance to the rear of latch it (Fig. 9) which will be spring urged into latching position. Slide it will then be spring urged into engagement with latch '18 and arm 82 and detent it will be rocked counterclockwise a slight distance to the position shown in Fig. 2. Should latch 78 be held in slide releasing position until clutch l5 completes its cycle of operation, an auxiliary latch B l will opcrate to engage shoulder 79' of side iii, thus holding detent it in clutch disengaging position. Auxiliary latch 85 has spring connection and common pivotal mounting with latch it. When latch 18 is moved clockwise to release slide '19, auxiliary latch t4 will be spring urged clockwise and thus will be moved into the path of shoulder 19 when slide 79 is restored to the rear. When latch '18 is finally released, it will be spring urged counterclockwise into engagement with auxiliary latch 35, thus moving said latch from engagement with shoulder 19' while at the same time itself moving into latching position to restrain slide 19. During operation of auxiliary clutch it, an- 
interlock operates to prevent movement of clutch Upon lever 6 and to engage main clutch 2'. The interlock comprises the forked free end of the horizontally disposed arm 8| (Fig. 3) of bell crank Bl. When detent 16 is moved to engage clutch 15, the forked end of arm 8! will engage a pin 85 on clutch lever 6, thereby positively holding said lever in neutral position until detent It is restored to disengage auxiliary clutch 75. 
Register clearing operation of the auxiliary clutch Auxiliary clutch 15 may be operated selectively to clear the multiplier-quotient register 86 (Fig. 1), the product dividend register 81, or the keyboard 88. As fully disclosed in applicants copending application, Serial No. 3,547, new Patent 2,531,206, three clear keys are provided, each of which upon depression operates to engage clutch l and to select the clearing operation to be performed. Each of the clear keys is related to a slide respectively and upon depression of any one of the keys the related slide is moved to release latch 78 (Fig. 9) thus engaging clutch l5 and also connecting said clutch with one of a series of drive trains to select the clearing operation. The slides, however, may be moved independently of the clear keys and the devices of: the invention as hereinafter disclosed are adapted to move slide 89 toward the left (Fig. 9) to engage clutch 15 and connect said clutch with a drive train to clear multiplier-quotient register 86. 'Therefore, the operation of clutch is will be described only in connection with slide 89. 
 Slide 89- (Fig. 9) is pivotally supported at its rightmost end to one arm of a bell crank 93 and the leftmost end of the slide abuts an upstanding car it of latch'l8. Therefore, upon movement of slide 89 to the left, latch 73 will be moved to release slide 19, thereby engaging clutch 75 as heretofore described. Upon forward movement of released slide 19, the forward end of said slide will engage a recess adjacent the left end of slide 89 and hold said slide in adjusted position.- 
 Clutch 15 during its cycle of operation will rocka shaft 9! (Figs. 2, 9, and 14) extending across the machine and which upon adjustment of 'slide 89 is connected with a drive train to clear register 85. To this. end, the driven member of clutch 15 is providedwith an eccentric 92 (shown in dotted lines Fig. 2). Eccentric 92 is adapted to impart a'reciprocatory movement to a link 93 which is attached at its forward end to a crank 94 fixed on shaft 9| exteriorly of the left side frame. Thus, when clutch i5 is operated, shaft 9| will be rocked clockwise (Fig. 2) during the first half of the cycle and back to normal during the second half. 
 Slidably mounted on shaft 9i inwardly of the right side frame is a rearwardly extending arm 94 (Figs. 9 and 14) having a pin 95 extending to the left thereof. Integral with arm 95 and positioned to the left thereto is a member 86 provided with an upstanding portion having an open end slot. Further to the left and fixed on shaft Si is a, collar 91 having an arm extending tothe right thereof and engaging the open end slot of member 96. Pivotally mounted on a shaft 98' (Fig. 14) is a lever 99 having at its forward endan open end slot, the bottom of which is defined by an car 99 which is offset to the right (Fig. 9). Normally, the forward end of lever 99 is held downwardly by a finger 97 (Fig. 14) extending rearwardly from the rightwardly extending arm of collar 91, thus locating offset car 99 a slight distance below pin 95. At its rearward edge'slide '89 has slot connection with the rim of member 96. Therefore, when slide 39 is moved to the left, member 96 and connected arm 94 will be moved accordingly, thereby entering pin 95 within the slot at the forward end of lever 99. Thus, when shaft Si is rocked, pin 95 will be rocked accordingly through the connected parts and raise the forward end of lever 89, thereby rocking said lever clockwise (Fig. 14). v The rearward end of lever 93 is pivotally connected to the lower end of a link we which is pivotally attached at its upper end to an arm if)! having bearing in the right side frame and splined on rockahle carriage shaft .102. Therefore, when lever 99 is rocked, link [M will be moved downwardly and rock shaft I02 which through linkage ill?) will likewise rock a shaft m4 extending across carriage 30. Shaft I06, when rocked operates clearout means to return the wheels of register 86 to zero, as, for example, in the manner disclosed in Patent 1,781,320 to L. P. Crosman. As shaft 9| is rocked back to normal, the connected drive train also will be restored and upon movement of latch 78 to engage slide 19, car it of said latch will move slide 89 toward the right to normal position, thereby removing pin 95 from driving engagement with lever 99. 
 Upon each operation of auxiliary clutch 15, the front of carriage 30 is lifted. This operation is necessary to unmesh the intermediate gears in the carriage from the intermediate gears in the machine body during a clearout operation for the dividend-product register 81. This operation is unnecessary in the above-described clearance of multiplier-quotient register 88 or to clear keyboard 88 and is therefore incidental to these operations. However, the carriage lifting operation is utilized in the operation of the devices of the invention to be described. A cam illii (Fig. 2) rotated with the driven member of clutch 75 serves to depress an arm 136 at the beginning of the cycle, thereby rocking a shaft iii! on which said arm is fixed. A pair of arms H18 (Figs. 10, 11, and 15) adjacent the inner faces of the side frames respectively are also fixed on shaft [ill and through means not concerning the invention operate to raise the carriage. As clutch 75 moves into full cycle position, cam will permit a spring H19 (Fig. 11) to restore shaft Hll, thereby lowering the carriage and moving the lifting connections to normal position. 
Main clutch engagement to initiate a division operation As fully disclosed in the aforenoted copending application, Serial No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207, a program of division is initiated upon release of spring impelled mechanism to effect Various essential machine adjustments and to engage main clutch 2 fornegative operation. The spring impelled mechanism is normally restrained by a latch Iii! (Fig. 2) corresponding to part 725 in the copending application and which, according to said copending application, is directly released upon depression of a divide key. Latch H0 is released upon counterclockwise movement and the devices of the present invention thereinaf-ter described utilize power from auxiliary clutch 15 to release said latch in lieu of direct release by the divide key. 
 Latch llfl (Figs. 2, 3, and 5) normally engages a roller at the end of one arm of a crank ill which is fixed on a shaft H2 journalled in the machine side frames extending across the machine. Another crank H3 alsois fixedon shaft H2 and has pivotal attachment to the rear end of a forwardly extending setting arm Ii l. A spring H (Fig. 3) attached to a third crank III; on shaft I52 biases shaft and the parts fixed thereon in clockwise direction. Normally, the parts are held in the counterclockwise position shown in Figs. 2 and 5 by the end of latch member lit engaging the roller of crank Iii. Upon counterclockwise movement of latch H9, its holding end will be removed from the roller of crank I i I and the parts mounted on shaft I I2 will be impelled by spring lit to the clockwise position shown in Fig. 3. 
 Upon clockwise movement of crank I I3, setting arm II i will be moved toward the front of the machine. Upon forward movement of arm II l, an upstanding finger iI l at the forward end of said arm will rock a pivotally mounted plate ill counterclockwise against the tension of a spring Ill from the position shown in Figs. 2 and 5 to that shown in Fig. 3. A hook 3E3 pivoted on plate II'l normally overlies an arm of one link of a toggle HQ IZE Toggle Iill-I2d normally holds a lever iii in counterclockwise position 2 and 5) against the tension of a spring I22. Upon counterclockwise movement of plate i ll, hook 5 I3 will be moved downwardly, thus engaging the arm of toggle link i Iii, thereby breaking toggle II3-i2G and releasing lever I2I which will be rocked by spring I22 to the clockwise position shown in Fig. The clockwise movement of lever iii will operate through one of a pair of setting slides iiii ifid (more clearly shown in Fig. i) in conjunction with a direction control plate I to move clutch lever 5 counterclockwise, thereby engaging main clutch 2 for negative operation in the following manner: 
 Direction control plate I25 is pivotally mounted on a stud in the left side frame near the front of the machine and is adjustable to positive or alternatively negative controlling positions. Normally, plate is spring held incounterclockwise positive controlling position (Fig. 2). However, upon forward movement of setting arm I i i, plate I25 will be adjusted clockwise to negative controlling position (Fig. 3) as fully disclosed in the aforenoted copending application, Serial No. 8,548. The setting slides are positioned adjacently, one behind the other, and have square openings of like size normally aligned at their rear ends with pin 85 of clutch lever 5 extending outwardly therethrough. It will be noted that when the parts are in their normal positions (Fig. 2) pin 85 is centrally located between the front and rear edges which define the openings of slides I23I2 l and that the distance is sufficient to allow adjustment of clutchlever 3 without interference from the slides. 
 Control plate I25 comprises a right wing I25a and a left wing I251). A forwardly extending lug I23 of slide I23 normally is located a slight distance to the right of plate I25 and a lug I24 of slide I25 a slight distance to the left. Lug I23is adapted for engagement with wing IZEia and alternatively lug I24 is adapted for engagement with wing I25b. Lever I2! is connected at its rear end by a pair of diverging links I23'I2l to slides I23-I2 l respectively. When lever I2I is rocked clockwise upon breaking of toggle I Iii-420, link I26 will tend to move link I23 toward the rear of the machine and link I27 will tend to move link i2 l toward the front of the machine. However, the right wing I25a will be adjusted into the path of movement of lug I23 and left wing I252). raised above and out 3) and rearward movement of slide I23 will be prevented. Lug I24, however, will be permitted movement below left wing I251) and therefore slide I25; will be moved toward the front of the machine. Upon forward movement of slide I25, the rear edge of the opening at the rear of said slide will engage pin thereby moving clutch lever 5 in counterclockwise position to engage main clutch 2 for negative operation as shown in Fig. 3. The devices of the invention, to'be described, concern only the control of the en:- gagement of main clutch 2 and reference is made to applicants aforenoted copending application 8,548 for a complete disclosure of the division program initiated upon engagement of clutch 2. 
Initiation of division with preliminary register clearing and carriage position control The devices of the invention in the disclosed embodiment operate in conjunction with a single cycle of auxiliary clutch '15 to institute a program of division. The devices are adjusted to active position upon depression of an operating member comprising asettable divide key I23 (Figs.- 
1, 2, 3, and 5) and operate to engage clutch '15- and to engage operating connections for clearing the multiplier-quotient register 86 by the clutch. If the register carriage is displaced from its rightmost position, the operation'of clutch l5 subsequent to its clearing operation, will institute a rightward carriage shift which will be terminated with the carriage in its rightmost position or in a position indicated by a set tabu-,-- 
lating key I3. Upon termination of the carriage shift, mechanism which is spring charged by clutch 55 but restrained from operation, willbe released and operate to releaselatch H0 to initiate the division program as previously derscribed. If, however, the carriage is in its rightmost position, clutch l5, subsequent to its clears ing operation, will directly releaselatch III? to initiate the division operation. 
In certain instances it may Ice-desirable to in.- I 
stitute the division operation without operation of the preclearing and carriage position control Therefore, disabling means comprising means. a latch I 23 is manually settable to prevent counterclockwise movement of a lever I30(Fig. 10.)- which, when restrained from such movement, 
provides for the operation of clutch I5 for the ward. end to an upstanding arm at the left end of bail I32 (Fig. 5) and extends to the rear of V the machine where it is pivotally mounted on one arm of a bell crank I35. Upon depression of divide key I28, arm I3! and bail I32 will be rocked clockwise from the position shown in Fig. 5 to that shown in Fig. 3, thereby moving link I35 toward the front of the machine. A trip arm I33 is pivotally mounted on link I 3% and is spring urged clockwise (Fig; 5), counterclockwise (Fig. 15), to lower its forward free end into the plane of an 'arm'of a spring'set-latch- I31 (Figs. lO-and- 13 15). Upon forward movement of link I34, the forward endof arm I36 will move latch I31 counterclockwise, thereby releasing a lever I38. 
 As best seen in Fig. 10, lever I38, latch I3! and lever I30 are mounted on suitable supporting and guide plates at the under side of the machine. Levers I39, I38 are connected by a spring 539 which urges each of said levers in counterclockwise direction. Normally, lever I38 is restrained by latch I32 and lever I 30 by engagement with a stud I40 on restrained lever I38. Upon release of latch I31, lever I38 and simultaneously lover I so will be permitted counterclockwise movement by spring I39. 
 A plate I38 is mounted on lever I38 inwardly of the end of its left arm. Upon counterclockwise movement of lever I38, cam plate I33 will engage a depending pin 18a on latch I8, thereby moving said latch to release slide I9. As previously described, released slide 79 will be spring inoved toward the front of the machine to engage auxiliary clutch V5 for a single cycle of operation. Simultaneously with the operation of lever i-ES, a finger 445 (Figs. 9 and on lever $38 by engagement with a pin 8%" of setting slide 89 will move said slide to the left, thereby engaging the clearing connections for multiplierquotient register 86, also as previously described. It will be noted that slide till, by engagement with ear would be effective to release latch IS without the operation of cam plate I However, as hereinafter described, when lever Hill is disabled by latch I29, cam plate l3 must operate to engage clutch I5 withoutmovement of the setting slide, thereby providing for operation of the clutch with the clearing drive disconnected. 
 The first half cycle of clutch iii will rock crank t4 and shaft 9i clockwise (Fig. 2) to effect the register clearin operation as previously v deside frame and spring urged in upward direction, 
is provided with a of lugs I-tfla, I42b, underlying trip Itzl and carriage lifter arm I88 respectively. Arm i4? is normally held in low cred position by the engagement of its lug I421) with lifter arm Iilfl and trip arm I36. is located downwardly in the plane of latch I37 by lug I42a. The spring which biases arm I42 upwardlyis considerably stronger than the spring which holds trip arm I36 in lowered position. Therefore, when carriage lifter arm 28 is raised upon movement of clutch l5 from full cycle position, arm I42 will follow, thereby raising the forward end of trip arm I33 to release latch l-il. Crank 94 has a depending finger extending into the plane of the left end of lever I33 (Figs. 2 and 3). When lever I38 is released from latch I3? and moved clockwise, its left end will move forwardly to a position adjacent the finger of crank 94. Thus, when crank 94- is rocked clockwise, its finger will engage and rock lever its to normal latched position and also lever ltd will be moved to normal by the stud I49 on lever ltd. When carriage lifter arm I08 is lowered as clutch I5 completes its cycle, arm I42 will be moved downwardly therewith, thus permitting trip arm 436 to be lowered and rest upon latch I37. When link I34 is moved to the rear at the conclusion of the division program, 
 T4 trip arm I36 will be spring moved to tripping position at the rear of latch I3l. 
 Clutch I5 in its clearout cycle of operation is, upon adjustment of certain mechanisms, adapted to initiate a rightward carriage shift by depression of right shift key [3. This operation and also the operation of clutch I5 to initiate a leftward carriage shift is fully disclosed in applicants copending application Ser. No. 8,547, now Patent 2,531,286. The adjustments necessary for the right shift initiating operation include the forward setting of a shift direction determining slide I43 and the release of a sprin urged rocker I44 (Figs. .4 and 15). 
 Slide M13 is mounted on suitable studs on the inner face of the right side frame and is adapted for rearward or left shift setting, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15; and for forward or right shift setting. The slide is retained in either of its adjusted positions by a toggle spring and may be in either its forward Or rearward position as a resrdt of a setting in connection with a previous operation. A vertically positioned lever I50 is mounted on the inner face of the right side frame and has at the end of its upper arm a lug engaging slide I43. The lower arm of lever I58 extends downwardly into the path of movement of lever I33 adjacent its right free end. Therefore, when lever I38 is released upon depression of divide key I28 and is moved counterclockwise (Fig. 15), it will engage and move lever I50 counterclockwise. Thus, if slide I43 is positioned to the rear, it will be moved by lever I50 to its forward. or right shift setting. 
 Mounted at the rear and extending downwardly from slide I 43 is a tightly wound spring I45 (Figs. 14 and 15) having its lower end extending through a hole located at the end of an inwardly extending arm of rocker I44. Rocker I 44 is pivotally mounted on a bracket on the outer face of the right side frame, and its inwardly extending arm which has connection with spring I45 passes through an opening in the frame. Rocker I44 is adapted to be rocked in a plane substantially c parallel to that of the keyboard and is biased in one or the reverse direction by spring I45. The spring tends to assume a straightened position and the bias is effected upon setting of slide I43 to displace the top of spring to the front or to the rear. Thus, upon forward setting of slide I43, spring I45 will bias rocker I44 in counter clockwise direction. 
 A lever I4! (Figs. 13 and 15) pivotally mounted on the outer face of the right side frame has a downwardly extending arm which terminates in an inwardly bent portion having slot connection with spring I45 adjacent the inwardly extending arm of rocker I 44. Thus, lever I4! is biased in clockwise direction by spring I45 as rocker I44 is biased in counterclockwise direction. A rearwardly extending arm of lever I4! cooperates with a stop I46 when the carriage is in its rightmost position to prevent movement of rocker I44. 
 Normally, rocker I44 is held in a central position against the bias of spring I45 by a lever I46 (Figs. 11 and 15) mounted outwardly from the right side frame and spring urged in clockwise direction. Lever I45 is provided, at its lower edge adjacent its right free end with a recess I46 which normally engages an outwardly extending arm of rocker I44 thereby holding the rocker in central position. 
 A crank plate I49 has common pivotal mounting with lever I46. One, arm of crank I49extends rearwardly with its end underlying a lug anemone: 
 I 4621 on" lever ME. A second arm of the crank extends downwardly and into the path of move-- ment of the right free end of lever 13 Therefore, upon counterclockwise movement (Fig. of lever i255, its free end will rock crank t lt and lever its counterclockwise (Figs. 11 and thereby releasing rocker its from recess Hit concurrently with the forward setting of slide hi3. 
 As will be later described, the operation of clutch '15 will, with rocker 4M released, be effective to depress right shift key l3. This operation, however, will be effected during the last half cycle of clutch i5. It will be recalled that lever iB is reset durin the first half cycle of clutch l5 and this action would permit reengageinent of rocker i i i by recess 1%. Therefore, latch ng means is provided to hold lever t lt in counterclockwis rocked position. The latching means comprises a pivotally mounted arm i5! (Fig. 11) having an upstanding finger with its end n rmally positioned at the left side 01" lug i i-8o of lever Hit. Arm :5! is biased clockwise by spring connection the right arm of a lever I52 but, however, is restrained by engage-- ment with 9. lug at the end of the arm. Lever i is'sprlllg biased in clockwise direction to engage 2. depending finger l 'ii thereof with the free arm of bell crank til (Fig. 9), the other arm of which is connected to the clearout setting slide as. When slide it is moved to the left to engage the clear out connections as heretofore described, bell crank so will be moved counterclockwise thereby moving lever iii? counterclockwise to release latch arm i. fhereio're, when lever M6 is rocked to release rocker i i-"s, the finger of arm 555 will be moved clockwise beneath lug idea to hold the lever in rocked position. A second latch i524: is operable to hold lever t lt in rocked position in connection with other machine operations not concerning the invention. Therefore, a lug at the end of the 'ight arm of cranlr hit is moved into position to bio I: latching movement of latch lE'Za when the crank and lever let are rocked. 
 The means adjustable by released rocker id l an thereupon operableby clutch l5 U0 depress right shift key it comprises an arm i525 (Figs. ll, l2, l3, and 15) of a power transmission train. Arm I53 has a circuinierentially slotted hub rotata ly and laterally movable on a stud shaft extending outwardly from the right side frame. Integral with the hub of arm 553 is a depending crank Hit (Fig; 12) which has yieldable link connection lilo with an upstanding crank i563 fast on the right end of shaft SI exteriorly of the right side frame. It w ll be recalled that upon operation of clutch shaft 9! is rocked counterclockwise (Figs. 11 and 12) and return. Therefore, arm H53 will be rocked clockwise and return by shaft 92 throughcrank its, link and crank it, upon each operating cycle of clutch l5. 
 A pair of pins l3, E4 (Fig. 13) in the stems of right and left shift keys it and M respectively, extend in aligned and spaced relationship one toward the other. Norm-all ar-in 553 is centrally located between and out of engagement with pins it-it by a pin in a forwardly extending arm of rocker hi l in engagement with the circumferential slot in the hub of said arm E53. Therefore, in the normal operation of clutch l5, arm Hi3 will be idly raised above and then lowered between pins lib-I l. However, upon release of rocker M3 by lever $46, the rocker which is spring biased in counterclockwise direction willmove armiesoutwardly on the stub shaft on which i-t is' sl-ida'bl-y mounted, thus en gaging the outer face of the arm with pi-n l3 of right shift key l3. As arm I53 is raised, it will above pin it and be moved further outwardly and thus into engagement with the stem of shift key l3; Therefore, upon the return downward movement of arm I53, its lower edge will engage pin 13', thereby depressing and holdsl ft key it to effect a rightward carriage shift. 
 As heretofore described, setting slide '89 (Fig. 9) will be restored as clutch l5 completes its cycle, thus releasing latch arm tail of lever 146 through bell crank St and lever 152. However, the outwardly extending arm of rocker M4 in its counterclockwise movem nt will have been positioned to the right and out of alignment with recess i of lever Mt. Therefore, released lever Hi6 will be spring moved a slight distance downwardly to rest upon the outward arm of rocker Hit. The carriage shift will be terminated in the rightmost position or in a position indicated by a depressed tabulating key with shift key I3 held depressed and as an incident thereto, arm 11) will be rocked counterclockwise and return, as previously described. Upon counter clockwise movement of arm 68, an upstanding finger thereof will engage a cam slot at the rear of rocker its, thereby moving the rocker air arzn 252- to central position, thus releasing t it. Furthermore, upon centralization ltd, its outward arm will be moved to dent with recess hi8 thus permitting clockwise movement of lever [43 and the engagement of recess idly" with said outward arm to hold the rocker arm L53 in normal centralized positlon. 
 Should the divide key i228 be depressed with the carriage in a position corresponding to a depressed tabular key 73, the registerclearing operation will initiate a carriage shift which will be terminated in the rightmost position or in a position corresponding to another depressed tabular key. The carriage shift from the position corresponding to the depressed tabular key will be permitted as previously described in connection with the tabulating mechanism. 
 Upon depression of divided key E28, devices of the invention are adjusted into position to be sprin charged by power from auxiliary clutch l5. 
Latching means are positioned upon initiation of the right carriage shift operation to hold the operation of the spring charged mechanism in abeyance. Upon termination of the carriage shift, the spring charged mechanism will be released and thereupon operated to latch H9, thereby initiating the division program as previously described. 
 The spring operated mechanism comprises a crank plate it? and a power transmission plate ifiil (Figs. 2, 3, 1c, 17, and 18) which are included in a second train for transmitting power from clutch iii. Plates it'l -458 have common pivotal mounting on a stud see on the outer face of the left side frame the rear of the machine. Plates l '23l!53 connected by a strong spring which urges the plates counterclockwise and clockwise respectively; the movement being limited by engagement of a stud mi on .plate I51 with a rearward extension of plate I58. A link N52 is pivoted the pivot its of the plate and is supported adjacent its forward end by a pin 53 1' on link i154 extending outwardly through a slot in said link 5132. When divide key i28 is retracted and link at its rear on plate It! below 134 is in normal rearward position (Fig. 16), pin 134' engaging the rear of the slot in link 162 positions said link toward the rear, thereby locating spring connected plates ll155 as a unit in clockwise position. A pin 162' at the forward end of link 162 engages latch 116 and, as will be described, moves forwardly with link 162 to release the latch upon operation of the spring charged mechanism. 
 An arm 161 is pivoted at its rear on transmission plate 156 above stud 156 and extends forwardly with its free end normally below a square stud 81a extending inwardly from the depending arm of bell crank 81. A lever 16s is pivoted on stud 159 to the rear of plate and is urged counterclockwise by a spring 165. Normally, however, lever 16 i is held in clockwise position '(Fig. 16) by a pin 13% on link 13 1 engaging the upper edge of the forwardly extending arm of said lever. Lever 16 1 is provided at the end of its forward arm with an opening 16 1 comprising a reduced or slotted forward portion and an enlarged downwardly extending rearward portion. A pin 163 on arm 163 normally engages the forward slotted portion of opening 511', there-- by locating the free end of said arm in position below stud 61a. 
Upon depression of divide key 128 and the at- 'tendant forward movement of link 1114 (Fig. 1'7), 
pin 134a will be moved away from the forward arm of lever 164. Therefore, lever 164 released from the restraint of pin 134a will be moved counterclockwise by spring 165 and by virtue of the slot and pin connection 163'-16 1, the forward end of arm 163 will be raised into engagement with stud Bid on crank 81. Concurrently with the above movement, detent 16 (Fig. 2) will be moved counterclockwise to engage auxiliary clutch '15 as described. Therefore, shaft 1'1 on which detent '16 is fixed will be moved counterclockwise and crank 31 fixed thereon also will be moved counterclockwise to the dot-dash position shown in Fig. 16. The counterclockwise movement of crank 81 will position stud 81a thereon a slight distance forwardly of a step 163a on the upper free end of arm 163 with the free end of the arm moved upwardly into engagement with the under side of stud 81a. 
 It will be recalled that detent '16 and crank 61 are restored clockwise just before the end of the cycle of clutch '15 by engagement of pin 63 on clutch with arm 62 of the detent. However, before this clutch disengaging movement of detent 16, right shift keyjS will have been depressed by the action of clutch '15 and therefore toggle 313.l will be broken to initiate the right carriage shift. The breaking of toggle 31-32 will operate to position a latch arm 166 (Fig. 6) to hold in abeyance the operation of the main clutch enging mechanism which will be spring charged by the movement of crank 61 clockwise to normal. 
 Arm 166 has common pivotal mounting with a bell crank 16'! at the lower rear of the machine. 
 One arm of crank 16! extends upwardly and has spring 160 will be tensioned. 
' 18 its free end with slot 151' of plate 151'. (Fig. 17.) 
 When crank 81 is moved clockwise upon movement of detent '16 to clutch disengaging position, lug 81a of the crank will engage step 163a, thereby moving arm 163 toward the rear and rocking transmission plate 158 counterclockwise. Crank plate 15? will be restrained from movement with plate 158 by arm 166 and therefore Upon conclusion of the carriage shift and the consequent resetting of toggle 31-32, crank 16'! and arm 166 will be restored counterclockwise, thereby releasing crank plate 151. Therefore, released plate 151 will be moved in counterclockwise (Fig. 18) direction by spring 1611. counterclockwise movement of plate 151 will move link 162 toward the front of the machine and pin 562' thereof will move latch 1111 counterclockwise to initiate the division program in accordance with the referred to copending application, Serial No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207. 
 It will be noted that plate 152 is provided with a cam edge to the rear of slot 151' for the purpose of positively guiding arm 155 into engagement with the slot. Upon counterclockwise movement of plate 151, arm 166 will be moved upwardly by the cam edge which movement is allowed by the yield of the spring of the arm. Furthermore, upon counterclockwise movement of plate 157, stud 151 thereon will engage the extension of plate 156 and ti ertia of the parts will afford a slight further counterclockwise movement of the parts, including plate 158. Therefore, arm 163 will be moved a slight distance further to the rear, thereby moving step 163a from engagement with stud 81a. Pin 163' in the rearward movement of arm 163 will have been moved from the forward slot portion to the rear downwardly extending portion of opening 164 of lever 16 1. Arm 163 released from frictional restraint by engagement of step 163a with stud 81a and from the slot portion of opening 164' will be free to drop by gravity to the position shown in Fig. 18. 
 Divide key 126 is held alternatively in its retracted and depressed positions by a toggle spring (not shown) The division program is terminated upon automatic retraction of divide key 128 upon shifting of the carriage into its leftmost position or retraction of the divide key by manual depression of a stop key (not shown). These operations, however, bear no relation to the invention and are fully disclosed in the aforenoted application, Serial No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207. 
 Upon retraction of divide key 126, link 13 1 will be moved toward the rear and pin Lida thereof will depress lever 164 to normal. Stud 134' on link 134 will engage the rear of the slot in link 162, thereby moving said link 162 toward the rear of the machine and plates 15ll56 as a unit clockwise to normal. Upon clockwise movement of plate 158, arm 163 will be moved forwardly and pin 163' thereof will ride upwardly on the inclined forward edge of the downwardly extending portion to the slotted portion of opening 16 1, thereby locating the arm in its normal position, as shown in Fig. 16. Pin 162' upon rearward movement with link 162 will permit resetting of latch arm 11B and also effect other adjustments (not shown) which will terminate the division program. Pin 162' is related to the division controlling mechanism in the same manner as pin T22 of the aforenoted copending application, No. 8,548, now Patent 2,531,207, to which reference has been made for the operation of the division program, 
Disablement of carriage shift initiating means If divide key I28 is depressed with the carriage in its rightmost position, the clearing operation of clutch I5 Will be inefiective'to initiate operation of the carriage shifting mechanism and the 'main clutch engaging mechanism will be operated without delay by movement of auxiliary clutch detent it to clutch disengaging position. The means operable to disable the carriage shift initiating mechanism comprises stop M6 and lever It? (Figs. Hand Stop I46 is mounted on the right end of a slide I68 which extendsoutwardly from the right side frame. Slide I 68 extends across the machine and also extends outwardly'from theleft side frame. When the carriage is in any of its intermediate positions, slide I68 and stop I46 are yieldably located in a centralized position (Fig. 15) :by a 
'pair of spring centralizing devices 569. The end of the rearward arm of lever I41 extends between a'pair of depending fingers of stop I45 and when the stop is in centralized position lever I47 is permitted movement in either direction. However, when the carriage is in its rightmost position, a lug I'Iil on the-inner face of the left end plate of the carriage will engage and displace slide IE3 and stop I66 to therig'ht. In this position of stop M6, a lug at theend of the left finger thereof will be moved beneath the rear arm of lever I i! thus blocking the lever from clockwise movement. Therefore, when rocker use is released by lever 36 upon depression of the divide key, the lower end of spring Hi5 will be restrained from forward'movement by lever i l? and will thus be ineffective to move rocker Hi l counterclockwise. Arm I53 therefore will not be displaced laterally and will be ineffective to initiate operation of the carriage 'shift mechanism upon operation of auxiliary clutch '15. Upon conclusion of the clearing operation of clutch i5, latch arm I5I will release lever I46 to reengage recess I46 with rocker I44 as previously described. 
 Latch arm lfifi'tFig. 16) is normally ineffective to restrain crank plate I51. Therefore, as arm I63 is moved to the rear'by crank 8I, plates ISL-I58 will be moved counterclockwise as a unit thereby moving link- I62 forwardly to cause operation of the main clutch engaging mechanism without delay. It will be recalled that there is a slight reverse movement of detent '16 after its clockwise movement to disengage clutch 15. This reverse movement will move stud 8Ia of crank 81 from'engagement with step ISSci of arm [63 thereby. permittingdownwa'rd movement of the arm'by gravity to the position shown in Fig. 18. 
Disablement of register clearing and carriage shift initiating mechanisms Manual setting latch I29 to clockwise position as shown in Fig. 2 provides for the disablement of the means to connect the register clearing mechanism with clutch I5 and also to render the operation of the clutch ineffective to institute a carriage shift as follows: 
 Upon counterclockwise movement (Fig. 10) of lever I38, latch 529 willprevent like-movement of lever I36. Finger MI of lever I3Bwill therefore be ineffective to move slide 89 to the left to engage the clearing train. Lever I46 (Fig. 11) will be moved to release rocker Hi4. However, crank 98 (Fig. 9) connected to slide 89 will not be moved. Therefore, lever I 52 will be held in clockwise position thereby maintaining lat-chlbl :in disabled position. Lever 33 is restored during the first half cycle of clutch is and before arm E53 (Figs. 11 and i2) is rocked above pins l3'l 5' of shift keys 53-441. Rocker its ispermitted very little movement upon release until arm I53 is raised above pins i3 Thus, lever I49 will be restored to reengage recess lit with rocker M l to permit idle downward movement of arm 653 between pins l3'-l 'l. The main clutch engagement therefore will be effected directly byoperation of auxiliary clutch it without a register clearing operation and without the interposition of a carriage shift, regardless of the position of the carriage. 
 Although the invention has been disclosed in the control of particular ancillary operations in conjunction. with the institution of a program of division, it will be apparent that the invention is equally applicable where it is desired to effect the sequential control of other clutch driven operations a calculating machine. It will beunderstood therefore that theinvention is not to-be restricted, except as necessitated by the spirit of the appended claims.
