 Claims. (Cl. 235-60) This application relates to adding machines and more particularly to improvements in the indexing, driving, and printing mechanisms thereof to increase the speed of operation and to simplify the construction of such machines. 
 Ten key adding machines are well known and have been commercially produced for many years. In general such machines are satisfactory but operate slower than is desirable in modern office machines and cannot be appreciably speeded up without being subject to occasional errors and excessive wear. The present embodiment of an adding machine is designed to eliminate the sources of such occasional errors due to speed and to reduce or eliminate so far as is possible the factors requiring high factors of safety in timing tolerances with the result that the present machine can be safely cycled at speeds up to twice those of present machines. 
 It is an object of this invention to design an adding machine having as many as possible of the main operating parts operable by power rather than by springs so that no cycling time need be allowed as tolerance. 
 It is also an object of the invention to provide an adding machine in which theoperated parts are driven by a rotary drive mechanism and without shock, thus avoiding wear due to high speed impacts between the parts. 
 A further object is to provide a key indexing mechanism which is suitable for operation by the fastest operator. 
 Another object is to develop a key indexing mechanism in which any key may be depressed before another is released and in which each key completes its function while it is being depressed. 
 A similar object is the provision of a touch tuning device for such a keyboard by which the force required to depress a key may be varied at will to suit .the preferences of different operators. 
 A further object is to provide a differential mechanism controlled by the key indexing mechanism and operated by power both to and from a home position, thus eliminating rebound tendencies found in spring driven devices. 
 Still another object is to disclose a differential mechanism for an adding machine in which the arrest of the differential mechanism resets the set pins in a pin carriage so that it is unnecessary to return the pin carriage past its home position to reset the pins, thereby saving time and enabling faster operation. 
 An object auxiliary to the above is to provide a simple item repeat mechanism to prevent such pin resetting by the differential mechanism without change in the arresting function of the pins. 
 It is also .an object of this invention to develop a simple rotary control mecahnism to shift the register into mesh with the differential mechanism in item entering, subtotal, and total operations. 
Another object is the provision of a simplified total taking mechanism which does not require an idle stroke to restore any set transfer devices. 
 A part of the object above is .the development of a transfer mechanism of the extra step of the differential mechanism type which may be reset before the differential mechanism is restored to a 0 position so that the reset part may be utilized in total taking. 
 A different object is in the provision of a simplified printing mechanism using a solid printing type member piovted on the differential mechanism bars. 
 A further object is in the design of power driven control members which are released by operation of a control key to set the function control parts by power and to initiate a machine cycle, thus lightening the pressure required to operate a control key and making the touch of all control keys uniform. 
 Still another object is the provision of a subtraction control for the adding machine register which control acts to sense either the position of the subtraction control key or the overdraft condition of the register at each machine cycle and is controlled to sense the one or the other by the indexed or non-indexed condition of the indexing mechanism. 
 A separate object is the development of a unitary inked ribbon feeding and ribbon vibrating mechanism which is cam driven and automatically adjustable into either a red or black ribbon position. 
 A further object is the provision of an item correction mechanism to correct an erroneous entry by restoring any set pins during a machine cycle in which the differential mechanism is prevented from moving to a printing position and the printing and platen line space drives are held ineffective. 
 Other objects conducive to the reduction of machine parts and to the increase of operating speed which are not particularly pointed out above will be in part obvious and in part specifically pointed out in the following description and accompanying drawings of a preferred embodiment of my invention.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION The embodiment described in application is a printing adding machine designed for relatively high speed and in which positive movements to reduce the timing tolerances common to spring operated devices are utilized as far as is practical. The driving mechanism is rotary to eliminate the complexity involved in an oscillatory type where some parts must be operated in only one direction of movement, or sometimes in opposite directions at different times. A rotary drive mechanism also enables all of the main power parts to be placed in a line and simplify assembly and repair in addition to reducing the number of parts used. 
 The rotary drive is controlled by a number of cycle keys, each of which releases a spring driven slide to set the function controls and starts a motor cycle to actuate the machine. Such a construction lightens the Work load on the keys and permits the function keys to be operated by a uniform pressure, not radically diiferent from that required for the digit indexing keys. 
 The digit keys, 10 in number for a decimal machine, each operate to set a stop pin in a traveling pin carriage and all keys act through a common connecting member to simultaneously set the topmost or 9 pin which is, in addition to being a stop for a differential member, also the stop for an escapement mechanism so that the pin carriage is released for an indexing step when any key is operated. The pin setting connections from each key are driven by a displacea'ble lever connected to the digit key and shifted to an inoperative position as the key depression is completed. The connections then fully restore and a second digit key may be operated during return of the first key or even if the first key stays depressed. Such -a construction enables the indexing of an item as fast as the operator can depress the keys. 
 After an amount is indexed and a machine cycle started, the differentially moved actuator bars are positively raised to contact the set stops. The set stop will then arrest the actuator bar and continued movement of the actuator bar drive member will disconnect it from the actuator bar and lock the bar in its set position. 'In its further movement the drive member will reset the set index pin and the 9 pin to their original positions in the pin carriage so that at the mid cycle point all of the pins have been reset. The pin carriage may now be restored to its home position and since no stops are to be reset during such movement, there is no need for the usual restoration of the carriage through the home position to reset the last row of stops and then a return movement of the carriage to the home position. Consequently as soon as the actuator bars and drive members are restored to their 0 position, the keys may be reoperated to set a new amount during the remaining part of the machine cycle. 
 When it is desired to repeatedly enter the same amount, a repeat key is operated to cause the pin carriage to be shifted just far enough to shift the stops out of alignment with the drive members so that the stops are still effective to arrest the upward movement of the actuator bars but are not reset by the drive members. 
 The printing of an indexed amount is done by a group of type blocks, one connected to each actuator bar for setting to a printing position with reference to a platen. As the drive members raise the actuator bars, they simultaneously move a hammer restoring bar from a group of printing hammers which, however, remain cocked until the drive members are raised to their highest position where such hammers as are to fire are released to drive their type blocks against the platen. The hammers are restored to a latched position by the drive members during their restoration. 
 A register is selectively engageable with either of two groups of rack bars connected to the actuator bars to enable additive or subtractive entry of an indexed amount into the register during the return of the actuator bars to their normal position. A transfer device controlling each rack will normally stop each rack at a 0 position but is operable by the register wheel of the next lower denomination to release the rack for an extra, tens transfer, movement. The register is also engageable with the racks at the position during their upward movement and will be rotated backwardly until the register wheels are individually arrested by the tens transfer devices to stop the type blocks at total printing positions. As the transfer device to arrest the wheels in total cycles may have been released on a preceding cycle, these devices are reset prior to the engagement of the register with the racks at the 0 position and therefore, the transfer stop on the racks is made yieldable to avoid interference. 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION Machine cycling mechanism (Figs. 3, 4, 5, A, 11, 12, 22, 26, 27, and 39) All of the functions of the machine are powered by a group of three concentric rotary shafts 41, 42, and 43, Figures 5 and 5A. The middle shaft 42 is rotatable in bearings in the right machine sidewall 45 and in the left sidewall 46. Secured to the right end of shaft 42 is a repeat cam 47, see also Figures 4 and 39, having a crank pin 49 with a cam roller 50 rotatable thereon, fixed to the repeat cam 47. Secured to the left end of shaft 42 is a key lock cam 52 with a crank arm 51 and cam roller 53 mounted thereon similar to those on cam 47. 
 Shaft 43 is rotatable in a right auxiliary frame 54 secured to the right sidewall 45 and has secured thereto a subtract cam 55 at its left end, see Figures 12 and 22, and a cycle restore cam 57, at its right end, see also Figure 26. Subtract cam 55 has a hole near its periphery to receive the squared end of crank pin 49 to couple the shafts 42 and 43 together for rotation. 
 Slidable but not rotatable on the middle portion of shaft 43 is a collar 58, Figures 5, 11, and 14 to 21, having a disengage cam 59 and a total cam 61 either formed as a part of the collar 58 or secured thereto. 
 The left shaft 41 is freely rotatable in a left auxiliary bracket 62 secured to the left sidewall 46 and has secured to it at its inner end, a pin carriage restore cam 63 having a square hole to receive the end of crank pin 51, see Figure 5A. Fixed to the left end of shaft 41, Figure 27, is a clutch plate 65 having a. clutch dog 66 pivoted thereon and urged clockwise by a spring 67 between the dog 66 and plate 65. Freely rotatable on shaft 41 between clutch plate 65 and sidewall 46 is a pulley 69 having a toothed hub 70 with which clutch dog 66 is engageable under the pull of spring 67. A second pulley 71 free on a stud 73 in bracket 62 is connected to pulley 69 by a belt 74 and is secured to a third pulley 75 driven by a belt 77 connected to any suitable power source, as an electric motor. 
 The three shafts 41, 42, and 43 rotate as a unit due to the interconnecting crank pins and in effect constitute a single shaft which may, unless particularity is required, be hereinafter referred to as the main shaft of the machine. A cycle of operation of the machine consists of one revolution of shafts 41, 42, and 43 and may be initiated by operation of any one of the function control keys to be later described. 
 When any control key is operated, it causes the lower ends of the arms 78 and 82, Figure 27, secured to a shaft 79 near the front of the machine, to be moved rearwardly. A link 81 secured to an arm 82 at the left end of shaft 79 is thereby moved rearwardly to move the upper end of a clutch stop lever 83 pivoted on a stud 85 in auxiliary plate 62 and connected at its lower end to link 81, from under the tail of clutch dog 66. Spring 67 then pulls dog 66 clockwise into the teeth of the pulley hub 70 to enable pulley 70 to rotate clutch plate 65 and the main shaft clockwise. 
, Near the end of the cycle of the main shaft, the cycle wardly. -Arm 87 is slotted at its rearend to slide on shaft 43 and is pivoted at its front end to an arm of a yoke 89 pivoted on a rod 90 in a bracket 91 fixed to a second bracket 92 secured between sidewall 45 and the right auxiliary frame 54. An inner arm of yoke 89 is connected by a link 93 having an inverted L slot to a pin 94 on the right arm 78 of shaft 79. A spring 95 connected to link 93 serves to hold the link clockwise in Figure 26 and tensioned toward the rear of the machine with pin 94 in the lower end of the slot in the arm. When link 87 is moved forwardly by cam 57, it will, through yoke 89 and link 93 rotate shaft 79, arm 78, Figure 26, link 81 and clutch stop lever 83 back to their normal positions where lever 83 will intercept clutch dog 66 at the end of the machine cycle and pull the dog out of engagement with hub 70 to terminate the cycle. Clutch plate 65 is prevented from rebounding when arrested by stop lever 83 by the engagement of a detent lever 97 pivoted on stud 85, with a notch in the periphery of plate 65. A spring 98 connected between stop lever 83 and detent lever 97 urges the levers counterclockwise and clockwise respectively to hold their other arms against a stop 99 fixed in bracket 62 and thereby retain them in their effective positions against the clutch dog 66 and clutch plate 65. 
Indexing mechanism (Figs. 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 29-32) Amounts to be entered into the adding machine are indexed by setting stop pins in a shiftable pin carriage by operation of a set of digit keys. The digit keys 100, Figures 1 and 2, are vertically slidable in slots in the top and bottom keyboard plates 101 and 102 secured to right and left keyboard sidewalls 104 and 105 respectively, see also Figure 29, fixed between forward extensions of the machine sidewalls 45. and 46. Pivoted in the sidewalls 104 and 105 are a plurality of bell cranks 106, one for each key 100, each bell crank 106 having a forward arm positioned under a shoulder of its key 100. A downward leg of each bell crank is connected to the forward end of a slide 108 slidable at its rear in a bracket 109 and having an ear projecting to the right through a slot in sidewall 104, Figure 29. A spring 110 connected between the ear of each slide 108 and a common plate 112, Figure 32, slidable on a stud 113 in sidewall 104 acts to move each slide 108 forward and holds its key 100 in an upper position. 
 The plate 112 is slidable to vary the tension exerted by the springs 110 on the slides 108 and to therefore adjust the pressure required to depress the individual keys 100. As shown in Figure 32, plate 112 is connected to one arm of a lever 114 pivoted on sidewall 104. The other arm of lever 114 is engaged by the end of a screw 116 held in a threaded hole in top plate 101 and having a head 117 for manual adjustment. As screw 116 is rotated to rock lever :114 clockwise, the plate 112 is moved forwardly to increase the pull of springs 110 which will increase the pressure required to depress the keys 100. A reverse rotation of screw 116 will reduce the key pressure and thus each machine operator may adjust the keyboard touch to her own preference. 
 Pivoted near the rear end of each slide 108 is a lever 118 having its right arm connected by a spring 120 to the ear of its slide 108 to normally hold the lever in its clockwise position of Figure 29. A left arm of lever 118 is spaced in front of a bracket 121 fixed to bottom plate 102 and a rear arm of each lever 118 is in front of a pin setting slide 122 slidable in bracket 109 and another bracket 124 on bottom plate 102. Each slide 122 except the topmost one for the 9 key 100 has an ear positioned in front of a universal bar 125 fixed in a bail 126 which is pivoted on a screw 128 in bottom plate 102 and tensioned clockwise in Figure 29 by a spring 129. The topmost slide 122 has a slotted ear embracing the top end of universal bar 125 and is not contacted by the rear arm of the lever 118 for the 9 slide 108, see Figure 30, but rather, the arm of lever 118 will contact a forward ear of bail 126 to rock the bail and thereby operate pin setter 122. Thus the top pin setter 112 will be operated when any key 100 is depressed. 
 As a slide 118 is moved rearwardly by depression of a key 100, the rear arm of lever 118 moves the aligned slide 122 with the slide 108 until the left arm of lever 118 contacts the bracket 121. Further movement of slide 108 causes lever 118 to rotate counterclockwise about bracket 121 and moves the end of the rear arm of lever 118 to the left out of engagement with the ear of slide 122 as indicated in Figure 31 where the arm of lever 118 is shown as just ready to leave slide 122. A slight additional movement of slide 108 will cause slide 122 to be released from lever 118 for immediate return to its normal position by bail 126 and spring 129. A second key 100 may now be depressed to operate a second slide 122 and will not be interfered with by the previously operated key 100 which will be restoring to the normal position. Thus the slide 122 will be fully operated and released during the depression of a key 100 and an operator need not wait for restoration of a depressed key before operating a second key. 
 Immediately to the rear of the slides 122 is a stop pin carriage having a plurality of columns of pins with 10 pins in each column. The pin carriage as best seen in Figure 7, comprises a back plate 130, left, central, and right walls, 132, 133, and 134 respectively and a front plate 136 between the central wall 133 and the right wall 134. The rear wall 130 has two grooved rollers 137, only one being shown in Figure 7, and two cylindrical rollers 139 on its upper edge which rollers 137 roll on a rod 138 fixed in a slidable frame 140 to support the pin carriage for sliding in the frame 140. Frame 140 passes through holes in the sidewalls 45 and 46 and is free to move slightly therein between positions wherein one of a pair of brackets 141 secured to its top surface and having holes through which pass pins 142 secured to the sidewall 45 or 46, abuts the adjacent sidewall. Additionally an car 144 on each sidewall 45 and 46, see Figure 5, passes through a slot in the bottom of frame 140 to hold the bottom of frame 140 against front to back movement while a spring 145 connected between frame 140 and sidewall 45 urges frame 140 to its rightmost position. A roller 146 on the front plate 136 of the pin carriage, see also Figure 7, passes through a slot in the lower surface of frame 140 to guide the bottom of the pin carriage, 
 A plurality of pins 148 arranged in columns of ten pins each are slidable in slots in the pin carriage back plate 130 and in a guide plate 149' fixed to the front plate 136. These pins 148 are settable from a normal forward position to a rear position and are held in either position by a wire detent 150, see Figure 8. The pin carriage is urged to the left in frame 140 by a spring 152 connected between the left side of frame 140 and the pin carriage wall 134 but will be held in position by the engagement of an escapement lever 153 on frame 140 with an unset pin in the top row of pins 148. Escapement arm 153 is pivoted on a bracket 154 secured to the top of frame 140 and is tensioned clockwise by a spring 156 to hold its upper arm against a lug bent rearwardly from bracket 154. 
 The original position of the pin carriage will be as shown in Figure 7 with the upper left pin 148 engaged by escapement arm 153 and in this position, the left row of pins 148 will be directly behind the rear ends of the pin setters 122, Figure 29. When any key 100 is depressed, it moves rearwardly the associated pin setter 122 as above set out and for any digit key to 8, will also move rearwardly the top pin setter 12 2. Such pin setter movement will shift the aligned pin 148 rearwardly to a set position and for the top pin 148 will move the pin rearwardly out of engagement with escapement arm 153, Figure 7, 
to free the pin carriage to the action of spring 152, which will move the pin carriage to the left until escapement arm 153 engages the next pin 148. As subsequent keys are operated, the pin carriage is repeatedly stepped leftward as above to move the columns of pins 148 which have had stops set therein from alignment with the pin setters 122. 
Back spacing mechanism (Figs. 3, 7, 7A and 8) When an incorrect digit key 100 is operated, it is necessary to restore the incorrectly set pin 148 and to move the pin carriage one step to the right. A back space key 157, Figure 3, slidable in upper and lower keyboard plates 101 and 102 and urged upwardly by a spring 158 carries a stud 160 engaged in a slotted arm of a bell crank .161 pivoted on the keyboard sidewall 105. The lower arm of bell crank 161 is pivotally connected to a link 162 extending rearwardly and connecting to a lever 164, Figures 7 and 7A, pivoted on frame 140. As key 157 is depressed, link 162 is pulled forwardly to pivot lever 164 clockwise until it is arrested by a stop 165 on frame 140. During such movement of lever 164, a pawl 166 pivoted on the left arm of the lever 164 and tensioned by a spring 168 will engage in the teeth of a rack 169 and move the rack to the right. Rack 169 is secured to the bottom of the pin carriage and will carry the pin carriage with it a distance slightly greater than the horizontal distance between the centers of two columns of pins 148. Also during the movement of lever 164, its left arm contacts a link 170 pivoted at its right end on an arm of a resetting plate 172 and slidable at its left end on a stud 173 on frame 140. Plate 172 is pivoted on a post 174 fixed in frame 140 and will be swung counterclockwise by arm 164 acting through link 170. A spring 176 connected to plate 172 normally holds plate 172 in a clockwise position with the right end of the slot in link 170 against stud 173. There is a small clearance between the arm of level 164 and the left end of link 170 so that lever 164 through pawl 166 and rack 169 will have partially moved the pin carriage to the right before plate 172 is moved, thus insuring that the column of pins having the incorrect digit set therein shall be in front of plate 172. Plate 172 is moved to the position shown in Figure 8 and will reset all pins 148 including the top pin, in the column last indexed by a key 100. When the back space key 157 is released, springs 176, 168, and 158 restore the back space parts to their normal positions releasing the pin carriage which then moves to the left to abut escapement arm 153 by the reset top pin 148, thereby returning the pin carriage to the condition it was in prior to the depression of the incorrect digit key 100. 
Denominational actuators (Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 33-35) After an amount has been indexed by setting pins 148 in the pin carriage, the set pins 148 are used to control the vertical excursion 'of a set of actuator bars 177. Each actuator bar 177 is vertically movable to the rear of the pin carriage plate 130 on a guide bar 178, which is in a slot in each actuator bar 177, and have rearwardly extending tails guided in slots in a comb 180 between sidewalls 45 and 46. The actuator bars 177 are spaced apart a distance equal to that between the columns of pins 148 and are positioned so that as any column of pins 148 is released from escapement arm 153, the step of the pin carriage will bring that column into lateral alignment with the rightmost actuator bar 177. Each actuator bar 177 has a foot extending forwardly from its lower end into vertical alignment with any set pin 148 and each bar 17 7 is notched with a plurality of notches at its upper front edge. 
 An actuator carriage 181 is vertically movable between the pin carriage and actuator bars 177 and has rollers 182 at each end, see Figures 3 and 4, by which it is guided in slots in plates 184 fixed to each sidewall 45 and 46. A 
shaft 185 passes through carriage 181 and extends through the slots in plates 184 to further guide the carriage 181. Freely rotatable on shaft 185 are a plurality of drive levers 186, see Figures 1 and 3335, one to the right of each actuator bar 177 and each having a lower inverted Tshaped arm and an upper arm carrying an aligner actuator 188 pivotally connected thereto. A spring 189 connected between a lower arm of the actuator 188 and carriage 181 acts to hold actuator 188 clockwise in Figure 1 to normally press its arm against a pin 190 in its drive lever 186 and simultaneously to urge the drive lever 186 counterclockwise to hold a roller 192 at the lower rear of lever 186 in a notch in the front edge of an aligned actuator bar 177. 
 As carriage 181 moves vertically, the actuator bars 177 are carried along with it due to the engagement of rollers 192 in the actuator bar notches until the foot of the actuator bar 177 strikes an aligned set pin 148. Further movement of carriage 181 and actuator drive lever 186 cams lever 186 clockwise as shown in Figure 33 to move roller 192 out of the notch, freeing the actuator bar 177 from carriage 181. Just to the left of each actuator bar 177 is an aligner lever 193 pivoted on a fixed rod 194 in sidewalls 45 and 46 and having an aligning stud 196 fixed in its upper end. The lower arm of each aligner lever 193 is normally engaged by roller 192 to hold the aligner lever 193 in the position of Figure 1 but when roller 192 is cammed out of the actuator bar notch, the aligner actuator 188 engages the upper arm of lever 193 as shown in Figure 33 to rock the lever 193 clockwise and engage the aligner stud 196 in one of the notches in the upper edge of bar 177 as shown in Figure 33. 
 As roller 192 leaves the actuator bar notch, the forward end of the lower arm of lever 186 will be positioned under the set pin 148 which arrested the actuator bar 177 and upon further upward movement of carriage 181 will cam the pin 148 back to an unset position as shown in Figure 34. Drive lever 186 will remain in the rocked position with roller 192 running along the front edge of actuator bar 177 for its remaining vertical movement during which movement the top pin 148 will be reset to its initial position by drive lever 186 in the same manner as the lower pin 148. Thus as the carriage 181 reaches its upper position, all set pins 148 have been reset and all actuator bars 177 are held by studs 196 in an aligned position corresponding to the pins which arrested their upward movement as shown in Figure 35. During the return movement of carriage 181 to its lower position, drive lever 186 will first move freely until roller 192 moves into the actuator bar notch under the action of spring 189 and rocks the aligner lever 193 back into its Figure 1 position to free the actuator bar 177. The drive arms 186 then carry the actuator bars 177 downwardly with carriage 181 to the original position as in Figure l. 
 The above movements are given carriage 181 by a pair of identical cam arms 197, see Figures 3 and 4, each pivoted outside one of the sidewalls 45 or 46 on a stud 198 and having a cam opening surrounding the roller 50 on the crank pins 49 described as part of the main shaft. The front end of each cam arm 197 is connected by a link 200 to an end of shaft 185 of the carriage 181. A link 201 connects each cam arm 197 to a ribbon lift lever 202 also pivoted on sidewalls 45 or 46 and to be later described, which levers 202 are urged counterclockwise in Figure 3 and clockwise in Figure 4 by springs 204, see also Figure 3A, to assist the hereinafter described rack bar springs in holding cam arm 197 up against roller 50. After a short dwell period of approximately 30 rotation of the main shaft after a machine cycle is started, roller 50 frees the cam arm 197 to move the carriage 181 and actuators 177 up to approximately a position. After a short dwell of cam arm 197 at the 0 position, roller 50 starts to drive the arm to lift carriage 181 to its highest extent and difierentially position actuators 177 as above described. Just before a mid-cycle position, carriage 181 reaches its upper position and dwells there for a short interval. Continued motion of roller 50 returns cam arm 197 and carriage 181 to restore the actuators 177 during the next quarter cycle to their normal position wherein they will be held by roller 50 during the last quarter cycle. 
Non-indexed 0 stop (Figs. 7, 9, l0, and 40) Most of the items to be indexed in the pins 148 will have fewer denominations than the number of actuators 177 so that certain of the left side actuators will not have a stop pin 148 in arresting position. To prevent such actuators 177 from rising above their inactive 0 position, a 0 stop plate 205, Figure 7, is provided between the Walls 132 and 133 of the pin carriage. This stop plate 205 is in alignment with the bottom row of pins 148 and is slidable between an actuator arresting position and a reset position. A plate 206 is pivoted between pin carriage walls 132 and 133 above stop plate 205 and has two ears engaging in slots in plate 205 to prevent skewing of stop plate 205. 
 A detent bail 208 is pivoted on a stud 209 in wall 132 and is urged by a spring 210, see also Figure 9, to bring a notched arm into engagement with an ear on plate 206 to hold the plate 206 and stop plate 205 in either the reset position of Figure 9 or the arresting position as shown in Figure 10. 
 Plate 206 and stop plate 205 are normally in the reset position of Figure 9 and are shifted to the Figure 10 arresting position at the start of a machine cycle by a slide 212, slidable on a stud 213, Figure 7, in the bottom of frame 140. The front end of slide 212 is bent into an car which in the normal position of the pin carriage lies just to the left of the lower left end of plate 205 so that when the first column of pins 148 is indexed, the resulting step of the pin carriage will bring plate 206 behind the ear of slide 212. Slide 212 is actuated rearwardly at the start of an entry cycle by a lever 214 pivoted on a stud 216 in sidewall 46, see also Figure 40, and tensioned by a spring 217 to hold its upper arm to which slide 212 is connected, against the roller 53 on the left crank pin 51. Roller 53 Will actuate slide 212 to set 0 stop plate 205 into the arresting position at the start of a machine cycle and will release lever 214 and slide 212 for restoration by spring 217 prior to the time actuators 177 reach their 0 position. Plate 205 will thereupon arrest all actuators 177 for which no pin 148 has been set, at the 0 position and will then be restored to the reset position by the continued movement of drive levers 186, Figures 9 and 10, in the same manner as the 0 pins 148 are restored. 
Restoration of the pin carriage (Figs. 3, 5, and 7) After actuator drive carriage 181 has reached its upper position, all of the actuators 177 are differentially positioned and pins 148 and 0 stop plate 205 are reset as has been described. The pin carriage does not perform any function from this point on and may therefore be restored to its normal position during restoration of the drive carriage 181 and actuators 177. As shown in Figures 5 and 7, the pin carriage restoring mechanism is connected to the stud holding guide roller 146 on the front plate 136 of the pin carriage and includes a link 218 connected between the stud and a leg of a bell crank 220 pivoted on a stud 221 in the bottom keyboard plate 102. The other leg of bell crank 220 is connected to one end of a link 222 which has at its rear end a slotted bent up flange, see also Figure 3. A pin 224 fixed in the left auxiliary bracket 62 passes through the slot of link 222 to slidably support the rear end of the link. As pins 148 are indexed by keys 100, the pin carriage moves to the left in Figure 5 and through bell crank 220 moves link 222 forwardly step by step. 
 Pivoted on a stud 225, Figure 3, in auxiliary frame 62, is an arm 226 tensioned counterclockwise by a spring 228 to press a roller 229 on the arm 226 against the restoring cam 63. A cam 63 rotates clockwise in Figure 3 roller 229 of arm 226 rides on the concentric surface until about mid-cycle when the actuators 177 are all differentially positioned and all pins 148 have been reset. During the next quarter cycle, cam 63 rocks arm 226 clockwise to bring a roller 230 on the end of the arm 226 against the edge of the flange of link 222 and restore link 222 rearwardly and through bell crank 220, restore the pin carriage to its home position. Since there is no need to reset any pins 148 during this movement, the pin carriage is not given the usual excess movement beyond the home position but is stopped just as the escapement arm 153, Figure 7, which has ratcheted over the reset top pins snaps behind the last pin 148 to hold the carriage set in position. With this type of movement, it is not possible, as it is in conventional machines, to operate a digit key 100 during the time the pin carriage is moved past its home position and thus index an amount incorrectly by failure to index the first digit of the amount. During the last quarter cycle of cam 63, arm 226 is released fast enough to permit escapement of the pin carriage faster than any operator can index an amount so that there will be no interference with movement of the pin carriage. 
Digit key lock (Figs. 3 and 5) The digit keys 100 are prevented from operating during a machine cycle until the pin carriage is restored as described above and the actuators 177 are returned to about their position by a key lock plate 232, Figure 5, slidable under the bottom key plate 102 on studs 233. Look plate 232 is tensioned forwardly by a spring 234 between a pin 236 on the lock plate and the forward stud 233 to move under the lower end of all digit keys 100 and all of the function keys of the keyboard except the repeat key to prevent depression of any key and to hold down an operated key. Lock plate 232 is held from such locking movement by an arm 237 pivoted on the right stud 233 and having a slot about pin 236. The left end of arm 237 is connected by a link 238 to a lever 240 pivoted on a stud 241 in the left sidewall 46, see also Figure 3, to bear with its bent off ear against key lock cam 52 under the influence of spring 234. Immediately after a machine cycle is started, the sharp corner of cam 52 moves from the ear of lever 240 to permit spring 234 to move lock plate 232 forwardly to lock the keys against depression. It will be noted, Figure 3, that the bottom end of all keys is formed with a small rearwardly extending lug which engages the bottom of plate 102 to limit the upward movement of a key. When any function key except the repeat key is operated to initiate a machine cycle, lock plate 232 will engage over this lug on the key to hold the key down until the other keys are unlocked. If a digit key 100 happens to be held depressed during a machine cycle, this key 100 will also be retained depressed but this will not cause any damage as the key slide 108 is released from the pin setter 122 when the key 100 reaches its full depression and there will be no interference between the pins 148 during return of the pin carriage and the pin setters 122. 
 The key lock plate 232 will be retained in the locking position until approximately 270 of the machine cycle at which time the pin carriage is fully restored by restore cam 63 and the actuators 177 have their feet about at the level of the lowest row of pins 148. At this point, the rise of cam 52 will engage the ear of lever 240 to shift the lever 240, link 238, atm 237 and lock plate 232 back to the unlocking position of Figure whereupon the digit keys may again be operated to enable at least a partial indexing of a new amount prior to the end of the machine cycle. 
Item repeat mechanism (Figs. 5-7, 11, 26, and 39) An item repeat machine cycle is one in which the pins 148 are not reset to their initial positions during a machine cycle nor is the pin carriage returned to its home position so that the set up item may be retained indexed to control actuators 177 during a subsequent machine cycle. Such an item repeat cycle is initiated by de pression of a repeat key 242, Figures 2, 26, and 39, slidable in keyboard top and bottom plates 101 and 102 and urged upwardly by a spring 244, Figure 39. Pivoted on a stud 245 in the right keyboard side wall 104 is a bell crank 246 urged clockwise by a spring 248 to retain a belt off ear on the forward arm of the bell crank 246 under a shoulder of key 242. The bent off ear of bell crank 246 is, in the normal position of key 242, engaged by a shoulder of a slide 249 movable rearwardly on studs 250 in sidewall 104 under the pull of a spring 252, Figure 4. The forward end of slide 249 is formed with an arm extending upwardly in front of a pin 253 on arm 78 previously described. When key 242 is depressed, it rocks bell crank 246 counterclockwise to move the ear of bell crank 246 below the shoulder of slide 249 whereupon the slide 249 is moved rearwardly by spring 252 to rock bell crank 246 further by the cam surface on slide 249 immediately in front of the shoulder. A pin 254 on key 242, Figure 39, engages the bottom keyboard plate 102 to limit depression of key 242. The forward arm of slide 249 rocks arm 78 as the slide 249 moves rearwardly to release the clutch dog 83, Figure 27, of the machine clutch to initiate a cycle of the main shaft as described under the heading Machine Cycling Mechanism. 
 When bell crank 246 is rocked by key 242 and slide 249, its lower arm, which extends through the lower keyboard plate 102 and is slotted, pushes rearwardly a a wire 256 having a bent portion engaged in the slotted part of the bell crank 246. Wire 256 is connected at its rear end to the right arm of a lever 257, see also Figure 5, pivoted on a stud 258 in an arm of a bell crank 260 and urged clockwise by a spring 261. The rearward motion of wire 256 rocks lever 257 counterclockwise to position the left arm of lever 257 in alignment with a stud 262 fixed to the lower surface of frame as shown in Figure 6. 
 Shortly after the start of a machine cycle and before the actuators 177 are raised above their lowest position, the repeat cam 47, Figure 39, rocks a lever 264 rotatable on the right end of shaft 241, counterclockwise against the tension of spring 265 to move rearwardly a link 266 connected between the lower end of lever 264 and bell crank 260. Bell crank 260 is thereby rocked clockwise about its pivot pin 268 in the right auxiliary frame 54 to move lever 257 leftward against stud 262 on frame 140 and carry the frame 140 to the left into the Figure 6 position where the set stops 148 are in the path of movement of the feet of actuators 177 and hence are still effective to arrest the actuators but are out of the path of the resetting cam surfaces on the drive levers 186 so that pins 148 will not be reset during a repeat cycle. In addition to this, the leftward movement of frame 140 is effective to disable the pin carriage restoring mechanism. Referring to Figure 5, a stud 269 near the left end of the bottom of frame 140 is engaged in a slotted forward end of a lever 270 pivoted on a stud 272 in the left auxiliary frame 62. A pin 27.3 in the rear end of lever 270 projects downwardly into a slot in restore link 222, a part of the pin carriage restoring devices described under the heading Restoration of the Pin Carriage. When frame 140 is moved to the left it rocks lever 270 to pivot link 222 about its connection with bell crank 220 and move the flanged rear end of link 222 out of the path of movement of roller 230 to prevent the pin carriage from being restored to its home position during a repeat cycle. After the actuators 177 have been fully restored to their normal position, lever 264, Figure 39, is released by cam 47 to enable spring 265 and spring 145, Figure 5, for the frame 140 to restore the frame 140 and bell crank 260 to their normal positions. 
, During continuous machine cycling by the repeat key 242 for repeated entries of an item, the pin carriage due to its spring connection in frame 140 may vibrate or rebound which could cause an occasional error in an item entered. Such vibration is now eliminated by a wire 274, Figures 3, 7 and 7B, loosely held at its front end on a stud 276 in the left arm 82 of cycle trip shaft 79 and passing rearwardly through a hole in a bracket 277, Figures 7 and 7B on the pivot of back space lever 164 into alignment with the back space rack 169. When shaft 79 is rocked to initiate a machine cycle, wire 274 is moved rearwardly into the teeth of back space rack 169 to hold the pin carriage securely on frame 140. Wire 274 is removed from back space rack 169 when shaft 79 is restored to the cycle arresting position, which as will be pointed out, is very shortly before the pin carriage restoring mechanism can start the pin carriage moving toward its home position. 
 When the repeat key 242 is held down for a multiple entry of an amount, the machine will cycle at a higher rate if the cycle trip shaft 79, Figure 26, is held in the cycling position rather than being restored in every cycle by cycle restore cam 57 as has been described. To permit shaft 79 to be held in the actuated position by the repeat slide 249, Figure 39, so long as key 242 is held down, the cycle restore arm 93, Figure 26, is formed with a slot in which is engaged a stud 278 on key 242 so that arm 93 will be swung counterclockwise as key 242 is depressed. With arm 93 in this lower position, pin 94 will be in the horizontal part of the slot in arm 93 so that the reciprocation of arm 93 by the cycle restore cam 57 will not affect arm 78 or shaft 79. Slide 249 will not be reset to its forward position and the item repeat mechanism will remain in an active position to shift frame 140 leftward in each cycle as above described. 
 It will be seen from Figure that the key lock plate 232 is cut away so that it does not latch key 242 down at any time and the key 242 will be raised to its upper position by its spring 244 and spring 95 on arm 93 without reference to the position of key lock 232. Referring again to Figure 26, after a machine cycle is initiated by repeat key 242, arms 93 and 87 will be in a rearward position with roller 86 following the surface of cam 57. If repeat key 242 is now released, pin 94 is in line with the vertical part of the slot in arm 93 and key 242 and arm 93 will be immediately lifted to the normal upper positions. During the third quarter of that machine cycle cam 57 will drive link 87 and arm 93 forwardly to shift arm 78, shaft 79 and repeat slide 249 back to their normal positions where they will be latched by bell crank 246 and will retain them there until just before the end of the cycle. Wire 256, and lever 257, Figure 39, will not follow bell crank 246 in its return to latching position, and will, as permitted by the slot through which wire 256 passes, be frictionally held in their active positions by the engagement of lever 257 with stud 262 on frame 146. When lever 264 is released by repeat cam 47 to shift lever 257 to the right near the end of a machine cycle, wire 256 and lever 257 are free to be moved back to their normal positions by spring 261. 
 If release of key 242 is delayed until after the midcycle point, cam 57, Figure 26, will have moved arm 93 forward and pin 94 will be in the horizontal part of the slot of arm 93. This pin 94 will then prevent arm 93 and key 242 from return to normal position until cam 57 releases roller 86 and arm 93 at the end of that machine cycle at which time spring shifts arm 93 rearwardly bringing the vertical part of the slot into line with pin 94 whereupon arms 93 and key 242 will restore to their upper positions. As arm 78 and slide 249 remain in their set positions, the machine continues for another cycle during which arm 93 will again be shifted by cycle restore cam 57 to then reset arm 78 and slide 249 to the restored positions. Thus, a momentary depression of key 242 will initiate a single machine cycle during which the pins 148 and the pin carriage will be retained in their indexed postion but a retention of key 242 in the depressed position until after the mid-cycle time will cause a second repeat cycle to follow. Broadly, release of key 242 before the mid point of a cycle will arrest the machine at the end of that cycle but release of the key 242 after that time will not cause arrest of the machine until the end of the succeeding cycle. 
Printing mechanism (Figs. 1, 3 and 4) A printing mechanism to make a permanent record of the items indexed into the pin carriage and controlling the movement of the actuators 177 is mounted between the sidewalls 45 and 46 above the actuators 177. Referring to Figure 1, a type bar 280 carrying a block of type 281 is pivotally mounted on a stud 28-2 in each actuator 177 and is urged counterclockwise in Figure 1 by a spring 284 between it and its actuator 177. The upper end of each type bar 288 is guided in slots cut in a comb plate 285 secured to the upper ends of a pair of plates 286, one fixed to the inner side of each sidewall 45 and 46 and spaced a short distance therefrom. The type bars 280 are movable in the slots of comb 285 and about their pivot 282 to bring the type blocks 281 against a rotatable platen 288 between the sidewalls 45 and 46. Platen 288 may be any of the types of platen generally used and serves to support a paper tape, not shown, between it and type blocks 281 to receive imprints thereon. Platen 288 may be equipped with the usual feed rolls, paper table, line space detent, tear off plate, etc., which devices form no part of the present invention and are, therefore, not particularly detailed in this specification. 
 After the actuators 177 have been differentially positioned under control of the set pins 148 to bring the type blocks 281 into position to print the indexed amount at the printing line on the paper tape about platen 288, the type bars 280 are driven against platen 288 in a printing movement by hammers 289 each individual to a type bar 280. The hammers are free to rotate on a shaft 290 between plates 286 and are individually urged clockwise by springs 292 connected between the hammers 289 and an anchor bar 293 in plates 286. Comb 285 is also slotted to receive projections on the upper ends of hammers 289 to guide the hammers 289 which hammers are normally retained in their Figure 1 position by a rod 294 passing to the rear of the hammers 289 and fixed in two levers 296 pivoted one on the outside of each sidewall 45 and 46. A spring 297 secured to each lever 296, see also Figures 3 and 4, tensions the top arm of lever 296 to the machine rear to hold a bent lower arm of each lever against the guide rollers 182 of actuator drive carriage 181 which in its lower position holds levers 296 and restoring bar 294 in the hammer restoring position of Figure 1. As carriage 181 moves upwardly during a machine cycle, rollers 182 are moved along the lower arms of levers 296 to free the levers to the action of their springs 297 and permit the restoring bar 294 to move rearwardly and free hammers 289. 
 Hammers 289 are not, however, free to follow rod 294 at this time for they are held by the engagement of a lower tail of each hammer 289 with a tooth of a hammer release bell crank 298, all of which bell cranks are pivoted on a rod 300 between the plates 286 and each of which has an ear bent off of a lower arm to overlap the lower arm of the bell crank 298 to the right so that when any bell crank 298 is rocked counterclockwise it will carry with it all bell cranks 298 to its right. A pair of levers 301 are pivoted one on the inside of each of the sidewalls 45 and 46 and are joined together by a rod 302 on which are mounted levers 304, one for each bell crank 298 and each having a rear arm passing through a guide comb 305 to underlie a pin 306 in the top of each actuator 177. A spring 308 between the forward arm of each lever 304 and the forward arm of its bell crank 298 acts to hold the forward arm of each bell crank 298 against a flexible pad 309 of a bar 310 joining the plates 286, to urge levers 304 counterclockwise and hold the rear arm of each lever 304 against its pin 306 and the springs as a group hold levers 301 clockwise against a stop 312 in the adjacent sidewall 45 or 46. 
 As the actuator bars 177 rise during a machine cycle, the pin 306 on each bar 177 frees its lever 304 to rotate counterclockwise under the action of its spring 308 and, when the foot of any actuator bar rises to the level of the second row of pins 148, representing a l printing position, pin 306 has released its lever 304 enough to bring a shoulder on lever 304 behind an ear bent 01f of each hammer release bell crank 298 which car arrests further rotation of the lever 304. When actuator drive carriage 181 reaches its highest position at about midcycle, the tops of the carriage ends strike the rear arms of levers 301 to rock the levers counterclockwise and move all of the levers 304 to the front of the machine. For any actuator 177 which has risen to at least the 1 position, lever 304 has its shoulder behind the ear of its bell crank 298 and during such forward movement of lever 304, the bell crank 298 will be rocked to release its tooth from the hammer 289, freeing the hammer to the action of its spring 292 and driving type bar 281 against platen 288. Due to the overlapping ears on the bell cranks 298, each bell crank 298 when rocked as above to release its hammer 289 will rock all other bell cranks 298 to the right releasing all hammers to its right to cause printing from the rightward type bars 281 which have been arrested at the position. Conversely the type bars 281 to the left of the leftmost actuator 177 which has risen above 0, will not have their hammers released when levers 301 are actuated and printing of the nonsignificant Os from such type bars 281 will be suppressed. 
 The movement of the levers 296 and bar 294 will be reversed during the return of actuator carriage 181 to its normal position. Such reversed movement of levers 296 will bring the bar 294 back to its position of Figure 1 carrying with it the hammers 289 which have been released to cause printing from the type bars 281. Since the levers 301 are released by the initial downward movement of carriage 181, the bell cranks 298 are free to again latch over the tails of the hammers 289 and retain them in their cocked positions during a succeeding cycle until levers 301 are again rocked by carriage 181. 
 The hammer restoring movement of the left lever 296, Figure 3, is also used to rotate platen 288 one step counterclockwise to present a new portion of the paper thereabout for the next printing impression. A slide 313 has a slot near its rear end embracing a fixed pin 314 and in its forward end has a slot through which is passed the hammer restoring bar 294. In the rest position of the machine, the restoring bar 294 is at the forward end of its slot in slide 313 to hold the slide at its forward limit of travel. A projecting lug 316 at the rear of slide 313 engages a stud 317 on an arm 318 pivoted on the shaft 320 of platen 288 and urged clockwise by a spring 321. A pawl 322 is pivoted on arm 328 and is tensioned counterclockwise by a spring 324 connected between its rear arm and slide 313 to urge its forward pawl end into engagement with a ratchet wheel 325 secured to platen shaft 320. In the normal position of arm 318, a downwardly extending lug of pawl lever 322 contacts a fixed pin 326 to hold pawl lever 322 slightly clockwise and away from ratchet wheel 325. When hammer restoring lever 296 rocks the restoring bar 294 rearwardly during a machine cycle, slide 313 and arm 318 are freed to move under the drive of spring 321 and the initial movement of arm 318 moves pawl lever 322 from its engagement with pin 326 so that the pawl 322 may engage with and ratchet over the teeth of ratchet 325 during the clockwise movement of arm 318. On the restoration of slide 313 by bar 294 near the end of the machine cycle, lug 316 rocks arm 318 counterclockwise and pawl 322, then engaged in the teeth of ratchet wheel 325, will turn wheel 325 and platen 288 to advance the paper. The final movement of arm 318 will engage pawl 322 with pin 326 to free the pawl from ratchet wheel 325. It will be understood that conventional detenting devices and variable line spacing devices may be used in conjunction with this platen spacing mechanism to detent the platen against reverse rotation by pawl 322 and to control the engagement of pawl 322 with ratchet 325 to provide a more commercially acceptable machine. 
Printing ribbon mechanism (Figs. 3, 4 and 38) An inked ribbon 328 is passed across the front of platen 288 between the type blocks 281 and the printing line on the record paper. The ribbon 328 will be wound from a spool 329 on a stud in ribbon lift arm 202, Figure 4, forward around a pin 330 in the end of arm 202, up and around an angled guide 332 and leftward across the front of platen 288. On the left side of the machine the ribbon 328 passes from the angled guide 332 down to pin 330 and back to be wound up on left spool 329. It will be remembered that ribbon lift arms 202 are connected by links 201 to the cam arms 197 and will be released to the action of their springs 204, Figures 3A and 4, as the arms 197 are driven. Each angled guide 332 is part of a link 333 connected to lift arm 202 by pin 330 and carrying a stud 33'4 movable in a slot in the adjacent sidewall 45 or 46 to guide the link 333. During upward movement of lift arms 202, the links 333 elevate ribbon 328 into the printing position between platen 288 and type blocks 281 and restore with the arms 202 to lower the ribbon for better visibility of the printed item. 
 Each ribbon spool 329 is freely rotatable on a pivot pin 336 secured in an arm 202 and engages with a ratchet wheel 337 also rotatable on pivot pin 336. A bell crank 338, see also Figure 38, is pivoted on a stud 340 in each sidewall 45 and 46 at a point slightly below and forward from each spool 329 and the two bell cranks 338 are connected together for opposite movement by a lever 341 having an arm engaging in a notch in the end of the upper arm of each bell crank 338. Lever 341 is pivoted at its center on a stud 3'42 midway between the sidewalls 45 and 46, in a bracket 344 fixed to sidewall 45 and connects the bell cranks 338 so that only one bell crank can have its upper arm in an active rearward position at any time. Pivoted on a screw 345 in the upper arm of each bell crank 338, is a ratchet pawl 346 urged by a spring 348 into engagement with a stud 349 in the bell crank 338. On the bell crank which is in its active position, ratchet pawl 346 will be engaged with the ratchet 337 as in Figure 3 and as the ribbon lift arm 202 raises ratchet 337 during a machine cycle, pawl 346 will force the ratchet 337 to rotate and turn spool 329 to wind up a section of ribbon 328. The other spool 329 will be free to rotate at this time and will have a section of ribbon 328 withdrawn from it. 
 Pivoted on a screw 350 in each lift arm 202 is a detent pawl 352, Figures 3 and 4, tensioned by a spring 353 to bring a bent off ear at its rear end into the teeth of its ratchet wheel 337 to prevent backward rotation of 17 ratchet 337. A pin 354 in each bell crank 338 engages a tail projecting from detent 352 when the bell crank is in an inactive position, to rock the detent 352 slightly to the Figure 4 position and move the bent off ear of detent 352 from its ratchet Wheel 337 so that ribbon 328 can be unwound from that spool 329. 
 When the ribbon 328 is substantially all unwound from one spool 329, it is necessary to switch the positions of the two bell cranks 338 so that the exhausted spool 329 will then be driven to wind up the ribbon again. This reversal of bell cranks 338 is controlled by a pair of ribbon sensing arms 356 each pivoted on a screw 357 on one of the lift arms 202 and tensioned by a spring 358 to bear against the ribbon 328 on the adjacent spool 329. When there is very little ribbon left on a spool 329, the lower end of the arm 356 sensing that spool moves against a bent off ear 360 of bell crank 338. During the next machine cycle, arm 202 is lifted to bring the lower end of sensing arm 356 over ear 360 so that when arm 202 is restored by cam arm 197, arm 356 will bear down on ear 360 to reverse the positions of the bell cranks 338 and enable motion of arms 202 to thereafter wind ribbon back on to the exhausted spool 329. 
Correction key mechanism (Figs. 3 and 40) When an item is erroneously indexed in pins 148 and it is desired to completely remove this item from the machine, a correction key 361, see also Figure 2, is operated. This key 361 is, as shown in Figure 3, slidably mounted in upper and lower keyboard plates 101 and 102 and is held in an upper position by a spring 362. Key 361 has two spaced ears near its lower end between which is held a bent off ear of a bell crank 364 pivoted on a screw 365 in left wall 105 of the keyboard. The ear of bell crank 364 is engaged behind a shoulder of a slide 366 urged rearwardly by a spring 368 but normally held in a forward position on guide screws 369 by the engagement of the ear of bell crank 364 with the shoulder. The forward end of slide 366 has an ear extending upwardly in front of pin 276 on cycle trip arm 82 so that when key 361 is depressed to rock bell crank 364, slide 366 is released to rock cycle trip shaft 79 and initiate a machine cycle as has been set out. During such a machine cycle, the actuator drive levers 186, Figure 1, reset any set pins 148 to their unset positions and restore cam 63, Figures 5 and 5A, restores the pin carriage to its home position thereby removing the erroneous item from the indexing mechanism. 
 As the item is, in this instance, an erroneous one, it should not be printed on the record tape. Since at least one actuator 177 must move about its 0 position before any printing hammers will be released, an item will not be printed if all actuators 177 are arrested at their 0 position. The actuators 177 may be stopped at 0 by a 0 stop bail 370 having two arms secured to shaft 241, see also Figures 1 and 40, and a stop blade between the arms and passing just to the rear of actuators 177. A pin 372 on the left arm of bail 370 passes through the left sidewall 46 into a slot in the rear end of a link 373, Figure 3, and is connected by a spring 374 to an ear of link 373 to hold pin 372 in the forward part of the slot. Link 373 is supported at its forward end by a pin 376, Figure 3, which passes through a slot in a lower arm of bell crank 364 for the correction key 361. Link 373 is tensioned rearwardly by a spring 377, see also Figure 40, at its rear end to hold pin 376 near the rear end of the slot of bell crank 364 and to hold the rear of the link 373 against a pin 378 in the bottom of lever 214 previously described under the heading Non- Indexed 0 Stop. When key 361 is depressed the rocking of bell crank 364 will, after a short idle movement, move link 373 forwardly to tension the 0 stop bail 370 counterclockwise against actuators 177. When the actuators 177 rise during the ensuing machine cycle, bail 37 0 will move into a notch in the actuators to arrest them at their 0 position. The set pins 148 and the pin carriage will be restored in the normal manner and actuators 177 will be returned to their rest position at about the three-quarter point of the machine cycle. Key 361 has a lug formed on the bottom end which lug will be engaged by the key lock slide 232, Figure 5, to lock key 361 in its depressed position until the actuators have been fully restored as has been set out. 
 As no actuators 177 have risen above the 0 position in the correction cycle, no printing hammers 289 are released for printing on the record tape and to avoid a blank space on the tape, the platen line spacing mechanism is disabled by the correction key 361. As has been set out, the platen 288 is line spaced by movement of a slide 313, Figure 3, and this slide 313 will be blocked when key 361 is depressed. A lever 380 pivoted on a screw 381 in the left side plate 46 has a forward slotted arm engaging a stud 382 on key 361 and has a bent off ear on its rear arm engageable behind a lug 384 of slide 313. When key 361 is depressed, lever 380 is rocked to place its ear behind lug 384 to prevent movement of slide 313 during the machine cycle and thus prevent line spacing of platen 288 by slide 313. 
Registering mechanism (Figs. 1,13, 25, 36 and 37) Referring to Figure 1, each of a plurality of pairs of rack bars 385 is slidably held on one of a pair of spaced studs 386 fixed in the rear extension of each actuator bar 177. Each rack passes through a cut in one of two bars 388 fixed between the sidewalls 45 and 46 and the two racks of a pair are separated at their lower ends by a fixed spacer plate 389 also between the sidewalls 45 and 46. Each rack bar 385 carries a stop arm 390 pivoted on a rack bar stud 392 and provided with a pin 393 passing through a slot in the rack bar. A spring 394 connected between an inner arm of each stop arm 390 and a central projection of the arm of the actuator 177 to which the arm 390 is connected urges the inner arms of the arms 390 downwardly to hold pin 393 in the outer end of the slot in its rack bar 385 with a tail of the stop arm 390 projecting to the outside of the rack bars 385. 
 A shaft 396 carries a plurality of toothed register wheels 397, one for each actuator 177 and pair of rack bars 385, between the racks 385 and is horizontally slidable in slots in the sidewalls 45 and 46 to engage the register wheels 397 with either the front group or the rear group of rack bars 385. Each register wheel 397 has, in this case, twenty teeth with two diametrically opposed tens transfer teeth inset to the left of two of the teeth. Freely rotatable on rods 398 are a plurality of tens transfer arms 400 one for each rack 385. Each transfer arm 400 is guided in a fixed comb plate 401 to hold a projection of the transfer arm under the lower end of the stop arm 390 of the adjacent rack bar 385 and at its lower end has a transfer pawl 402 pivotally connected thereto. Each transfer pawl 402 has a lower arm projecting toward the register wheels 397 and an upper arm connected by a spring 404 to comb plate 401, the spring acting both to urge the lower arm of the pawl 402 upwardly to engage a shoulder on the pawl with the inner edge of the bar 388 and to rotate the transfer arm to remove its lug from under the stop arm 390. In the normal position the engagement of the shoulder on transfer pawl 402 with bar 388 holds the pawl and transfer arm 400 in the Figure 1 position with the end of the lower arm of pawl 402 to the left of the adjacent rack to the right and in alignment with the transfer teeth of the register wheel 397 to the right. As any register wheel 397 passes from the 9 to the 0 position or from
