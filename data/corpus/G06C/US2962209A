 The machine chosen to illustrate the present invention has many basic principles and features which are similar in many respects to those of a well-known type of cash register, which is fully disclosed in the following United States patents: No. 1,816,263, issued July 28, 1931; No. 1,929,652, issued October 10, 1933; No. 2,048,200, issued Iuly 21, 1936; and No. 2,056,485, issued October 6, 1936, all to William H. Robertson. 
 Reference may be had to the above-listed patents for a history of the development of the pioneer machines of this type and for a complete disclosure of mechanism used in the present machine, which is similar to the corresponding mechanism of the pioneer or basic machines, and which for that reason will be described only in general terms in the present application. 
 Likewise, the machine embodying the present invention is identical in its appearance and in many of its structural details to the machine disclosed in co-pending application for Letters Patent of the United States, Serial No. 341,633, filed March 11, 1953, by Frank R. Werner et al., inventors, now Patent No. 2,880,930, to which reference may be had for a full disclosure of similar mechanism illustrated in the present application, and which will be described only in general terms, unless it is pertinent to the present invention. 
 Mechanism pertinent to the present invention will be fully described in the ensuing pages. 
MACHINE IN GENERAL AND ITS SUPPORTING FRAMEWORK The mechanism of the machine is supported by right and left side frames and 101 (Fig. 3) and by corresponding auxiliary frames, not shown, secured to the upper ends of said right and left frames, which latter are in turn secured at their lower ends to a machine base plate 102. The base plate 102 rests in and is secured to a shallow pan, not shown, in turn secured to the top surface of a drawer cabinet 103 (Fig. 1), which has mounted therein a cash drawer 104, which opens automatically at the end of machine operations, as will be explained later, and which may be opened manually by authorized persons, having a key to the right-hand closure of a machine case or cabinet 105 (Fig. 1). The cabinet 105 encloses the mechanism of the machine and is constructed of suitable material, such as sheet metal, and is secured to the machine base plate 102 near its perimeter by suitable screws, which engage threaded holes in said machine base plate 102. The side frames 100 and 101 (Fig. 3) are maintained in proper side-spaced relationship to each other by the base plate 102, by a back plate 107 secured between said side frames, and by various cross bars, plates, rods and shafts, which will be explained in their proper order as the description progresses. 
 The cabinet 105 (Figs. 1 and 2) has a large opening 108 in the front thereof, to provide proper clearance for the keyboard and special counter mechanisms. The keyboard of the present machine comprises four rows or denominational orders of amount keys 109, a row of #1 selecting or control keys 110 to 114 inclusive, a row of #2 selecting or control keys 115 to 119 inclusive, four Clerks keys 120, and a release key 121, for releasing any depressed key prior to operation of the machine. The keyboard of the machine also includes a total control lever 122 often referred to as a Unit Lock Lever, which is movable to various positions to control the various functions of the machine, said positions including Adding or Register position, Locked-Register position, and #1 and #2 Reading and Resetting positions. The total control lever 122 (Figs. 1 and 2) has incorporated therein a lock 123, which is provided with two keys, one of which permits said lever to be locked in either Register or Locked-Register position so that said lever may not be moved out of there positions by unauthorized persons not in possession of said key. The total control lever 122 is normally locked against movement into either #1 or#2 Reset position, and a special reset key is provided for the lock 123, for unlocking the lever so that it may be moved to either of these reset positions. It is, therefore, impossible for persons not in possession of a reset key to move the total control lever to either of its reset positions to clear the amount from any of the totalizers which are controlled by said lever 122. 
 The keyboard of the machine likewise includes a plurality of special counters 125 to 133 inclusive (Figs. 1 and 3), the wheels of which are visible through corresponding openings in a special counter cover plate 124, which is secured to the machine framework, and is readily removable, when the machine cabinet 105 is removed, to provide access to the special counter mechanism. 
 The special counters include a Reset counter 125, which counts 1 each time the total control lever 122 is moved either to #1 or #2 Reset position (see also Fig. 3), five #2 transaction counters 126 to 130 inclusive, which correspond to the transaction control keys 115 to 119, and are selected for actuation by said control keys through their differential mechanism, as will be explained later. Use of one of the control keys 115 to 119 to select the corresponding totalizer on the #2 line for actuation in either adding, reading or resetting operations, causes the corresponding special counter 126 to 130 to be selected for actuation and during machine operation 1 is added in said corresponding counter. 
 There are three special counters131, 132 and 133, for the first row of transaction keys. Like the #2 transaction keys, the #1 transaction or control keys are provided with a difiierential mechanism which is positioned by said escapee keys, said differential mechanism, in turn, controlling the selection of the corresponding special counters 131, 132 and 133, to keep an accurate count of the number of times these keys are used in certain transactions, as will be explained later. The special counter 132 (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) is a Paid-Out counter and is controlled by the Paid-Out key 110 to accumulate 1 each time saidkey is used to initiate machine operation. The special counter 133 is a Customer counter and is controlled by the single One Item key 113 and by the Cash Total key 1 14, to keep an accurate count of the customers in both single-item and multiple-item transactions. 
 As explained previously, the #1 control key 114has two functions, Cash Total and No-Sale, and when said control key is used in a No-Sale transaction, it causes 1 to be entered in the No-Sale special counter 131 to keep an accurate counter of the number of No-Sale transactions. All of the special counters 126 to'133 inclusive, may be reset to zero at the same time by a knob, not shown, which is accessible through a closure 134 on the righthand side of the cabinet 105. The closure 134 is provided with a lock, so that only authorized persons in possession of the key to said lock may have access to the reset knob for resetting the special counters. 
 In addition to selecting the corresponding special counters, the differential mechanisms for the control keys likewise control the positioning of corresponding front and back indicators 136 (Fig. 1) only the front indicators being shown herein, for indicating the type of operation being performed. Likewise the control differential mechanisms are connected to and position corresponding type wheels for printing data corresponding thereto upon issuing receipts 139 (Figs. 17 and 18), which are fed out an opening 138 provided therefor near the upper righthand portion'of the cabinet 105, and for printing similar information upon a detail strip 140, a portion of which is visible through an opening in the righthand side of the cabinet adjacent the control keys. The front indicators 136 are visible through an opening 143 in the cabinet 105, and the rear indicators are visible through a similar opening in the back of the cabinet. 
 Like the control keys, each row of amount keys 109 (Figs. 1 and 2) is provided with a differential mechanism for positioning corresponding amount type wheels for printing amounts on the receipts 139 and the detail strip 140, and for positioning corresponding front and back indicators 137, only the front indicators shown here, said front indicators being visible through the opening 143. The Clerks keys 120 are also provided with a differential mechanism for positioning corresponding type wheels for printing identifying letters on the receipts and the detail strip. 
 Inasmuch as the last several items printed on the detail strip 140 are not visible through the opening in the cabinet 105, mechanism is provided for temporarily advancing the detail strip 140 so that said last few items will be visible. The mechanism for advancing the detail strip is operated by :a knob 141 mounted on the closure 134 and engageable with the advancing mechanism when said closure is in closed position, as shown in Fig. 1. Operation of the knob 141 in one direction advances the detail strip 140 against spring tension so that the last few entries thereon are visible through the opening in the cabinet. Releasing the knob 141 permits the detail strip 140 to be spring-returned to its original printing position. Means is also provided for manually advancing the web of the detail strip 140 when necessary or desirable, and this mechanism is operated by a knob 142, which extends through an opening in the closure 134. 
 The machine is normally operated by the usual type of electric motor, not shown but fully disclosed in the application, Serial No. 341,633, referred to'before. However, in emergencies, the machine may be operated manually by means of a hand crank, not shown, which is inserted through an opening 156 provided therefor in the closure 134 (Fig. l). A rockable shutter normally closes the opening 156. 
 The present machine is provided with two lines of interspersed totalizers, and in the present adaptation the #1 line, which is controlled by the keys to 114 inclusive (Figs. 1 and 2), has three sets of interspersed totalizers thereon, and the #2 totalizer line, which is controlled by the keys 1-15 to .119 inclusive, has five sets of interspersed totalizers thereon, said totalizer lines being shiftable laterally under control of their corresponding control keys to aline the selected totalizer thereon with the amount difierential mechanism for actuation thereby. Likewise, the control keys, in conjunction with the total control lever 122 control the engaging and disengaging movement of the selected totalizer and the difierential mechanism for entering amountsin said selected totalizers and for the taking of totals therefrom. Each totalizer line is provided with a tens transfer mechanism for transferring tens digits from lowerto higher denominations. 
 In addition to their other functions, the #1 control keys 110 to 114 are what are termed in this art as motorized keys in that any one of these keys, when depressed, initiate operation of the machine. Likewise the #2 control keys 115 to 119 inclusive, may also be motorized keys, if desired, depending upon the requirements of the business system to which the machine is being applied, however, in the present adaptation said #2 control keys are not motorized, but are used in conjunction with the #1 control keys. 
 in the ensuing pages, mechanism pertinent to the present invention will be described in detail. For a full disclosure of other mechanism of the machine, reference may be had to the patents and to the application listed at the beginning of this specification. 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION Amount keys and differential mechanisms therefor As explained previously in connection with Figs. 1 and 2, the present machine is provided with four rows of amount keys 1119, and each row of amount keys is provided with a corresponding differential mechanism comprising primary and secondary difierential members for transmitting the value of the depressed key to the indicating and printing mechanisms and for setting the wheels of the selected totalizer according to the value of said depressed amount key. Inasmuch as the several amount banks are similar in construction, and are fully disclosed in the application, Serial No. 341,633, now Patent No. 2,880,930, it is believed that a general description of the amount bank, illustrated in Fig. 4, will adequately serve the present purpose. 
 The amount keys 109, for the denominational order disclosed in Fig. 4, are slidably mounted in a key frame, not shown, in turn supported by rods (not shown) extending between the main frames 100 and 101. Depressing one of the amount keys 1119 moves the lower end of the stem thereof into the path of a projection 144 on a primary differential member 145, which together with a companion secondary differential member 146 is freely supported on a shaft 147 journaled in the main frames of the machine. The primary and secondary diiferential members 145 and 146 are coupled together for concert movement, at proper times, by a coupling pinion 148. 
 The primary and secondary differential members 145 and 146 are actuated by means of a universal rod 149, which extends through openings in said difierential members and which oscillates first clockwise and back to normal position (Fig. 4), to actuate the differential mechanism. Teeth in the upper edge of the secondary differential member 146 engage corresponding teeth in an idler gear 150, which meshes with the external teeth of an external-internal transmission gear (not shown), which transmits the positioning of the secondary differential member 146 to the corresponding type wheels and indicators, in the usual and well-known manner, as fully disclosed in the application, Serial No. 341,633, now Patent No. 2,880,930. 
 Initial movement clockwise of the universal rod 149 permits the primary member 145, under influence of a spring 151, to follow in unison therewith until the projection 144 strikes the lower end of the stem of the depressed amount key 109 to position said primary differential member 145 according to the value of said depressed amount key. After the primary differential member 145 has been positioned, as explained above, the universal rod 149 continues its initial movement to restore the secondary differential member 146 and the mechanism connected thereto, including the corresponding type wheels and indicators, to zero position. Prior to initial movement of the primary and secondary differential members 145 and 146, the coupling pinion 148 is disengaged therefrom, so that said members are free to move independently of each other to be positioned and restored, as explained above. 
 After the primary differential member 145 has been positioned according to the depressed amount key 109 and the secondary differential member 146 has been restored to zero, the coupling pinion 148 is reengaged with said members to couple them together, whereupon counter-clockwise return movement of the universal rod 149 carries the primary differential member 145 from its set position to zero or home position, against the tension of the spring 151, and positions the secondary member 146 in accordance therewith. The secondary differential member 146 in turn positions the corresponding type wheels and indicators in accordance with the value of the depressed amount key 109. Teeth in the periphcry of the primary differential member 145 cooperate with similar teeth in the corresponding ones of three sets of totalizer Wheels 152, mounted on a #1 totalizer line 153, and with teeth in the corresponding ones of five sets of totalizer wheels 154, mounted on a #2 totalizer line 155. 
 In adding operations, after the primary diflierential member 145 has been positioned under influence of the depressed amount key 109, as explained above, the corresponding wheels 152 and 154 of the selected totalizers are engaged with said primary differential member 145, and return movement thereof rotates said selected wheels a distance in an additive direction corresponding to the value of the depressed amount key, to enter said value in said wheels. After the primary differential member 145 has arrived in home or Zero position, the selected totalizer wheels are disengaged therefrom. 
 When no amount key 109 is depressed in the denominational order shown in Fig. 4, and being described herein as representative of all the amount banks, a zero stop bar 157, slidably mounted in the key frame, is moved inwardly from normal ineffective position into the path of the projection 144 to obstruct movement of the primary differential member 145 away from home or zero position, said primary differential member, in turn, causing the corresponding secondary differential member 146 to be positioned in zero position to position the type wheels and indicators accordingly. 
 In sub-total and total-taking operations, often referred to hereinafter as read and reset operations, the wheels 152 or 154 of the selected totalizer are engaged with the primary differential member 145 prior to its initial movement, which movement reversely rotates said wheel to zero position to position said primary differential member 145 according to the value on said wheel. Prior to positioning of the primary differential member 145 by the selected totalizer wheel, the coupling pinion 148 is disengaged, as explained above, to permit independent movement of said primary differential member 145 and the secondary differential member 146, said latter member being restored to zero position by the universal rod ,149, as explained in connection with adding operations. 
 After the primary differential member 145 has been positioned by the selected totalizer wheel and the secondary differential member 146 is restored to zero position, the coupling pinion 148 is engaged to couple said differential members for concert movement, whereupon counter-clockwise return movement of the universal rod 149 returns the primary differential member 145 from set position to zero position and carries the secondary differential member 146 in unison therewith a like extent, to position the corresponding type wheels and indicators in accordance with the amount standing on the zeroized totalizer wheels. In reset operations, the wheel of the selected totalizer is disengaged from the primary differential member 145 prior to its counterclockwise return movement, and consequently said wheel remains in Zeroized condition. In reading operations, the wheel of the selected totalizer is reengaged with the primary differential member 145 prior to its return movement and is restored thereby to its original position to preserve the total for further computations. 
 The depressed amount keys 109 (Figs. 1 and 2) are automatically released near the end of adding operations and may be manually released by depression of the release key 121 in case it is desirable or necessary. The amount keys 109 are of flexible construction, in that depression of one amount key releases a previously-depressed amount key in the same row and retains the latter depressed key in depressed position. 
Selecting and control mechanism for N0. 1 totalizer line The first and second transaction or control banks (Figs. 1, 23 and 26) each has a differential mechanism, similar in many respects to the amount differential mechanism, explained above, said differential mechanisms comprising primary differential members (not shown) and corresponding secondary differential members 158 and 159, respectively, free on the shaft 147 and positioned in exactly the same manner as explained for the amount differentials under influence of their corresponding #1 transaction keys 110 to 114- inclusive, (Fig. l) and #2 transaction keys 115 to 119 inclusive. The secondary differential members for the transaction banks control corresponding type wheels for printing identifying data on the detail strip and on the issuing receipts 139 (Figs. 16, 17 and 18) and also control the positioning of the indicator 136 (Fig. 1), to visually indicate the data represented thereby. 
 As previously explained, the totalizer wheels 152 (Fig. 4) of the #1 totalizer line are rotatably supported on a sleeve 161, in turn shiftably mounted on a shift 153, supported in a framework 160, which is shiftably mounted between totalizer end plates 162, only the lefthand plate being shown here, which are in turn secured to the corresponding main frames 100 and 101. 
 The #1 transaction or control keys 110 to 114 inclusive, each carries a stud 163 which cooperates with corresponding camming surface formed in corresponding indentations or notches in the periphery of a shifting segment 164 (Fig. 12) free on the shaft 147, and urged counter-clockwise by a spring 171 to normally maintain a finger 172 adjacent the camming surface for the Paid- Out key 110 in yielding contact with the stud 163 for said key 110. A rearward extension of the segment 164 has a notch which engages a stud 165 in an upward extension of an arm 166 free on a stationary stud 167. The arm 166 is flexibly connected to a companion gear sector 168 by a spring 174 tensioned between said arm and said sector, which spring normally maintains a shoulder on said arm in yielding contact with a stud 169 carried by said sector 168. The teeth of the sector 168 mesh with a gear 170 free on a stationary stud 175, and integral with a spiral grooved drum cam which coacts with a shifting yoke (not shown), to shift the sleeve 161 (Fig. 4) to segment clockwise, 
aline the .setof totalizer wheels 15.2 :011 the #1 line, :corresponding (to the depressed control key 110 {to 1 14 with the corresponding primary differential members 145 for actuation thereby. 
 As previouslyexplained, in multip e-i m IBI SQ 'FiQ JS the Cash Total key 114 {selects an item totalizer or itemizer on the #1 line, for clearing, and in additionactuates mechanism which automatically selects the group totalizer on the #1 line for actuation during the latter part of a Cash Total operation to cause the total amount of the multiple items cleared from "the multipleitem totalizer to be transferred additively into the wheels of the group totalizer. Depressing the Cash Total key 114 (Figs. 1, 2 and 12) to initiate an item total operation causes the stud 163 in said key, in cooperation with a corresponding camming surface on the segment 1641p aline the wheels of the item totalizer with the primary differential mem bers 145 so that initial movement of said members will zeroize said item totalizer wheels. Simultaneously the stud 163, in cooperation with a cumming surface on a segment 176 (Fig. 12) free on the shaft 147, and somewhat similar in outline to the segment 1 64 shifts said The segment 176 is pivotal ly con- .nectedby a link 177 to a totalizer shiftingarm 178 pivotally connected near its lower end to the sector 168. Clockwise movement of the segment 176 through the link 177 rocks the shifting arm 178 clockwise in -.unison therewith to move said arm from normal ineffective position, as shown in Fig. 12, to a position where a step formed in an opening in said arm, and corresponding to the #2 or group totalizer, is moved into coacting relationship with a stud 179 in a shifting segment 180. 
 After the item totalizer has been zeroiged to position the primary differential members 145 in accordance with the value thereon, the item totalizer is disengaged from said primary differential members 145 and the segment 180 functions to cause the stud 179, coacting with the step on the arm 178, to shift said arm and the sector 168 downwardly to cause said sector to aline the wheels of the group totalizer with the primary differentialmembers 145, after which said group totalizer wheels are engaged with said primary differential members 145-. Return movement of the primary differential members 145 from preset position to home position enters theamount cleared from the item totalizer in the group totalizer to preserve a group or grand total of all items. Thus, the transfer .of a total from one totalizer to another totalizer on the same line is eifected in a single machine cycle. 
Totalizer engaging and disengaging mechanism Mechanism operating under control of the #1 control keys 110 to 114 (Figs. 1 and 2) and under control of the total control lever 122,.is provided for controlling engaging movement of the shiftable framework 160 (Fig. 4) for the #1 totalizer line 153, to engage the selected set of totalizer wheels on said line with the primary differential members 145 in proper timing for the type of operation being performed. 
 Supported in the framework 160 (Figs. 4, 7 and 8') is a shaft 181, having rollers 182 on opposite ends thereof, engaged respectively by arms 183 and 184 secured on a shaft 185 journaled in the machine framework. The arm 184 has a cam slot 186 engaged by a roller 187 carried by an arm 188 free on a stud 189 extending between the right frame 100 and the right totalizer frame 162. A stud 190 supported by a downward extension of the arm 188 and a crank 191, secured to said arm, pivotally supports the rearward ends of an add engaging pitman 192 and a subtract engaging pitman 193, said pitmans being secured in properly spaced and fixed relationship to each other by a stud 194. The pitmans 192 and 193 have, respectively, enlarged forward ends with openings 195 and 196, forming totalizer engaging surfaces, which coact respectively with engaging studs 197 and 198 in similar cam levers 199' and 200 rotatably supported by a shaft 201 journaled in the machine frametioned in relation to the corresponding operating studs 197 and 198 through the medium of a link 211, which is pivotally connectedat its lower end to the pitmans 192 and 193 while the upper end of said link is slotted to receive astud 212 in a rearward extension of a .segment 213 free on a shaft 147. The segment 213 has carnrning lugs 214 and 215, which cooperate, respectively, with the studs 163 in the Sub-Total key 111 and the Cash Total key 114, (see also Figs. 1 and 2). A spring 216 urges the pitmans and the link 211 downwardly, and the segment 213 clockwise to normally maintain extending fingers of the camming lugs 214 and 215 in yielding contact with the corresponding studs 163. 
 The link 211 (Fig. 7) carries a stud 218 which engages the slot in the rearward end of a lever 219-free on a stud 220 fast in the right side frame. The forward end of the lever 219 carries a stud 221, which extends through a camming slot 222 in a segment 223 free on the shaft 147, and having an upward extension with a slot which engages a stud 224 in an arm 225 secured on a shaft 226 journaled in the machine framework. The shaft 226 is connected by mechanism, not shown, to the total control lever 122 (Figs. 1 and 2), so that operation of said total control lever will position the segment 223, thus causing the camming slot 222, in cooperation with the stud 221 to position the pitmans 192 and 193 in accordance with the position of said total control lever. 
 When the total control lever 122 is in normal or Register position, the segment 223 is positioned as shown in Fig. 7, which, in turn, locates the pitmans 192 and 193 in their lower-most position, as here shown. The positioning of the pitmans 192 and 193 in their lowermost position, under normal conditions, causes the selected set of Wheels on the #1 totalizer line 153 .to be engaged with the amount actuators in add timing. Moving the total control lever 122 to #1 Read position causes the segment 223 (Figs. 7 and 8) to position the pitmans 192 and 193 in their second position whereupon operation of the cams 206 and 207 causes the selected set of wheels on the #1 totalizer line to be engaged with the primary differential members in read timing. Moving the total control lever 122, to #1 Reset position locates the pitmans 192 and 193 in their third position, whereupon operation of the .cams 206 and 207 causes the selected set of totalizer wheels on the #1 totalizer line to be engaged with the primary differential members 145 in reset timing. 
 The mechanism just described imparts engaging movement only to the #1 totalizer framework, and separate means, shown in Fig. 13, is provided for imparting disengaging movement to said framework. The stud in the crank 191 (Fig. 13) engages a slot in the rearward end of a link 227, the forward end of which is pivoted on a stud 228 in a cam arm 229 free on the shaft 201 and urged clockwise by a spring 232 to normally maintain a roller 230 carried thereby, in yielding contact with the camming edge of a disengaging cam 231 secured on the main cam shaft 208 and receiving one clockwise revolution of movement each machine operation. 
 When the total control lever 122 is in Register position and the pitmans 192 and 193 are positioned in their lowermost position, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, operation of the reset cam 207 will have no influence on the reset pitman 193, as the stud 198 is opposite a clearance portion of the opening 196, and as a result said stud will operate idly without moving the pitman 193. 
 Operation of the add cam 206 (Fig. 8) and its associated lever 199 will cause the stud 197, in cooperation with the raised portion of the opening 195 to shift the pitman 192 forwardly, after the primary differential members 145 have been positioned under influence of the depressed amount keys, as explained earlier herein, to cause the #1 totalizer framework to receive inward engaging movement to engage the selected set of totalizer wheels on the #1 totalizer line with the primary differential members 145, prior to their return movement, which movement revolves said selected wheels in an additive direction to add the value of the effective amount keys therein. Near the end of an adding operation the mechanism shown in Fig. 13, and explained above, imparts rearward or disengaging movement to the #1 totalizer framework to disengage the selected set of wheels from the primary differential members. 
 Moving the total control lever 122 to its Read 1 position moves the pitmans 192 and 193 upwardly one step to Where an inwardly-extending portion of the opening 196 in the pitman 193 is opposite the operating stud 198, and the raised surface in the opening of the pitman 192 is still in coacting relationship with the stud 197. Initial movement of the reset cam 207 (Figs. 7 and 8) causes the stud 198, in cooperation with the raised surface, to shift the pitmans 193 and 192 forwardly, as it will be recalled that these two pitmans are connected together for unitary movement and move in unison at all times. Forward movement of the pitman 193 rocks the #1 totalizer framework inwardly to engage the selected set of totalizer wheels with the primary differential members 145 prior to their initial movement, which movement rotates said wheels in a reverse direction to zero, to position the indicators and type wheels according to the amount standing thereon. After the primary differential members have completed their initial movement, the totalizer disengaging mechanism shown in Fig. 13 functions in synchronism with the movement of the reset cam 207 to shift the #1 totalizer framework rearwardly to disengage the zeroized totalizer wheels from the primary differential members. Immediately after the totalizer wheels have thus been disengaged, the add cam 206 becomes eifective and shifts the pitmans 192 and 193 forwardly to reengage the selected totalizer wheels with the primary differential members prior to their return movement, which movement restores said selected totalizer wheels to their original condition to preserve the amount in the totalizer for use in further computations. 
. Moving the total control lever 122 to #1 Reset position, through the mechanism shown in Figs. 7 and 8, lifts the pitmans 192 and 193 upwardly two steps from Register position, to reset position in which the extending portion of the control opening 196 in the pitman 193 is still in the path of the stud 198, and in which a clearance portion of the opening 195 in the add pitman 192 is located opposite the stud 197. Therefore, in reset operations, the reset pitman 193 will function as explained before to engage the selected totalizer wheels with the primary differential members 145 prior to their initial movement, 
which movement reversely rotates said wheels to zero. 
In reset operations, after the selected set of totalizer wheels has been reversely rotated to Zero, and prior to return movement of the primary differential members 145, the totalizer disengaging mechanism shown in Fig. 13 functions, as explained before, to disengage the selected totalizer wheels from the primary differential members 145 prior to their return movement. Inasmuch as there is a clearance portion of the control opening 195 in the pitman 192 opposite the stud 197, operation of the add cam 206 will cause the stud 197 to operate idly in said clearance portion of the opening without shifting the pitman 192 forwardly, and consequently, in reset operations the selected totalizer wheels are not reengaged with the primary differential members, and as a result remain in a zeroized condition. 
 Moving the total control lever 122 to Locked Register position raises the pitmans 192 and 193 (Fig. 7) to their uppermost position, in which position clearance portions of the openings 195 and 196 are in the path of corresponding studs 197 and 198, so that under this condition no engaging movement is imparted to the #1 totalizer framework. 
 As previously explained, the #1 totalizer line has three complete sets of totalizers thereon, said three sets comprising a Paid-Out totalizer, an Item totalizer, and a Group totalizer, which totalizers are selected for engagement with the primary differential members under control of their corresponding Paid-Out key 110, Multiple Item key 112, and Cash or Total key 114, which keys operate through the mechanism shown in Fig. 12 to aline said corresponding totalizers with said primary differential members. 
 Depressing the Sub-Total key 111 (Fig. 12) in addition to alining the item totalizer with the primary differential members, also in cooperation with the lug 214 (Fig. 7) shifts the segment 213 counter-clockwise, which through the link 211 lifts the pitmans 192 and 193 one step upwardly to Read position to cause said item totalizer to be read or sub-totalized. Counter-clockwise movement of the segment 213 (Fig. 7) causes a downward extension 235 thereof, in cooperation with a stud 236 in an arm 237, free on a key release and lock shaft journaled in the main framework, to rock said arm counter-clockwise against the tension of a spring 240. The arm 237 is connected by two rods 239 with locking arms (not shown) also free on the shaft 238, and rockable in unison with said arm 237 to lock the flexible detents for the amount banks against movement to prevent depression of the amount keys in sub-total operations. 
 Depressing the Cash Total key 114 causes the stud 163 therein in cooperation with the lug 215 to rock the segment 213 counter-clockwise exactly the same as the Sub-Total key 111 to select and condition the item totalizer for a reading operation and to lock the amount keys against depression. However said item totalizer is disengaged from the primary differential members after having been zeroized thereby and remains in a zeroized condition due to operation of the automatic transfer total mechanism shown in Fig. 12. Depression of the Cash Total key 114 rocks the segment 176 clockwise to shift the arm 178 also clockwise to position the control surfaces in the opening in said arm in relation to the stud 179 so that initial movement counterclockwise of the segment 180 after the item totalizer has been zeroized as explained above, will shift the #1 totalizer line to aline the group totalizer with the primary differential members. Inasmuch as the pitman 192 (Fig. 8) is located in Read position, operation of the add cam 206 will shift said pitman forwardly to engage the group totalizer with the primary differential members prior to their return movement, which movement enters the amount cleared from the item totalizer in said group totalizer to preserve a grand total of all items. 
 The #1 totalizer line is provided with a tens transfer mechanism for transferring tens digits from lower to higher denominations, said transfer mechanism being common to the three sets of totalizer wheels on the #1 totalizer line, and coacting therewith when said wheels are alined with the primary differential members 145 for actuation thereby. The tens transfer mechanism functions in reading and resetting operations to coact with the long teeth of the selected totalizer wheels to stop said wheels in zero position and said wheels, in turn, position the corresponding primary differential members accordingly. 
 The selecting and conditioning mechanism for the #1 totalizer line, explained in somewhat general terms above, is fully disclosed in the co-pend-ing application, Serial No. 341,633, to which reference may be had for a-more de- 13 tailed description of this mechanism, if necessary or d r sired. 
Selecting and control mechanism for the #2 totalizer line As previously explained, the #2 totalizer line is similar in construction and operation to the #1 totalizer line, and comprises five sets of totalizer wheels 154 (Fig. 4) corresponding to the five #2 control keys 115 to 119 ('Figs. 1 and 2) and alined by the depression of said keys with the primary differential members for actuation thereby. 
 The five sets of #2 totalizer wheels 154 (Fig. 4) are rotatably mounted on a sleeve 241, in turn slidably supported by the #2 totalizer line or shaft 155, said shaft in turn supported by a #2 totalizer framework 242, which is shiftably mounted between the right and left totalizer main frames 162. Mounted to slide on the shaft 155 (Fig. 11) in unison with the sleeve 241, is a shifting collar 243 having an annular groove engaged by the tines of a shifting fork 244 free on a shifting rod 245 shiftably supported by the frames 162, said shifting fork being confined between collars secured to said rod 245 so that it will shift laterally in unison therewith. Secured on the righthand end of the rod 245 is a shifting block 246 hav-' ing a slot which slidably engages a fixed stud 247 to hold said block and said rod against rotation. 
 The block 246 carries a screw stud 248 which engages a helical shifting groove in a shifting cam 249 rotatably supported on a stud 250 secured in the right frame 162. Secured to the left face of the shifting cam 249 is a pinion 251 engaged by teeth in a shifting sector 252 free on the shaft 147, and having a slot engaged by the rounded inner arm of a lever 253 rotatably supported by a stationary stud 254. The forward arm of the lever 253 has a slot which engages a stud 255 in a selecting plate 256 rockably supported by companion arms 257 and 258, in turn rotatably supported by studs'259 secured in the frame for the second transaction bank; The plate 256 has five shifting notches 262 (Fig. 11) arranged to coact respectively with corresponding studs 263 in the #2 control keys 115 to 119 inclusive, only one of which may be depressed at a time. 
 Depression of one of the keys 115 to 119 causes its stud 263, in cooperation with the corresponding shifting notch 262 to rock the plate 256 an extent corresponding to the depressed key. The movement of the plate 256 is transmitted by the lever 253 to the sector 252 to rotate the cam 249 to cause the groove therein, in cooperation with the stud 248, to shift the rod 245, the fork 244, the sleeve 241 (Fig. 4), and the totalizer wheels 154 to aline the set of totalizer wheels corresponding to the depressed key 115 to 119 with the primary differential members 145 for actuation thereby. 
 From the foregoing description it should be understood that the act of depressing the control keys 115 to 119 alines the corresponding set of totalizer wheels 154 on the #2 totalizer line with the primary differential members 1 45, and the totalizers on the #1 totalizer line 153 (Fig. 12) are selected in a similar manner. 
 Means is provided to retain the sector 252 (Fig. 11) and connected mechanism in set position during machine operation, and this mechanism comprises an aliner 264, arranged to engage teeth in a downward portion of said sector 252. The aliner 264 is free on a stud 265 in the right side frame and has secured in fixed relationship thereto a downwardly-extending arm 266, said arm and said aliner being urged clockwise by a spring 267 to normally maintain the forward edge of said arm 266 in yielding contact with a stud 268, extending between the disengaging link 227 ('Figs. 13 and 14) for the #1 totalizer line and a similar link 269 for the #2 totalizer line, said links being similar in outline and operating in unison to disengage their corresponding totalizers, as explained previously for the #1 totalizer and as will be explained presently for the #2 totalizer line. The aliner 264 functions according'to the operation of the disengaging cam 231 (Fig. 13910 engage and disengage the teeth in the sector 252 to retain said sector and connected parts, including the sleeve 241 (Fig. 4), supporting the #2 totalizers, in set position during the periods of machine operation in which the selected set of #2 totalizer wheels are engaged with the primary difierential members, for actuation thereby. 
 An alining mechanism, shown in Fig. 6, is provided for alining the shifting rod 245 for the #2 totalizer line in set position during machine operation, so that the selected set of totalizer wheels on the #2 totalizer line will remain in accurate alinement with the primary differential members. 
 Secured on the #2 shifting rod 245 (Figs. 6 and 11) are three alining disks 560, the teeth of which are arranged to be engaged by similar teeth in an alining block 561, secured on the outer end of an arm 562, free on a stationary stud 563. The arm 562 is connected by a link 564 to a similar arm 565 for the #1 totalizer line, free on a stationary stud 566. The arm 565 carries an alining block 567, which coacts with corresponding alining disks 568, secured on the #1 totalizer-shifting rod. The arm 565 is connected by a link 569 to a cam lever (not shown), which, in cooperation with corresponding cams (not shown), operates the alining arms 562 and 565 in proper timing to retain the corresponding selected sets of totalizer wheels on the #1 and #2 totalizer lines in accurate alinement with the primary differential members while said selected wheels are engaged therewith. 
 The mechanism for operating the aliner arm 565 for the #1 totalizer line is fully disclosed in the application, Serial No. 341,633, now Patent No. 2,880,930, to which reference may be had for a more complete description of this mechanism. 
Engaging and disengaging mechanism for tho #2 totalizer line Mechanism similar to that described for the #1 total izer framework is provided for imparting engaging movement to the #2 totalizer framework, to engage the selected set of totalizer wheels thereon with the primary differential members in accordance with the type of operation being performed. The totalizer disengaging mechanism shown in Fig. 13 and explained before, also functions to impart disengaging movement to the #2 totalizer framework in exactly the same manner as explained for the #1 totalizer framework. 
 The #2 totalizer framework 242 (Fig. 4) supports a shaft 271), opposite ends of which carry rollers 271 which coact with slots in the frames 162 to assist in shiftably supporting said framework 242. The rollers 271 are engaged, respectively, by slots in the upper ends of arms 272 and 273 secured on a shaft 274 jonrnaled in the totalizer frames 1,62. The arm 273 (Fig. 9) has a cam slot 275 engaged by a roller 276 carried by an arm 277 free on a rod 278 extending through the machine framework, said arm 277 being integral with a crank 279, having pivotally connected thereto the upper end of a link 280. The lower end of the link 280 is pivotally connected to a stud carried by a bell crank 283 free on the stud 189, and with the assistance of a companion crank 283 supports a stud 282 in turn pivotally supporting the rearward ends of an add-engaging pitman 284 and a reset-engaging pitman 285. A stud 286 (Figs. 9 and 10) extends between the pitmans 284 and 285, and properly spaces said pitmans apart and secures them in fixed relationship to each other. 
 The add pitman 284 has an opening 287 in an enlarged forward end thereof, said opening having control surfaces on its forward edge, which cooperate with an operating stud 289 secured in a lever 291 free on the shaft 201. The lever 291 carries a roller 293 and a spring 297 urges said lever counter-clockwise to maintain said roller in yielding engagement with the operating edge of an add plate cam 295 secured on the main cam shaft 208. The reset-engaging pitman 285 (Fig. has an opening 288 in an enlarged forward end thereof, said opening having control surfaces on its forward edge, which cooperate with an operating stud 290 fast in a lever 292 free on the shaft 201, and urged counterclockwise by a spring 298 to normally maintain a roller 294 carried thereby, in yielding contact with the operating edge of a reset plate cam 296 secured on the main cam shaft 208, which shaft, it will be recalled, makes one clockwise revolution each machine operation. Secured between the pitmans 284 and 285 is a stud 301 which pivotally supports the lower end of a link 302, the upper end of which is slotted to receive the stud 212 in the segment 213 (Figs. 7 and 9). The link 302 is similar in outline to the corresponding link 211 for the #1 totalizer line, and operates in a similar manner to control the positioning of the pitmans 284 and 285. 
 The link 302 (Fig. 9) carries a roller 303 engaged by a slot in the rearward end of an arm 304 free on the stud 220 and integral with a companion crank 305 having a stud 306 which engages a control slot 307 in the segment 223, which it will be recalled is positioned under control of the total control lever 122 (Figs. 1 and 2). The control slot 307 functions exactly like the slot 222 for controlling the positioning of the pitmans 284 and 285 for the #2 totalizer line. 
 When the total control lever 122 is in its normal or Register position, as here shown, the segment 223 is positioned as shown in Fig. 9, causing the slot 307, in cooperation with the stud 306 and the link 302 to position the pitmans 284 and 285, as here shown, (see also Fig. 
'10) to cause the selected set of wheels on the #2 totalizer lineto be engaged with the corresponding primarily differential members 145 (Fig. 4) in add timing. Moving the total control lever 122 to Locked Register position advances the segment 223 one step in a clockwise direction, causing the slot 307 and associated mechanism to lift the pitmans 284 and 285 one step, to where clearance portions of the openings 287 and 288 are opposite the corresponding studs 289 and 290, and therefore, operation of the cams 295 and 296, and their corresponding levers 291 and 292 will impart no engaging movement to the pitmans 284 and 285, and as a result, the #2 totalizer framework will remain in disengaged position. 
 Moving the total control lever 122 to Read 2 position, causes the pitmans 284 and 285 to be lifted two steps, to where operating portions of the openings 287 and 288 are opposite the studs 289 and 290, whereupon operation of the cams 295 and 296 causes the selected set of wheels on the #2 totalizer line to be engaged with the corresponding primary differential members 145 in read timing, in exactly the same manner as explained for the #1 totalizer line. Moving the total control lever 122 to Reset Zposition causes the pitmans 284 and 285 (Figs' 9 and 10) to be lifted three steps to move a clearance pontion of the opening 287 in the add pitman 284 opposite the stud 289, and to move an operating portion of the reset pitman 285 opposite the stud 290 so that operation of the cams 295 and 296 causes the selected set of wheels on the #2 totalizer line to be engaged with the primary differential members 145 in reset timing. 
 Disengaging movement is imparted to the #2 totalizer framework by the same mechanism which imparts disengaging movement to the #1 totalizer framework, said mechanism being shown in Figs. 13 and 14. As previously explained, the disengaging link 227 for the #1 totalizer line is connected in fixed relationship to the similar disengaging link 269 for the #2 totalizer line by the studs 228 and 268. The rearward end of the link 269 cam 231 is imparted to the #2 totalizer framework j through-said link 269, the bell crank 281, and the link 280 (see also Figs. 9 and 10) in exactly the same manner 16 as explained previously in connection with the #1 totalizer line. 
 Depressing either the Sub-Total key 111 or the Cash Total key 114 (Figs. 2, 7, 8 and 9), rocks the segment 213 counter-clockwise, as explained before, which through the link 302, lifts the pitmans 284 and 285 one step to Locked Register position, to render the engaging mechanism for the #2 totalizer line inoperative when either of these keys is depressed. It should be understood that when the total control lever 122 is in Register position the control slot 307 (Fig. 9) has sufficient clearance for the stud 306 to permit positioning movement of the pitmans 284 and 285 under influence of the segment 213, as explained above. This also applies to the similar mechanism shown in Fig. 7, for the #1 totalizer line, as similar clearance is provided in the slot 222 for the stud 221. As explained in connection with the #1 totalizer line, counterclockwise movement of the segment 213 rocks the arm 237 also counter-clockwise, against the action of its spring 240, to lock the amount keys against depression under these conditions. 
 A spring 308 tensioned between the lower end of the link 302 and a stationary stud urges said link and the pitmans 284 and 285 downwardly to normally maintain said parts in Register position. 
 Depressing the Paid-Out key (Figs. 9 and 10) causes the stud 163 in the stem thereof, in cooperation with a camming lug 309 on a segment 310 free on the shaft 147, to rock said segment counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise movement of the segment 310 causes a foot-shaped downward extension 311 thereof, in cooperation with a roller 312 carried by the link 302, to 
-lift said link against the tension of the spring 308 to raise the #2 engaging pitmans 284 and 285 one step to Locked Register position, to prevent engaging movement being imparted to the #2 totalizer line when said Paid- Out key is depressed. 
 The #2 totalizer line is provided with a tens transfer mechanism for transferring tens digits from lower to higher denominations, said tens transfer mechanism being common to the five sets of totalizers on said #2 totalizer line, and coacting with the wheels of each of said totalizers, when they are moved into alinement with the primary differential members for actuation thereby. 
 The tens transfer mechanism for the #2 line is identical to that provided for the #1 totalizer line which, as previously explained, is fully disclosed in the copending application, Serial No. 341,633, now Patent No. 2,880,930, and comprises a transfer pawl 570 (Fig. 5) for each denominational order for transferring tens digits from lower to higher denominations. In sub-total and total operations, often referred to as read and reset operations, the Wheels of the selected totalizer are reversely rotated until stopped by long teeth thereon coming in contact with the edge of a corresponding stop bail (not shown) to position said wheels in zero and to in turn adjust the primary differential members accordingly. 
 During the time that the selected totalizer wheels are being reversely rotated, it is necessary that the transfer pawls 570 (Fig. 5) be retained out of the path of the teeth of said wheels so as not to interfere with their rotation. The transfer pawls 570 for the #2 totalizer line each has a downward projection 571 arranged to be engaged by a corresponding slot in a bar 572 supported at each end by corresponding arms 573 in turn pivotally mounted on trunnion studs 574 secured in the machine framework. The lefthand arm 573 is pivotally connected by a link 575 to a corresponding left arm 576 for the #1 totalizer line, which, with a corresponding right arm 576 are rotatably supported on corresponding trunnion studs 577 secured in the machine framework. The arms 576 support a bar 578 with slots which engage downward projections on the corresponding #1 transfer pawls (not shown) similar in every respect to the transfer pawls 570 for the upper or #2 totalizer lines. The left arm 576 (Fig. 5) is pivotally connected by a link 579 to a stud 580 (Fig. 7) in the #1 resetcam lever 200 for the #1 totalizer line. The lever 20 functions in proper timing to engage the slots in the bars 572 and 57 8 (Fig. 5'), with the projections 571 on the transfer pawls 571) to retain said pawls in fully disengaged position so that the teeth thereof will not stumble on the teeth of the wheels of the selected totalizer on the #1 and #2 totalizer lines. 
 For a full disclosure of the mechanism for retaining the transfer pawls for the #1 totalizer line in disengaged position during reading and resetting operations, reference may be had to the application, Serial No. 341,688. 
 The total control lever 122 (Fig. 2) controls the positioning of a #2 locking plate 313 (Fig. '15) to lock the #2 control keys 115 to 119 against depression when said total control lever is in certain positions. The plate 313 is free ,on the shaft 147, and has a slot which engages a stud 314 in an arm 315 secured on the shaft 226, which, it will be recalled, is operated by the total control lever 122. The mutilated periphery of the locking plate 313 cooperates with the studs 263 in the stems of the control keys 115 to 119 for the #2 totalizer line. 
 When the total control lever 122 is in Register position, the locking plate 313 is positioned as shown in Fig. 15, in which clearance portions of the periphery thereof are opposite the studs 263, and consequently any of the #2 control keys 115 to 119 may be d-pressed to select the corresponding set of totalizer wheels on the #2 totalizer line. Moving the total control lever to Locked Register position rocks the plate 313 one step in a clockwise direction to move obstructing portions of the periphery thereof into the path of all of the studs 263 to obstruct depression of any of the #2 control keys under this condition. Moving the total control lever 122 to either Read 2 or Reset 2 position imparts, respectively, either two or three steps of movement to the plate 313 in a clockwise direction, in either of which positions clearance portions of the periphery of said plate permit depression of the #2 control keys 115 to 119 inclusive, to select the corresponding totalizers on the #2 line for either read or reset operations. Moving the total control lever 122 (Fig. 2') to ether Read 1 or Reset 1 position imparts, respectively, either one or two steps of movement to the plate 313 (Fig. 15) in a counter-clockwise direction, to move obstructing portions of the periphery of said plate in the path of the studs 263 to obstruct depression of the #2 control keys, when said total control lever is thus positioned. Positioning of the locking plate 313 by the total control lever 122 when either in Read 1 or Reset 1 position, locates 317 in the arm 257 (Figs. 11 and 15) for the #2 selecting plate 256 to maintain the proper alinement of said selecting plate 256 and connected parts shown in Fig. ll, under these conditions. 
 A locking plate 318 (Fig. 19) is provided for the #1 control keys 110 to 114 (Fig. 2) which plate operates similarly to the plate 313 for the #2 control keys (Fig. 15) for controlling the depression of said #1 keys. 
 The plate 318 has a slot engaged by a stud 319 in arm 320 secured on the shaft 226, which shaft, it will be recalled, is positioned under control of the total control lever'122 (Fig. 2). The mutilated periphery of the locking plate 318 cooperates with the studs 163 in the #1 control keys 110 to 114 inclusive, to control depression of these keys, depending upon the position of the total control lever. The single item key 113 is used to initiate machine operation when the #2 control keys 115 to 119 are being used to select the corresp0nd ing totalizers on the #2 totalizer line in reading and resetting operations, as itwill be recalled that the #2 control keys are not motorized and hence do not initiate machine operation. Consequently, the only time the single Item key is locked against depression is when the total control lever 122 is in Locked Register position, as will be explained presently. 
 When the total control lever 122 is in Register position, the locking plate 318 is positioned as shown in Fig. 19, in which clearance portions of the periphery thereof are opposite the studs 163 for the #1 control keys to- 114 inclusive. When the total control lever 122 is moved to either one or two steps respectively in a counter-clockwise direction to move obstructing portions of the periphery thereof opposite the studs 163 in the Sub-Total key 111, the Multiple Item key' 112, and the Total Cash key 114, and therefore, only the Paid-Out key 110 and the Single Item key 113 may be depressed under either of these conditions to select the group totalizer on the #1 line for read or reset operations. 
 Moving the total control lever to Locked Register position advances the locking plate 318 (Fig. 19) one step in a clockwise direction to lock all of the #l'control keys against depression. The single Item key 113 is locked against full depression and thus rendered ineffective when the total control lever 1 22 is in Locked Register position, by a short projection 321 (Fig. 1-9) in cooperation with the stud 163 in said key. The projection 321 is located in the bottom of the large opening in the periphery of the plate 318, which opening provides clearance for the stud 163 to permit depression of the Single Item key at all times except when the total control lever 122 is in Locked Register position. 
 Moving the total control lever 122 to either Read 2 or Reset 2 position advances the locking plate 318 either two steps or three steps respectively, in a clockwise direction to lock all of the 1 control keys against depression, with the exception of the Single Item key 113 which is used in this case, in conjunction with the 2 control keys 1 15 to 119, as explained before, to initiate machine operation to read and reset the corresponding totalizerson the #2 totalizer line. i 
 By referring to Fig. 7 it will be seen that counterclockwise movement of the segment 213, upon depression of either the Sub-Total key 1-1-1 or the Cash Total key 114 moves a projection 322 beneath the stud 163 in the Multiple Item key 112 to obstruct the depression of said key when either of the above keys is depressed. 
 An interlocking mechanism is provided between the two rows of control or transaction keys to insure proper operationof the machine, and this interlocking mechanism comprises a control plate 323 (Fig. 20)"which is rockablysupported-by a crank 32 4 and an arm of abell crank 325 in turn pivotally supported by the studs 259. A spring 328 urges the control plate 323 upwardly or counter-clockwise 'to normally maintain the rearward edge thereof in yielding contact with a stop stud 329 secured in the control key framework. i 
 A downward extension of the bellcrank 325 (Fig. 20) cooperates with an ear 331 bent outwardly from an arm 332 secured on the key release and lock shaft 238. Under normal conditions, when the total control lever is in Register position, and none of the control keys are depressed, the extension of the bell crank 325 lies in the path of the ear 331, as shown here, to obstruct clockwise machine releasing movement of the shaft 238. Depressing any one of the #2 control keys 115 to 119 (Figs. 2" and 20) causes the stud 2 63 therein,in cooperation with an angular camming surface on a corresponding camming lug 333 on the control plate 323, to shift said control plate downwardly or clockwise, against the action of the spring 328, to rock the bell crank 325 also clockwise, to move the downward extension of said bell crank out of the path of the ear 331 to free the arm 332 and the shaft 238 for clockwise machine releasing movement. 
 Depressing any one of the #1 control keys 110, 111 or 114 (Figs. 2 and 20) causes the stud 163 therein, in cooperation with an angular camming surface on a corre-
