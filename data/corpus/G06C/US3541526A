GROTH ATTORNEYS United States Patent Office Patented Nov. 17, 1970 U.S. Cl. S40-172.5 11 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE Mechanilsm is provided for a point of sale machine which is basically a printing computer capable of addition and subtraction and having a conventional full (l1 column) numerical keyboard. One column of the numerical keys is additionally provided with indications of types of transactions so that depression of the keys determines a sequence of selective controls, the keys of this column also providing for printing of decimal designations for the types of transaction. Another column of numerical keys contains indications of the nature of various entries and controls operations corresponding thereto. The various numerical columns have associated with them selectively illuminated legends indicative of entries to be made in groups of columns. Besides the numerical keys, there are keys which are selectively illuminated to provide instructions for input operations on the keyboard by a sales person. These last keys initiate and control operations of the machine. Printing is effected to produce duplicate sales slips. Arrangements are provided for read-out of information inserted in the machine through manipulations of its keysl Associated with the machine is circuitry comprising relays which function to control successive steps of operation during a single transaction. Various auxiliary controls are provided to take proper care of unusual conditions. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the application of Lange, Robinson and Groth Ser. No. 218,064, filed Aug. 20, 1962, Pat. 3,335,407, dated Aug. 8, 1967, a system is provided including a point-ofsale machine which latter involves a computer having a numerical keyboard and an auxiliary keyboard, which latter has its keys illuminated selectively to control sequential operations of a sales transaction. Elaborate computational provisions are made with provision for transmission of information from the point-of-sale machine to a central unit. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention constitutes an improvement over the system of the patent referred to above, It is far simpler in that, at the point of sale, the machine is a relatively simple computer which has its information read out by a central control. The information is stored for subsequent sorting, computation, and resolution into records from which billing and inventory information can be derived. The computer is of the well-known Clary type, and reference may be made to the following patents for internal mechanical aspects of the computer which are basically involved in the present instance: 2,843,245; 2,879,993; 2,894,449; 2,916,989; 2,983,439; 3,010,647; 3,017,081; 3,023,953; and 3,064,892. 
 The objects of the invention will be best appreciated from the following description.

DESCRIPTION O-F THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The machine at the point of sales comprises a modified Clary printer associated with a cash drawer. The printer is of well-known type and reference may be made to the patents referred to above for basic mechanical and electrical aspects of the printer, and it will suffice for description of the present invention to point merely to such changes as are made in the conventional printer as have to do with the present invention. It will be found, for example, that certain keys of the conventional keyboard are omitted though the functions thereof are performed by other keys which have additional functions, The printer includes various additional switches for performing programming functions. As the description proceeds, references will be specially made to the modifications of the printer with reference to the conventional aspects thereof. For an understanding of what is involved it will be convenient to refer rst to FIG. 1 showing the keyboard of the machine as it appears to a clerk, giving instructions for operation. 
 The printer 2 is provided with a bank 4 of numerical keys arranegd in eleven columns of nine keys each designated 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26 of which, hereafter, the most right-hand column 6 will be designated the first column, the most left-hand column 26 being designated the eleventh column. In the conventional printer such a bank of keys is numerical from the standpoint of function, and in the present machine all of the keys of this bank including those of columns 16 and 26 also have numerical significance, being operable at proper times to enter numerical information. However, the columns 16 and 26 (the sixth and eleventh) have additional non-numerical functions. As shown, the keys from one to nine in colum 26 have special designations relating to the type of transaction involved being designated respectively as follows for the choice and termination of the following: 
 The key in row one is operated when a charge account transaction is involved. 
 The second key is marked Charge Credit and represents a transaction in which a customers charge account is credited for the amount of a returned item. 
 The third key is marked Cash Credit to represent a transaction in which cash is given to a customer for a returned item. 
 The fourth key designated Cash Count is used as will appear hereafter in the matter of closing for an employee his accounting for a period of duty, with involvement of making a record of cash in the cash drawer. 
 The fifth key is marked No Sale and is operated when a transaction involves free alterations, exchanges of ltems, or the like, involving no cash or credit exchange, and serves to effect the issuance of a sales slip on which there will be written a notation of the nature of the transaction. 
 The sixth key in the illustrated machine is blank and may be used for some special transaction which might be involved. 
 The seventh key is marked Payment on Account and is used in a transaction in which a customer having a charge account makes a payment in reduction of his account. 
 The eighth key is marked C.O.D. and is operated for C.O.D transactions.. 
 The ninth key, designated Cash" is operated when a cash transaction is involved. 
 The keys of the sixth column also contain designations in addition to the numerical designations for the identification of various miscellaneous items. 
 The first key is marked 0.0.5. standing for Out of State. It is involved, usually, when a customer out of the state makes a purchase which is to be delivered to his home, such transaction usually involving no payment of a local tax on an item which would normally be subject to such tax. 
 The second key is used when a repair transaction is involved which involves a monetary charge. 
 The third key marked Deposit is involved in a transaction in which some deposit is made as in a C.O.D. transaction or in which a deposite is made to hold an item for future pick up. 
 The fourth key designated Alteration" is used when some alteration in an item is to be made with a monetary involvement. 
 The fth key marked Handling Charge is used for entering an amount involving handling of an item such as postage, express charges, or the like. 
The sixth key indicated No Tax may be used to identify a transaction involving some tax-free goods or a customer, such as an institution, exempt from taxation. 
 The seventh and eighth keys involve, respectively, State Tax and Federal Tax. These are used in the entry of the respective taxes on items. 
 The ninth key which is designated Employee" is for an employees discount. 
 As will appear more fully hereafter, the keys of this column may have many miscellaneous aspects of significance, and in particular may involve, used in numerically of coded form, various miscellaneous matters, such as segregatoin of different types of cash or tokens in the cash drawer during the cash count operation. 
 Above the numerical keyboard there is a display panel 28 having various delimited translucent areas arranged to be selectively illuminated by lamps associated with masks to confine illumination selectively to the various areas. 
 The areas carry lettering and, except for one, indicate to an employee stctions of the keyboard in which entries are to be made. 
 The area 30 has wording indicating that the type of transaction should be entered by manipulation of a key of the column 26 directly below this area. 
 An area 32, having no direct relationship to the keyboard, is designated Sales Checks and is illuminated to warn an operator that the supply of sales checks has run out. 
 An area 34 having wording indicative of a miscellaneous charge is vertically above the sixth column 16, and this area is illuminated when an entry in that column is called for. 
 The area 36 is desingated Employee No. and extends over the rst five columns to indicate that, when it is illuminated, the employees number should be entered in those columns. 
 An extended area, 38, above the first nine columns contains the wording CustomerC.O.D.Lay No. and indicates, variously, depending upon the type of transaction, that certain data should be entered in these columns. If a transaction involves a customers account, the account number is to be entered, if known, in the appropriate number of columns. lf the transaction involves a club plan, the same type of entry may be made. If the transaction involves a charge, but the customers number is unknown, or not required, the code number 67" may be entered in the iirst two columns. lf the transaction is C.O.D. or of a layaway type, the appropriate code number 42 or 59" is to be entered in the first two columns. 
 The area 40 indicates the department involved, and the number for this department should be entered in the last three columns. 
 The area 42 indicates, when illuminated, that the class of goods is to be entered in the seventh and eighth columns. 18 and 20. 
 The number of duplicate items being sold is entered in the sixth column as indicated by the illumination of the area 44. 
 The area 46 designated Amount indicates that when illuminated the amount of the transmission should be entered in the first ve columns, the first two being for cents and the last three for dollars. 
 The lamps which respectively illuminate the various areas are shown in a schematic electrical diagram as described hereafter. 
 At the right of the printer there is a column of keys which differ from those of the conventional printer though some of them have functions which overlap the conventional keys. All of these keys are selectively illuminated by lamps as discussed hereafter in connection with the schematic electrical diagrams. The keys are desirably translucent and bear opaque lettering indicactve of particular conditions including instructions to the employee. The three top keys of this set are special, and are not, strictly, program keys. When the key 48 is depressed in order to void any given transaction by executive action, a voiding operation will take place as hereafter described. 
 Illumination of the key 50 calls attention to an incorrect entry of an account number. 
 Key 52 calls for operation by the employee who wishes to void an incomplete transaction due to some error. 
 The remaining keys at the right of the printer are selectively illuminated program keys involved in directing the employee to execute the operations in the sense of producing entries and printing. 
 Illumination of key S4 indicates wrong unit control number and involves merely checking of the validity of a number by a coding system. Operation of this key when it is illuminated directs the employee to re-enter the unit control information by causing illumination of key 64. 
 Key 56 is illuminated when the sales clerk requires authorization to proceed with a transaction. Such illumination may occur when an account is considered unsatisfactory. 
 Key 58, when illuminated, directs the entry of the employees number, and when depressed effects printing of the number and sets up the printer for transmission to a central control system. Key 60 does the same for the customers number. 
 Keys 62 and 64 direct entry of merchandise identification and unit control number, respectively. When depressed they provide printing and the setting up of the printed for transmission. 
 Key 66 indicates when illuminated the possibility of securing a subtotal, and depression of the key produces printing and entry of the subtotal. From the arithmetical standpoint it has the function of the usual subtotal key of the conventional printer. 
 Key 68 and 70 direct and take care of the matter of miscellaneous entries and employee discounts and deposits. 
 Key 72 indicates that a total may be provided, and its depression produces the printing of a total and also effects termination of the operation for each transaction. Its numerical effect is essentially that of the conventional total key. It also causes ejection of the sales slip. 
 The usual clearing key 74 is provided to clear the entire numerical keyboard for correction of errors. 
 In studying the schematic diagrams, it will be noted that operation is `by direct current and, in general, return of various circuits is to a common negative supply termi nal which will be hereafter merely referred to as negative. Energization involves either permanent connection to a positive supply terminal or controlled connection thereto through a main operating switch. Energization will, in general, refer to connection to positive supply. In the diagrams, unless otherwise noted, electrical elements are illustrated in the conditions assumed when the system is idle. 
 Referring to FIG. 3, the printer contains a number of control solenoids which are designated 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 107 and 109, with one terminal of each connected to the negative terminal 106. The selective energizing terminals of these solenoids are respectively designated 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 111 and 113. Terminal 111 appears also in FIG. 2A; terminals 110, 114 and 116 also appear in FIG. 2D; and terminals 108, 112 and 113 also appear in FIG. 2F. 
 Further control solenoids 118, 120 and -128 appear in FIG. 7. These have returns to the negative terminal 106 and have activating connections 124, 126 and 130, respec tively. The last two also appear in FIGS. 2F and 2D, respectively. 
 The functions of the solenoids will appear more fully hereafter, but for convenience of reference they may be described, respectively, as follows: solenoid 100 is involved in entry of an employees number; solenoid 101 is involved in the taking of a total; solenoid 102 is involved in the taking of a sub-total; solenoid 103 is involved in entry of a tax; solenoid 104 is involved in etecting subtraction; solenoid 107 is involved in a voiding operation; solenoid 109 is involved in performing addition; solenoid 118 is involved in date control; solenoid 120 is involved when an entry is made without addition; and solenoid 128 is involved in ribbon shift. 
 Switches which are cam-controlled during various parts of the cycle of the printer are shown at |32, 134, 136, 138, 140 and 142 in FIG. 7. 
 Further switches involved in the printer are 141, 143, 144, 145, 146 and 147, shown in FIG. 7 which are selectively involved in the operation of various columns in the printer. 
 Switch 141 is moved downwardly when any key in the eleventh column 26 is depressed. Switch 143 is moved downwardly when any key in any of the ninth to eleventh columns 22, 24 or 26 is depressed. Switch 144 is moved downwardly when any key in either the seventh or eighth column 18 or 20 is depressed. Switch 145 is moved downwardly when any key in the sixth column 16 is depressed. Switches 146 and 147 are both moved downwardly when any key in any of the l'irst ve colums 6, 8, 10, l2 or 14 is depressed. 
 Referring to FIG. 4, the keys of the eleventh column 26 of the printer, when depressed, close the respective switches 152, 154, 156, 158, 162, 164 and 166 arranged in the order of the digit keys 2 to 5 and 7 to 9, there being no switches of this group associated with keys 1 and 6. Connections are made between the common terminal 168 which is connected to the fixed contact 170 of switch 142 (FIG. 7). The other txed contact of switch 142 is connected to the terminal 172 (see also FIG. 2F).

 A terminal 394 is arranged to be engaged by the switch 136 when depressed to connect this terminal to terminal 388. 
 Terminal 396 is arranged to be connected to terminal 388 when the switch 136 is in its upper position. 
 Switch 140 in its lower position connects the line 124 to the terminal 398. 
 When switch 138 is depreseed, connection is provided between terminal 400 and a switch terminal 403. 
 A controlled lock (not shown) has three possible positions, a central position in which the printer is in an operative condition, a left-hand position in which the printer is deenergized, and a right-hand position in which it will effect the opening of a cash drawer. From the electrical standpoint this lock is associated with a pair of switches (which physically are microswitches) but which may be diagrammed as indicated at 399 and 401 as having movable contacts having positions corresponding to those of the lock. The movable contacts are connected to the positive supply terminal. In its left-hand `position the movable contacts open their circuits. In its central and right-hand positions contact 399 connects position to terminal 388 which is the main positive terminal during operation, controlled energizing power being provided the contact 401 is open. but in its right-hand position from this terminal. In its central and left-hand positions 8 connection is provided between the positive supply terminal and the xed contact 403 of switch 138. 
 A terminal 402 is arranged to be connected to a terminal 404 upon depression of switch 147. A terminal 416 is arranged to be connected to a lower terminal of switch 143 upon depression of switch 144. A terminal 418 is arranged to be connected to a terminal 420 by depression of switch 145. A terminal 360 (FIG. 5) is connected to the other terminal of switch 143. 
 When the switch 143 is in its upper position it connects terminal 422 to a connection 423 which runs to a contact engageable by switch 144 in its upper position connecting this through connection 425 to a contact of switch 145, and when this last switch is in its upper position connection is provided to an upper contact of switch 147 through line 426, the switch 147 then connecting this line to the terminal 402. Line 426 is connected to a terminal 417. 
 When the switch 146 is depressed it interconnects the terminals 286 and 288 (FIG. 5). 
 The terminal 402 is connected through the line 428 to a contact 430 of switch 432 and connects this terminal through line 434 to upper and lower contacts of switch 141. When the switch 141 is in its upper position connection is made through line 436 to terminal 313 (FIG. 5). When the switch 141 is in its lower position connection is made to terminal 286 through the line 438. 
 Switch 432 is in its upper, operative position, when a sales check is in a proper lengthwise position for proper printing. 
 For illumination of the instruction panel above the key- `board there are provided various lamps numbered 440 to 456. These lamps provide illumination of areas of the panel 28 as follows: 
 Lamp 440 provides the instruction for entry of the department number in area 40; lamp 442 illuminates area 42 to instruct the entry of a class number; lamp 444 illuminates area 44 to direct the entry of quantity; lamp 446 illuminates area 30 to provide instruction for the entry of the type of transaction; lamp 448 indicates the absence of sales checks by illuminating area 32 as already mentioned; lamp 450 illuminates area 34 to direct the insertion of miscellaneous coding; lamp 452 illuminates area 38 to direct the entry of the customers account number; lamp 454 illuminates area 46 to direct entry of the amount of a transaction; and lamp 456 illuminates area 36 to direct the entry of the employees number. 
 All of the lamps are returned to negative. Lamps 440 and 442 are respectively energized through resistors 458 and 460 from the terminal 294. Lamp 444 is energized from the same terminal without the interposition of a resistor. Lamp 446 is connected through resistor 462 to terminal 313. Lamp 448 is connected to the upper contact of switch 389. Lamp 450 is connected through resistor 464 to terminal 300. Lamp 452 is connected to terminal 290. Lamp 454 is connected through diode 466 to terminal 300, and is also connected through diode 468 to terminal 294. The diodes provide isolation of the two terminals from each other, with the lamp 454 being capable of energization through either diode. Lamp 456 is connected to terminal 286. 
 A connection 470 from the right-hand fixed contact of switch 401 runs to the drawr-releasing solenoid 472. 
 Reference may now be made to the six FIGS. 2A to 2F, inclusive, which may be best considered by viewing them in two rows, one of FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C in that order, with FIGS. 2D, 2E, and 2F located respectively below them in a second row. The elements of these figures are primarily relays and their connections, which relays are designated by the even numerals running from 474 to 520, inclusive. Running through each relay vertically and continuing through upper and lower corresponding figures are lines which are designated by the numbers of the relays primed. Along these lines are numerous movable contacts of the relays, all shown in their original rest positions, but operated by energization of the relays to their alternative positions. The movable contacts above the relays are moved downwardly upon relay enregization, while those below the relays are moved upwardly. In these figures the contacts are marked by numerals in parentheses, and in the description the individual contacts will be designated by the number of the relay followed by such numeral. For simplicity inactive contacts merely acting as stops are omitted. While single relays are illustrated for simplicity, some of them have such large numbers of contacts that in fact a single relay may be physically constituted by two or more relays arranged in parallel. It will be observed that various of the relays have associated with them either diodes for transient suppression or resistance-capacitance combinations to proivde time delays. These expedients are conventional and will not be described in detail. Connections of the relays and their contacts need not be described in detail since functional operations will become apparent hereafter. 
 For convenience of reference, the relays may be briefly referred to in connection `with their functions as follows: 
 474 is a relay involved in initiation of transmission of information as will be described more fully hereafter.

 Relay 516 is involved in control of the production of a heading line. 
Relay 518 is involved when a payment is being made. 
Relay 520 is involved in the release of the cash drawer. 
 Involved also in the operation is a silicon controlled rectifier 522 shown in FIG. 2A. A diode 524 connects the cathode of this controlled rectifier to negative providing a bias. The anode of the controlled rectifier is connected through resistor 526 of high value to the positive supply terminal. The gate of the controlled rectifier is connected through resistors 528 and 530| to negative. Other connections to the elements of the controlled rectier will become apparent from the subsequent description of operation. 
 A diode 532 is provided in the energizing line for relay 486 running from the terminal 316. 
 Referring next to FIG. 2B, there are provided as shown therein various current-routing diodes 534, 536, 538, S40, 542 and 544 the functions of which will become evident hereafter. 
 As shown in FIG. 2C, diodes 546, 548 and 550 are associated with the terminals 310, 300, 290 and 292 to provide current isolating during operation. Shown in this vligure are also functional diodes 552 and 554. 
 Referring to FIG. 2D, there are diodes 556, 558, 560, 562, 564 and 566 associated with various terminals as shown at the lower left of that figure. A further functional diode is involved at 568. 
 In FIG. 2E, there are the functional diodes S70, 572, 573 and 574. 
 In FIG. 2F, there are the functional diodes 576, 578, 580, 582, S84, 585, 586, 588 and 590. 
 Various transmission terminals 592 and 593 appear in FIG. 2E, while further transmission terminals S94 appear in FIG. 2F. Additional transmission terminals are illustrated at 596 and 598. 
 Additional transmission terminals are provided at 600, 602, 604, 606 and 608 (FIG. 2A) and at 610 (FIG. 2D). 
 The operation may be conveniently described by referring to a typical transaction, first disregarding, except where pertinent, various secondary controls. 
 When the system is at rest, with a sales slip properly located, there is displayed on the panel the direction for entry of the type of transaction by illumination of the area 30 by the lamp 446 indicating that a choice should be made in the eleventh keyboard column 26. The electrical connections involved are the following: 
 With the key in the central operating position, a positive potential is applied through the closed switch 399 to the terminal 388 and, tracing this terminal connection to the left, it passes to switch 389, which will be in its lower position by reason of the presence of sales forms so that the potential is applied through contact 393 by way of line 395 to contact 397 of switch 132 which will be closed to provide the potential to terminal 390. The terminal 390 appears in FIG. 2A and the circuit may be traced through normally closed contacts 482(1) and 484(1). To the right of the last there is a branch which at this time is open. Another branch runs to terminal 402 which appears at the bottom of FIG. 7. 
 From terminal 402 a branch runs through the normally closed switch 147 and then by way of connection 426 through normally closed switch 145, connection 425, switch 144, connection 423, and switch 143 to terminal 422. Terminal 422 appears in FIG. 2B and its connections are opened at this time at contacts 496(4) and 504(3). Returning to terminal 402 (FIG. 7) the alternate path may be traced through connection 428, through r switch 432, which is closed when a sales form is in proper position, and then through connection 434, switch 141, connection 436 and through resistor 462 to the lamp 446 which is thereby illuminated. If a sales slip is not in proper lengthwise position, switch 432 is open and lamp 446 will not be lighted. 
 To initiate an operation, the clerk must depress a selected key in the eleventh column 26. To describe consistently a typical operation, it will be assumed that the clerk depresses the key for a charge transaction, i.e., the key bearing the numeral l in that column. The depression of this key depresses the switches 141 and 143 (FIG. 7). 
 Considering, first, switch 141, the already energized circuit at its left now energizes connection 438 running to terminal 286 and to lamp 456, the latter being energized to illuminate the area 36 to direct the entry of the employees number in the first to fifth key columns. The terminal 286 (FIG. 5) energizes lamp 260 to illuminate the employees number program key 58. 
 The movement of switch 143 to its lower position produces no result at this time. 
 The employees number should now be entered in the first five columns of the keyboard. Aside from setting up the keyboard for printing and transmission, this operation additionally moves to their lower positions the switches 146 and 147. The depression of switch 147 at this time produces no result. 
 Switch 146 is connected at its left to terminal 288, which is connected to the now open switches 328 and 332, the latter being operable by the employees number key of the program group. The right-hand lower contact of switch 146 runs to positive potential by reason of connection to terminal 286 which is already positive as described above. 
 The employees number program key 58 is now depressed to initiate a cycle of operation of the printer and electrical readout. The result of depression of the employees number key is closure of switch 332 which connects the now positive terminal 288 to terminal 324. Referring to FIG. 2C, it will be seen that energization of terminal 324 energizes the relay 516 through diode 554. One result of this is to tire the controlled rectifier 522 from terminal 324 through the closing of contacts 516(4). The connection through a number of closed relay contacts to the junction of resistors 528 and S30 may be readily traced and need not be described in detail, the connections rendering the controlled rectifier gate positive, changing its previous negative bias. 
 Referring to FIG. 7, it will be noted that the anode of the controlled rectiiier is positive through the connection of terminal 392 to the terminal 388 through the switch 134 which is at this time in its closed upper position. (The resistor 526 connected between the anode of the controlled rectifier and the positive terminal has a large value, e.g., one megohm, which maintains a bias but through which, alone, the rectier would not lire.) 
 The cathode circuit of the controlled rectifier may be traced through a number of closed relay contacts to the contacts 516(5), now closed, and to the terminals 108 and 126. The terminal 108 (FIG. 3) is the energizing terminal for the employees number solenoid 100; the terminal 126 (FIG. 7) is the energizing terminal for the non-add solenoid 120. Connection of the controlled rectifier cathode through various closed relay contacts and the diode 572 may be traced to the key control relay 484, and this is also energized by the firing of the controlled rectifier. 
 Closure of contact 5l6(1) has no effect due to energization of relay 484. 
The opening of 516(2) produces no result at this time. 
 The closure of 516(3) provides a holding circuit from terminal 388 through a series of closed contacts of various relays. Accordingly, relay 516 remains energized when its original energizing circuit becomes opened. 
 The remaining contacts 516(6) are involved in the read-out operation which will be later described. 
 Closure of contacts 484(2) renders terminal 604 positive but the operation is involved in read-out and description will be deferred. 
 Closing of contacts 484(3) connects terminal 394 t0 relay 474, but there is no immediate result since terminal 394 is open at switch 136 (FIG. 7). Contacts 484(4) are closed to provide a holding circuit for relay 484 from the terminal 388. 
 The conditions of the control elements resulting from depression of the employees number program key (closing switch 332) and previously described operations may be summarized as follows: 
 The controlled rectifier, once fired, remains so until its anode-cathode supply is cut off, and solenoids 100 and 126 are energized thereby. Relay 516 is energized through its holding circuit from terminal 388 through 486(1), 488(2), 494(2), 496(6), 498(4), 504(4), 502(4), 510 (3), and its own contacts 5l6(3). Key l in column 1l remains depressed, and switches 141, 143, 146 and 147 remain depressed. Relay 484 is energized through its own holding circuit. 
 The cycle of operation of the printer now starts, being initiated by the energization of the employee solenoid 100. 
The switches 132, 134, 136, 138, 140 and 142 are operated by cams moving through 360 during the complete cycle of the printer. All of these switches occupy the positions indicated at the initiation of the printer cycle (0). They will be in their lowered positions during operation 0f the printer as follows: 
 132 is open from 10 to 340; 134 is open from 10 to 355', 136 is down from 320 to 350; 138 is closed from 20 to 280; 140 is closed from 160 to 210; and 142 is closed from 20 to 150. 
 Once started, the Clary printer goes through its complete cycle. This printer is mechanically conventional and involves column racks which move from positions previously held to initial positions and then move to positions corresponding to the keys depressed, which positions are thereafter maintained through the remainder of the cycle for printing and transmission of electrical signals, these positions being then retained after the end of the cycle and until a new cycle is initiated. Following the setting up of the racks the numerical keys, including those of the eleventh column, are released. The electrical contacts carried by the racks move variably with them. To avoid contact wear, the cooperating fixed contacts are carried by a plate which moves them out of the path of the movable contacts, being restored only when the movements of the movable contacts terminate. The program keys are not held down since they merely fire the controlled rectilier which remains conductive, preserving for the required time the operations which are initiated. 
 The sequence of events during a printer cycle are as follows: 
 At 10 the opening of switch 132 deenergizes the terminal 390. The deenergization is not immediately significant since contact 484(1) is open. 
 At 10 the switch 134 also opens, deenergizing terminal 392, removing the anode supply from the controlled rectifier 522 and thus turning it off. The solenoids and 126 are deenergized, but they have already performed their functions in controlling the printer. 
 At 20, the switch 138 closes. However, connections to 400 are open and no functional result occurs. 
 At 20, switch 142 connects the terminals 170 and 172. 170 is connected to terminal 168 which is common to all of the eleventh column switches (FIG. 4). However there is no switch associated with the charge key so no result now occurs. It will be noted that terminal 172 (FIG. 2F) has a connection to the left of contacts 516(3), and therefore to the holding circuit of relay 516 previously described, which holding circuit is operative. 
 At the switch 142 opens, without any result except that of deenergizing all of the switches in the eleventh column. (This is not of significance in the present operation; but it is in alternative operations.) 
 At switch 140 closes. The left-hand contact of this switch is connected through 124 to the date control solenoid 118. Its right-hand contact runs to terminal 398. This terminal is energized through the connections running from terminal 388, i.e., through 486(1), 488(2), 494(2), 496(6), 498(4), 504(4), 502(4), 5l0(3) and diode 580. The date control solenoid 118 is accordingly energized to print the date and other heading information. 
 At 210, the switch 140 opens deenergizing the solenoid 118. 
At 280, the switch 138 opens without functional result. 
 At 320, switch 136 moves downwardly and connection 396 is deenergized while connection 394 is energized from terminal 388. 
 The deenergizing of 396 (FIG. 2B) has at this time no result. 
 Since relay 484 is energized, relay 474 is energized through 484(3) from terminal 394. This is self-held through 474(3) and through 482(3) running to positive. 474(2) opens with no result. 474(1) and 474(4) are involved in control of transmission. 
 The next events occur at 340, at which time switch 132 closes, energizing terminal 390. At this time switches 134, 138, 140 and 142 are open. Switch 136 is down, so that terminal 394 is energized while 396 is deenergized. Relay S16 remains energized, and while due to completion of transmission they may be otherwise, it will be assumed that relays 474 and 484 are also now energized. 
 Closing of switch 132 connects terminal 390 to energizing terminal 388 but 484(1) is open in accordance with the assumption just made. 
 After 340, transmission will be completed. Access relays 500 and 506 will have been energized and consequently their contacts 501](1) and 506(4) will be closed so that a transmission termination signal from terminal 596 will energize relay 482, to open its contacts 482(1) and 482(2) and shift its contacts 482(3) and 482(4). The only significant result is opening of the holding circuit of relay 484 which becomes deenergized. Relay 482 has no self-holding circuit and becomes deenergized after its momentary operation. 
The results, then, are the folowing: 
 Contacts 516(1) being closed, terminals 290 and 310 (FIGS. 2C, 5 and 7) are energized, the former illuminating lamps 262 and 452 relating to a customers number. 
 Relay 474 is deenergzed by the conjoint actions of relays 482 and 484. 
 At 350 switch 136 rises to deenergize terminal 394 and energize terminal 396 (FIG. 2B), all of the connections of which are now open. 
 At 355 switch 134 recloses energizing the anode of the controlled rectifier S22, preparing it for firing in the next operation. 
 The entire system is now in the condition initially existing when the type of transaction was called for, except that relay 516 remains energized, calling for, and directing the location of entry of, the customers account number of illumination of the respective lamps 262 and 452. Operation of the printer will have advanced the sales slip to the next position for printing thereon. 
 Movement of the sales slip will open switch 432 preventing illumination of the lamp 446. The printing by the Clary printer will produce a heading line which, as indicated in FIG. 8, contains the date, the store number, the register number and the transaction number. Additionally the heading contains, with a code number, the type of transaction (in this case l) and the employees number. The type transaction number results from the depression of the key in the eleventh column; the employees number results from the depression of keys in the first to fth columns. The date is printed by a xed, but adjustable, printing head in the machine. The store number and the register number are printed by fixed slugs. The transaction number is printed by a numbering head which is advanced one unit for each transaction. These last mentioned matters are printed only once in a single transaction (in the heading line) under control of the employee solenoid 100. 
 Transmission of the information in the machine is as follows: 
 When the start transmission relay 474 is energized at 320, a signal is transmitted to the central unit indicating that the printer is ready for transmission. 
 Contacts 474(1) connect terminals 600 and 602. Contacts 474(4) connect positive to terminal 610. These last mentioned terminals lun to the central unit. 
 In response to signals given to the central unit it provides energization for relays 500 and 506 which are the access relays. Contacts 500( 1) connect the external terminal 596 to the complete relay 482 to provide energization thereof when a signal is delivered to terminal 596 from the central unit. Contacts 500(2), 50(1(3) and 500(4) connect the various reading terminals 366, 364 and 362 to terminals of a group `593 connected to the central unit. The remaining vertical columns in FIG. 6 are connected through other contacts of relay 500 to a group of terminals 592 which are connected to the central unit. Information is thus controlled for reading of the individual columns. The horizontal bars in FIG. 6 have connections of the group 384 and 386 connected individually to terminals of the group 594 which run to the central unit. 
 Closure of contacts 506(1) connects the external terminal 369 to the winding of the Wrong Number relay 512 and contacts 506(2) connect the external terminal 371 to the winding of the authorization relay 514. In a satisfactory transaction, these relays will not be energized, becoming energized only if numbers are unsatisfactory. 
 Contacts 506(3) connect a contact 595 running to the central unit through contacts 488(6), 494(6), 496(9), 504(7), 508(5), 510(6) and 516(6) running to the lines connecting terminals 384 to terminals 594. 
 Contacts 506(4) are in parallel with contacts 50(1) and have the same function. 
 It will be evident that the foregoing operations involve the following: 
 Transmission is initiated by a signal to the central unit, which in turn provides energization for scanning the setup of the printer to effect entry of the information in the central unit. When this operation is completed the central unit energizes the complete relay 482, to effect the operations already described. Following the transmission the depressed keys of the keyboard are released mechanically in the usual fashion. 
 The customers account number is now entered, one or more digits `being entered in the first to fifth columns. The results is depression of switches 146 and 147. Depression of switch 146 is not now material; but switch 147 now connects terminal 402 (energized as already described) to terminal 404. Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2C, it will be seen that 404 is connected through contacts 5l2(3), now closed contacts 516(2) and contacts 52(1(2) to terminal 412 which (FIG. 5) may be connected by closure of switch 413 to terminal 414. The latter (FIG. 2C) is connected through diode 552 to energize relay S10. Following entry of the customers account number the key 60 is depressed, closing the switch 413 and energizing the relay 510. 
 Contacts 510(3) now establish a holding circuit for relay 510 (from terminal 388) and simultaneously open the holding cricuit for relay 516, so that the former is effectively substituted for the latter in control function. Operations produced are so similar that they need not he described in detail and the following brief description will suffice: 
 Contacts 510(1) now serve to connect terminal 390 to terminals 292, 296 and 310 (as contrasted with 290 and 310). 
Contacts 510(2) have no immediate function. 
 Contacts 510(4) fire the controlled rectifier by connecting its gate to energized terminal 414. 
 Contacts 511](5) connect the cathode of the controlled rectified 522 to the energizing terminal 126 of the nonadd solenoid 120, and through diode 574 to terminal 113 of add solenoid 109. 
 Contacts 510(6) are involved in read-out, performing the functions previously performed by contacts 516(6). 
 Energization of the add solenoid 109 starts, as before, the cycle of the printer which is the same as that previously described, terminating with the relay 510 energized instead of relay 516. 
 Energized terminal 292 lights through terminal 294 the lamps 440, 442, 444 and 454, and through 502(l), now deenergized, and terminal 296 the lamp 266. Lamp 264 is also illuminated. Lamp 266 illuminates the program key 64 calling for entry of the unit control number, while lamp 264 illuminates the merchandise key 62. 
 The unit control number is now entered in the appropriate colunms and the result of this is depression of switches 144 and 145. The former effects no result at this time. Terminal 417 is connected through diode 544 to the unit control relay 502. 
 The switch 14S connects terminals 418 and 420 but no result occurs because the circuit from terminal 418 through 510(2) runs to the open contact 404. 
The operator must now depress the unit control key 64. 
 Depression of the unit control key closes the switch 410 which joins the terminals 415 and 417. The unit control key also closes the merchandise key switch 358 which connects terminals 356 and 360. (This last switch may also be closed by depression of the merchandise key alone.) 
 When switch 410 closes, positive terminal 402 is connected through switch 147 and through switch 410 to terminal 417, and unit control relay 502 is energized through diode 544. When relay 502 is energized a connection is provided from terminal 417 through 502,(), 494(4), 488(4), 486(4) and resistor 528 to the gate of the controlled rectifier 522 to cause firing. When relay 502 is enegrized, the opening of 502(4) deenergizes the relay 510. Relay 502 remains energized, current being delivered to its coil through contacts 486(1), 488(2), 494(2), 496(6), 498(4), 504(4) and 502(4). 
 Relay 502 remains energized, as does the controlled rectifier. 
 Operation of contacts 502,(1), 502(2), 502(3) and 502(4) produce no substantial results. Contacts 502(S) fired the controlled rectifier. Contacts 502(6) connect the cathode of the controlled rectifier through various connections to initiate a cycle of the printer. The unit control number is printed, the non-add solenoid controlling operation. 
 At the end of the unit control cycle of the printer, unit control relay 502 remains energized, and the merchandise program key 62 is illuminated by lamp 264, which receives current at terminal 292 through a series of relay contacts including contacts S02(l). The unit control key is not illuminated `because the circuit of lamp 266 is broken at contacts 502(1). 
 After the numerical merchandise entry is made, merchandise key 62 is depressed, closing switch 358. At this time, since the merchandise entry involves the depression of keys in the groups of columns 9-11, 7-8, 6 and 1-5, switches 143, 144, 145 and 147 will be in their lowered positions. Upon depression of the merchandise key, the item relay 504 will be energized, the energizing circuit being traceable through diode 540, terminal 416, switch 144, switch 143, terminal 360, merchandise switch 358, terminal 356, contacts 498(3) and 496(3), terminal 420, switch 145, terminal 418, contacts 496(2), 498(2), 502 (2), 512,(3), terminal 404, switch 147, terminal 402, contacts 484(1) and 482(1) to terminal 390. 
 When relay 504 is energized, the holding circuit for relay 502 is broken by the opening of contacts 504(4), and relay 502 becomes deenergized. Relay 504 is held through its contacts 504(4) and contacts 502(3), now closed. 
 Contacts 504(5) provide a tiring connection to the gate of the controlled rectifier. 
 rContacts 504(6) connect the controlled rectifier cathode through closed conections to energize various terminals including terminal 113 of the add solenoid 109. 
 The printer now goes through its cycle, and at the end of the cycle, relay S04 remains energized. Current is delivered through contacts 504(1), and various other contacts to terminals 292 and 296 to illuminate the merchandise and unit control keys respectively. Current is also delivered to terminals 298 and 302 to illuminate the subtotal and total lamps 268 and 274, respectively, the energizing circuit being traceable through contacts 504(3) (now closed), terminal 422, switches 143, 144, 145 and 147, terminal 402 and contacts 484(1) and 482( 1) to terminal 390. There is now the option of operating any one of the illuminated keys. 
 Assuming, in a typical operation, that another item is sold, the unit control number will be entered, and the unit control key depressed to initiate a unit control cycle identical with that previously described and ending with relay 502 energized. This calls for a merchandise entry, and again the merchandise key will be depressed to complete a second merchandise entry, there being illuminated after each merchandise entry the same indications: unit control, merchandise, subtotal andtotal. This sequence may be produced indefinitely. If a unit control number is not involved, a merchandise entry may be made without unit control operation, the merchandise key being depressed. After each merchandise operation, the same four keys are lit. 
 After all of the items of merchandise involved in the complete transaction are entered, it may be assumed that there is a tax involved for which the operator may want to know the amount. In order to have this amount appear, the subtotal key 66 is depressed. This closes switch 334, and connects terminals 298 (now energized) and 336 through line 333. Subtotal relay 498 is now energized through diode 534, and is held through its contacts 498 (4). Contacts 498(4) remove holding current from item relay 504. 
 Terminal 336 is connected to the gate of the controlled rectifier through contacts 498(5), and subtotal solenoid 102 is energized by the delivery of current to terminal 112 through contacts 498(6). This initiates another cycle of the machine. 
 Contacts 498(2) now connect terminals 418 and 404, and contacts 498(3) connect terminal 420 to terminal 342. The miscellaneous/tax key and the employee discount/deposit key are illuminated by lamps 270 and 272 respectively, which receive current at terminal 300 through contacts 498(1). Lamps 450 and 454 are illuminated from terminal 300. 
 Assuming that a tax is to be entered at this time, the appropriate key in column six will be depressed, for example, the state tax key. The amount of the tax is entered in columns 1-5. When the miscellaneous/tax key is depressed, switch 344 closes, connecting terminals 342 and 406. Switches and 147 are now in the downward position as a result of the depression of keys in columns 6 and 1-5. Miscellaneous relay 496 is now energized, its energizing circuit being traceable through diode 536, terminal 406, switch 344, terminal 342, contacts 498 (3), terminal 420, switch 145, terminal 418, contacts 496(2), and 498(2), contacts 512(3), terminal 404, switch 147 and terminal 402, which is now positive. 
 When relay 496 operates, contacts 496(1) maintain the energization of terminal 300 so that the miscellaneous/tax and employee discount/deposit keys remain lit. Contacts 496(2) maintain the connection between terminals 418 and 404, and contacts 496(3) maintain the connection between terminals 420 and 342. The total and subtotal lamps are lit through contacts 496(4) and terminals 302 and 298. Contacts 496(6) break the holding circuit for subtotal relay 498, and hold relay 496. Contacts 496(7) connect the relay energizing signal from terminal 406 to the gate of the controlled rectifier. Contacts 496(8) connect the cathode of the controlled rectifier to the junction of diodes 564 and 566 so that terminals 210, 214, 222, 226, 234 and 238 are energized. The energization of these terminals activates the individual switches associated with the out of state, repair, alteration, handling charge, state tax and Federal tax keys in column 6. If either the Federal tax key or the state tax key has been depressed terminal 114 of tax solenoid 103 will be energized through one of terminals 236 and 240. In the tax operation, the tax solenoid operates primarily to give the symbol. The tax solenoid operates through a linkage to produce adding, the add solenoid not being energized. 
 On the other hand, if any one of the keys including the out of state key, the repair key, the alteration key and the handling charge key, has been depressed, terminal 113 of the add solenoid 109 will be energized through one of terminals 212, 216, 224 and 228. ln either of the above operations the amount will be added in the accumulator. 
 Lamp 270, associated with the miscellaneous/tax key remains illuminated so that it is possible to introduce any of the miscellaneous items in column 6 and the cycles may
