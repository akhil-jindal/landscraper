Gehring, In, and Marvin Jacoby, Fort Washington, and Trevor Drake Reader, Wayne, Pa., assignors to Sperry Rand Corporation, New York, N.Y., a corporation of Delaware Eiied June 19, 1963, Ser.

 FIGURE 14 shows in partial schematic and in partial diagrammatic form one suitable information output device employed by this invention. 
 Reference is now made to FIGURE 1. As shown in this figure, the computer comprises a memorysection 10 whichfor the purposes of simplification is hereinafter assumed to have a capacity of four words. The Memory 10 is used :to store .both instruction words and data words which again for purposes of simplification are hereinafter assumed to comprise four binary bits each. Accordingly, the word format will appear to be composed of four binary bits designated from left to right as M4, M3, M2, M1; where M4 is the most significant bit, M3 the second most significant bit; M2 the next to least significant bit, and M1 the least significant bit. In FIGURE 1, the four bits of a stored word are shown for drawing ease arranged vertically and the memory is shown divided into four vertical columns of four rows each. Each vertical column represents a different word of storage and each row represents the corresponding bit positions of each word. For example, the top row represents the M4 bit of each word stored in the memory, the second row the M3 bit and so on. 
 The four binary bits 'of .a data word can be used to represent decimal values ranging from zero (0000) to 15 (1111). In the instruction word, the two least significant bits M2 and M1 represent a memory address used in an instruction; and the two most significant bits M4 and M3 identify the operation to be performed by the instruction. Thus, in the present example, the two least significant bits M2 .and M1 are used to represent any one of the four addresses in the memory; while the two instruction bits M4 and M3 are used to represent any one of four instructions. 
 A typical four instruction repertoire for the illustrated computer is set forth by the table below: 
TAB LE Code Ad- Definition dress Symbol Transfer 1 Jump"... 1 
 In the above table, the abbreviated designation (A)+(M) A, signifies that the word stored in the Memory Address designated by M is to be added to the contents of the A Register (also designated the Arithmetic Register) and the result is to be stored in the A Register. The abbreviated designation (A)- M signifies that the contents of the A Register is to be stored in the Memory Address designated by M. Finally, the shorthand designation, (M+1)- if A%O otherwise C+-1+C, signifies that the neat instruction will be found in the Memory at the address designated (M-l-l) if the contents of the A Register is not zero, but if the contents of the A Register is zero then the next instruction will be found in the Memory at the address immediately following the address of the present instruction. 
 The significance and the manner in which these instructions are carried out will be dealt with in detail hereinafter. Before proceeding further with the description of FIGURE 1, however, it should be expressly understood that the memory capacity and instruction repertoire has been'purposely limited in order to facilitate the description of the novel concepts embraced by the present invent-ion. It should be equally well understood, that by increasing the size of the computer word from its present 4 bit minimum, both the word capacity of the Memory and the range of instructions performed by the computer can be increased by any desired amount. For example, the number of instructions which can be performed by the computer corresponds to the function 2 where N corresponds to the number of binary bits in the instruction word used to represent the operation to be performed by instruction. Likewise, the number of memory locations in the memory also corresponds to the function 2 where N corresponds to the number of bits in the instruction word used to represent memory addresses. Thus if the word size is increased by two bits, one bit in the instruction portion of a word and one bit in the address portion of a word; then an instruction repertoire of 8 instructions and a memory capacity of 8 words would be possible. 
 Continuing now with the description of FIGURE 1, the reference character 11 represents a four bit binary Arithmetic Register which is so connected to the Memory as to receive information from the Memory or to transmit information thereto as called for by the operation of the computer. The Arithmetic Register, or A Register as it is called, corresponds to the main arithmetic element of the computer. It has the property of adding an operand received from the Memory to the contents previously stored in the A Register and of storing the result of such addition. The A Register also includes a keyboard input represented by the letters K for manually inserting data therein by an operator. 
 Reference character v12, labeled Memory Select corresponds to the memory addressing element of the computer. This element functions to select an address location in the Memory 10 into which a computer word may be stored or from which a computer word may be read. This element is driven from a Control Counter 13 or a Static Register 14. The Control Counter 13 is, in this .embodiment where a four word memory is assumed a scale-of-four counter which is advanced automatically one count at the completion of each instruction. In other words the Control Counter 13 normally functions to address the memory for the next instruction to be performed. Control Counter 13 is therefore the device which normally sequences the computer through its instruction routine. The Static Register 14 is, in the present example, a two bit storage register for storing the M2 and M1 bits of an instruction word. This device is used to provide the address selection information used by an instruction word. This register like the A Register has a keyboard input represented by the letters K by which an operator may manually load address information directly into this regis ter whenever desired. 
 Block 15, labeled Instruction Decode, also includes in the present example, a two bit storage register in which the function digits M4 and M3 of an instruction word may be stored. The two function bits stored in the decode Register 15 are decoded to provide a signal on one of four instruction lines 21); one line for each of the four instructions comprising the repertoire of the computer. I 
The Decode Register 15 also has a keyboard input labeled K by which an operator may manually load into this element any of the four instructions of the computer. 
 The four lines of output from the instruction Decode 15 are fed to a Function Select element 16 which to gether with a Step Counter 17 controls the normal sequence of operations of the various computer components during the performance of instructions. Again in the present example the Step Counter 17 is a scale-offour counter which is normally stepped periodically through its four states during the execution of an instruction. 
 The final two components shown in FIGURE 1 are the Clock Generator 19 and the Manual Control block 18. This latter component provides the equipment necessary to starting the computer and to controlling its mode of operation. To this end component 18 includes two mode keys 21 and 22 and a start key 23. The mode key 21 operates as a one instruction key while key 22 operates as a continuous mode key. Actuation of the one instruction key 21 will upon actuation of the start key 23 cause the computer to perform one instruction and then halt. Actuation of the continuous key 22 will upon further actuation of the start key 23 cause the computer to operate continuously progressing from one instruction to the next. 
 The Clock 1 is a pulse generator which provides periodic short duration pressure pulses on a plurality of output lines. Typically, these clock pulses will have a duration of 20 milliseconds and a repetition rate of 4 cycles per seccond. Some of the output lines from the clock are normally in a high pressure state and drop to a low pressure condition during the clock time. These lines are labeled TP; the minus sign indicating that the pressure drops low during the clock pulses. Conversely, others of the output lines from the clock are normally at a low pressure level except during clock pulse time when the pressure rises to a high state. These lines are labeled TP+; the plus sign indicating that the pressure rises to a high level during the clock time. 
 Before proceeding with the more detailed description of the construction of the computer and its various components, the basic operating cycle of the computer will briefly be described by reference to FIGURE 2. As shown in FIGURE 2, the machine cycle, that is, the interval required to perform an instruction, is made up of the four steps of the Step Counter 17. Step Counter 17 is stepped through its four states one step at a time by the successive pulses from the Clock Generator '19. The pulses from the clock which step the Step Counter are shown in Waveform A of this figure. As indicated immediately above Waveform A, the Step Counter 17 is cyclically advanced according to the Gray code through its four states, 11, 10, ()0, 01, 11, etc. The Gray code is used for ease in construction of the counter itself. The machine cycle is also indicated above Waveform A as comprising all four states of the step counter. 
 As shown in Waveform B, FIGURE 2, the Function Select re in conjunction with the Step Counter 17 generates a cyclical clearing signal which clears the Static Register 14 and Instruction Decode 15 during the 11 state of the Counter 17. In other words, the clearing signal clears the components 14 and 15 in preparation for the receipt of the next instruction from the Memory. At the end of the 11 state of the Step Counter, the Function Select 16 generates an advance signal for the Control Counter 13 as shown by Waveform C. The function of Waveform C is therefore to increase the count in the Control Counter 13 by one in preparation for obtaining from the Memory the next instruction to be executed. The Step Counter 17 is then stepped to its 10 state. During this period the Function Select 16 in conjunction with the Step Counter 17 generates the Waveform D which operates to gate the Control Counter 13 reading into the Memory Select 12 which in turn reads the next inst-ruction out of the Memory 10 onto the M4 to M1 output lines of the Memory. At the end of this period, the Function Select 16 generates a gating signal as shown in Waveform E which gates the instruction now being read out on the memory output lines into the Instruction Decode component 15 and the Static Register 14. At the end of this period the Step Counter 17 is stepped to its 00 state which is the first step of an instruction execution period. The instruction execution period covers the O0 and ()1 steps of the step counter. Following the 01 step, the Step Counter 17 is advanced to its 11 state during which time the action indicated by Waveforms B and C takes place in preparation for the execution of the next computer instruction. 
Typical fluid devices Having briefly described the major components comprising the System, a short description of the typical fluid devices utilized by the present invent-ion will now be given. 
Referring first to FIGURE 4 there is shown in simplified diagrammatic form a pure fluid flip-flop device typical of the type of flip-flop used in the present invention. Also shown in this figure is the schematic symbol for such a flip-flop. 
As shown in FIGURE 4, the flip-flop is of the type previously described in the literature and in various issued patents such as US. Patents 3,001,698 and 3,016,066 to R. W. Warren. It includes a high power input duct 320 which is connected through an interaction chamber 321 to a pair of output ducts 324 and 325'. Fluid, such as air or water, is continuously applied under high pressure to the input duct 320. The input duct terminates in a nozzle 325 which converts the high pressure fluid into a high velocity fluid jet which passes through the interaction chamber 321 into one of the output ducts 324 or 325. in more particular, the flip-flop is designed as indicated by the above patents to utilize the boundary layer lock-on effect whereby the high velocity jet issuing from the power nozzle 326 attaches itself to one of the output duct side walls 327 or 328 and remains attached to this side wall until dislodged by a control jet applied from one of the transverse control nozzles 329 and 329a connected to the input ducts 322 and 323. 
 As indicated by the dotted line 33%) and as described by the above patents, the flip-flop as well as the other fluid elements yet to be described may be made as a laminated structure comprising a top plate, a bottom plate and an intermediate plate. The intermediate plate is tightly secured (glued or clamped) between the top and bottom plates and is channeled or cut to form the various side walls of the flip-flop therein. 
 The operation of the flip-flop shown in FIGURE 4 as a bi-stable element will now be described. Fluid under high pressure is continuously applied, as will be described, to the power input duct 326;. In the present case, air is preferred as the fluid. The power nozzle 326 converts the high pressure fluid into a high velocity jet and directs this jet into the interaction chamber 321. Because of the design of the interaction chamber 3-21 the boundary layer lock-on effect causes the jet to lock onto one of the side walls 327 or 32$ whereby fluid will flow out of the corresponding output duct 324- or 325. The output ducts 324 and 325 may, in turn, be coupled to a pair of output lines (flexible hoses for example) through a pair of coupling elements 331 and 332. Each of the coupling elements may typically include a pair of bleed openings 3311a and 3320 which are adjusted to control the back loading on the flip-flop and thereby insure stable operation. Porous plugs could be used if desired as described in Patent 3,001,698. 
 If the power jet is attached to Wall 325% and is therefore flowing out output duct 325, the pressure at the output coupling 331 is high and the flip-flop is said to be set to its binary state as indicated by the associated schematic symbol. The flip-flop will stay in this condition until a high pressure fluid signal is applied to the binary 1 control input duct 323. A high pressure control signal thus applied causes the control nozzle 329 to emit a control jet into the interaction chamber 321 which will impinge upon the power jet and thereby deflect it away from wall 32% onto wall 327. Once the power jet has been dislodged from wall 328 by an input control signal applied to duct 32 3 the power jet will attach itself to the opposite wall 327 and cause fluid to now flow out the output duct 32 i. Fluid flowing out this output duct causes the output pressure at the output coupling 332 to rise to a high level whereby the flip-flop is said to be set to its binary 1 state. Now to switch the flip-flop back to its binary 0" state, a high pressure control signal will have to be applied to the binary 0 input duct 322. 
 Each of the input control ducts 322 and 32 3 may include an associated orifice 322a and 323a. These orifices are added to render the control jets less sensitive to pressure changes in the input ducts and to thereby improve 6 the switching stability of the flipfiops. Again these orifices could be replaced, if desired, by porous plugs. 
 In a typical embodiment, the Control Nozzles 32? and 32% and the power nozzle were each made 20 mils wide by 120 mils deep; the control orifices were 39 mils in diameter and the power jets were derived from a source of air pressure operating at 20 inches of water pressure above atmospheric pressure. 
 The flip-flop is also used as the basic memory cell for storing the binary bits of a memory word. When so used, the orifices 322a and 323m in the input control ducts 322 and 323 may be reduced in size to about 20 mils in diameter so that normal control pressures applied to the control ducts 322 and 323 during the time that the power jet is flowing will be ineffective to switch the power jet. Switching of the power jet in the memory from one output duct to the other is accomplished by momentarily interrupting the power jet issuing from nozzle 326. When the power jet is so interrupted, the feeble control jets issuing from the control nozzles 329 or 32% will be eflective to cause the power jet, when it is reestablished, to issue from the appropriate output duct 3124 or 3 25. 
 FIGURE 5 shows in diagrammatic form a typical fluid flow divider used by the present invention. As indicated in the figure, the flow divider may be a laminated structure similar to the flip-flop, but wherein the center lamination includes a symmetrically formed Y shaped duct cut therein. This element is operative so .that a pressure level applied to any one leg of the Y shaped duct such as A will produce similar or equal pressures at the output (A' and A) of the other two legs. The schematic symbol for this element is as shown. 
 FIGURE 6 shows in diagrammatic form a passive OR gate. It also is typically a laminated structure the center lamination of which is cut to provide a pair of converging input ducts 333 and 334 which converge to a common throat area 336 and then into a common, tapered, output duct 335. A pair of fan shaped release ports may branch off the throat area as shown. The operation of this element is such that a high pressure input A or B applied to either input duct 333 or 334 or both will yield the logical sum on the output duct as indicated by the expression A+B in the drawing. 
 FIGURE 7 shows in diagrammatic form a fluid passive AND gate and its schematic symbol. This element is also made as a laminated structure in which the center laminate is cut to provide the duct work diagrammatically indicated in the figure. In more particular, this element comprises a pair of input ducts 337 and 338 and a common output duct 341. Each of the input ducts terminates in a nozzle 337a and 338a and are disposed at an angle of approximately relative to one another. The output duct 341 is located opposite the input nozzles along a line which bisects the angle between the input ducts as indicated in the figure. Finally, a pair of fan shaped release ports 33 and 340 are located opposite each of the input nozzles 337a and 338a. 
 In operation, a high pressure input A or B to either of the input ducts 337 or 338 alone will produce a high velocity jet from the appropriate nozzle 337a or 338a which in turn will pass directly out the opposite release port 339 or 340 without materially effecting the output pressure in the output duct 341. Conversely, when substantially equal high pressure inputs are simultaneously present on the input ducts 337 and 338, the resulting jets issuing from nozzles 337a and 333a combine and flow out the output duct 341 thereby raising the output pressure in the output duct. This device therefore performs the logical product operation A.B as indicated by the associated schematic symbol. 
 FIGURE 8 shown in diagrammatic form is a typical fluid delay element used by this invention together with the schematic symbol therefor. As shown, the fluid delay is simply a volumetric tank 344 or the like having an input pipe 342 and an output pipe 343 associated therewith. The operation of this element is as followsf a step change in the input pressure on the input line 342 will appear as a similar change in the output pressure on output line 343 after a delay D. The amount of the delay D is a function of the volume of the tank 344. 
 The delay tank 344 could be made as a laminated structure in a manner similar to that used in fabricating the other devices or it could, if desired, be a simple length of line. 
 A multi-purpose component which will operate as an amplifier, an inverter, an amplifying OR gate or as an amplifying NOR gate is shown in diagrammatic form in FIGURE 9 together with its schematic symbol. Referring now to FIGURE 9, it will be seen that this component comprises a flip-flop component 345 to one input 347 of which is coupled a passive OR device 346. The flip-flop 345 is made unistable by unbalancing the output loads such as for example by inserting an output orifice 34312 in the output 349 so that the power jet will normally exit from the output 348. 
 As thus constructed, the power jet will normally flow out output 348 and will only flow out output 349 during the time a high pressure control signal is applied to the input duct 347. The component therefore, is said to have an inverting output 348 and a non-inverting output 349. 
 The operation of this component is as follows: a high pressure input signal applied to either input A or B or both of the passive OR gate 346 deflects the power jet to output 349. Output 349 therefore yields the logical sum A+B, as indicated in the schematic symbol. Conversely, in the absence of a high pressure signal at both input A and B the power jet will flow out output 348. Output 348 will therefore yield the logical NOR function XE also as indicated in the schematic symbol. 
 The OR function is therefore derived from the noninverting output 349 and the NOR function from the inverting output 348. The passive OR device 346 is used to adopt the component to two inputs. If a single input is to be used, then the OR element 346 can be removed and the single input can be applied directly to input duct 347. 
 FIGURE 11 shows in diagrammatic form a typical fluid power supply for the computer system of this invention. As indicated, the power supply may comprise a constant high pressure source such as an air compressor 350 which is coupled to a plurality of pressure tanks 351. Each of the tanks in turn comprises a plurality of output nipples or pipes 352 which are in turn coupled by means, not shown, to the input power ducts of the various fluid elements comprising the invention. In a typical example, a pump capable of developing 20 lbs. of pressure was used. The output nipples 352 on tanks 351 were coupled to the power ducts of the various fluid elements through flexible hoses. 
 The final element to be considered before a detailed description is given of the system is the key set element shown in FIGURE 10 which is used in the A Register 11, the Manual Control 18 and elsewhere to set the flip-flops in these components. As diagrammatically shown in FIGURE 10, this device simply comprises an input supply line 356 which could be connected at one end to a nipple 352 of a pressure tank 351; an output line 355 which could be connected to an input control duct of the associated flip-flop; and a power divider 353 connecting the lines 355 and 356. The other leg of the divider 353 is connected to an open port 354a formed in a finger key 354. The connections between the input 356 and output 355 lines and the divider 353 preferably includes an orifice 356:; connected in the pressure line 356. 
 In operation, high pressure is continuously supplied to input line 356. The orifice 35 a together with the normally open port 354a in key 354 permit the pressure in the region downstream from the orifice 356a to drop to atmospheric or zero whereby the pressure on the output line 355 is low. When, however, the operator fingers the key 354 thereby closing the port 354a, the pressure downstream from the orifice 356a rises producing a high pressure on output line 355 to thus trigger the associated flip-flop. 
 In the above figures the passive OR gate, the AND gate, the flip-flops, etc. have all been shown as separate laminated elements and it has been suggested that the connection between these elements may be made via flexible hoses. It should be understood, however, that in a refined embodiment a plurality of elements may be supported and'interconnected by a single large laminated structure. In this case, the interconnection could be made by forming appropriate channels directly in the center laminate of the large laminated structure. 
 Also in the illustrations to follow, an element such as a flip-flop or an amplifying OR/NOR gate will sometimes be schematically shown as using only one of the outputs therefrom. It will, of course be understood that in these cases the unused output simply exhausts into the atmosphere. 
Clock Reference is now made to FIGURES 12a through 12 Where a schematic diagram of a computer embodying the teachings of the present invention is disclosed. These figures should be arranged according to the showing in FIGURE 12 in order to visualize the interconnections of the various components comprising this invention. To clarify the showing in these figures, the interconnections are labelled where appropriate and are equipped with arrowheads to indicate the direction of signal flow. The illustration shown in these figures, utilizes the previously explained symbols to represent the elements used in the construction of the computer. Dotted lines are used to surround the appropriate portions of FIGURES 12a through 12 to show the correspondence between the components of FIGURE 1 and the components shown in more detail in these figures. 
 Before describing the operation of the system shown in FIGURES 12a through 12 a detailed description of each of the components, such as the Clock 19, the Instruction Decode 16, etc. will be given. 
 Turning now in particular to FIGURE 12a, the first such component to be described will be the Clock 19. As shown, the clock comprises the flip-flop element which has its lower output, as viewed in the figure, fed back through a delay element 131 to its lower control nozzle 1132. Similarly, the upper output, as viewed in the figure, is fed through a delay element 103 to its upper control nozzle 104. With this interconnection, the'normal stable operation of the flip-flop is converted into that of a free running oscillator whose period is a function of the value of the combined delay of the two delay elements 101 and 103. In a typical embodiment the delay elements 161 and 103 could be equal, in which case the output from the flip-flop would be a symmetrical waveform such as shown in FIGURE 3. In FIGURE 3, the waveform A represents the output from the lower output duct or flip-flop 1% while waveform B represents the output from the upper output duct. As indicated in the waveform A, the output pressure from the lower output duct is high for a period equal to the delay D of element 1191 and then low for a period equal to the delay D of element 1G3. The output from the upper output duct as indicated by waveform B is the inverse of that from the lower output duct. 
 The two outputs from the flip-fiop 104) are coupled respectively to the two inputs of an amplifying OR/NOR gate 105. The upper output duct of flip-flop 1% is coupled directly to one of the inputs of gate 1135 while the lower output duct of flip-lop 143i is coupled through a small delay element 106 to the other input of gate 105. The action of the small delay element 106 is to delay one .gate 123. 
input to the gate 105 by an amount equal to the desired duration of the clock pulse. The delayed input to gate 105 is thus shown as waveform C of FIGURE 3. The application of pressures on the inputs to gate 105 having the timing and pressure characteristics of waveforms B and C, FIGURE 3, will thus produce at the non-inverting output 107 from gate 105 a pressure signal such as shown in waveform D of FIGURE 3. As herein indicated, the output from line 107 is normally high except that it drops to a low pressure for a period d equal to the delay of delay element 106 at a repetition period equal to 2D wherein 2]) equals the combined delay of delay elements 101 and 103. Thus the output from line 107 is designated TP-A; where the TP indicates a low pressure level at clock time and the A simply identifies the particular output line 107. The other output of gate 105 appearing on line 108 as shown in waveform E of FIGURE 3 is simply the inverse of waveform D. 
 The output on line 108 from gate 105 is used to generate other clock pulses both positive (TP+) and negative (TP) as will now be described. To this end the output on line 108 is applied to a pair of inverters 109 and 110. The first inverter produces in response to the output 108 from gate 105 a positive clock pulse labelled TP+A on its non-inverting output line 111 and negative clock pulse labelled TPC on its inverting output line 112. Similarly the second inverter 110 produces a positive clock pulse labelled TP+C on its non-inverting output 113 and and a negative clock pulse labelled T P-D on its inverting output 114. Finally the non-inverting output from the second inverter 110 is fed to the input of third inverter 115 to produce a positive clock pulse TP+B on its noninverting output 116 and a negative clock pulse labelled TP-B on its inverting output 117. 
 All of the positive and negative clock pulses are synchronous as shown by waveforms D and E of FIGURE 3 and could have been taken directly from the noninverting and inverting outputs 167 and 108 respectively of gate 105. In such a case a high powered flip-flop 10% and gate 105 would be used and the inverters 109, 110 and 115 eliminated. With the present construction, however, low power elements such as is found throughout the computer can he used. The advantage of the present construction which uses a plurality of inverters to produce all the clock pulses is that standardized, low power elements can be employed throughout the computer. 
Step Counter 17 The next component to he described will be the Step Counter 17 which is also shown in schematic detail in FIGURE 12a. This component, as previously indicated comprises a pair or" flip-flops 118 and 119 interconnected so as to form a scale-of-four counter. Also as previously indicated the interconnection between the iiip-fiops is made so that the counter counts according to the Gray Code. In more particular, the output from the first stage flip-flop 118 of the counter is coupled through line 120, delay element 121, AND gate 123 to the 0 input nozzle of the second stage flip-flop 119. The 0 output of flip-flop 118 is also coupled through the inverting output of inverter 124, line 125, delay element 126, AND gate 127 to the 1 input nozzle of the flip-flop 119. The other input to the AND gates 123 and 127 is taken from the clock line 111 on which a positive clock pulse (Tlperiodically appears. With the recited connection and with the first tlipdiop 118 in its 0 state, a high pressure will appear on line 20 to condition AND Then at clock time a positive clock pulse TP+ will pass through gate 123 to set the second stage flip-flop 119 to its 0 state. Conversely, when the first stage flip-flop 118 is in its 1 state a high pressure output will appear on line 125 from the inverter 124. This will condition AND gate 127. Then at clock time a positive clock pulse TP+ will pass through gate 127 to 10 the 1 input of flip-flop 119 to set flip-fiop 119 to its 1 state. 
 The 0 output of the second stage flip-flop 119 is coupled through line 128, delay element 129, a control gate 130, an input AND gate 131 to the 1 input nozzle of the first stage flip-flop 118. The 0 output from flip-flop 119 is also fed through the inverting output of an inverter 132, line 133, delay element 134, AND gate 135 to the 0 input nozzle of flip-flop 118. The other inputs to gates 131 and 135 is taken from the clock line 116 on which a positive clock pulse (TP+) periodically appears. 
 The function of the control gate 130, as will be described, is to provide a control point for controlling the starting or stopping of the counter from a control line 136. For the time being assume that the pressure on control line 136 is high and that the gate is active. 
 With the described connection between the output of flip-flop 119 and the input to flip-flop 118, it will be seen that when the flip-flop 119 is in the 0 state, the positive pressure appearing on line 128 will pass through the control gate 130 to condition gate 131. Then at clock time, the TP+ signal on line 116 will pass gate 131 to set flipflop 118 to its 1 state. Conversely, when flip-flop 119 is in its 1 state, the high pressure output from the inverter 132 will appear on line 133 to condition gate 135. Then at clock time, the positive clock pulse appearing on line 116 will pass gate 135 to set flip-flop 118 to its 0 state. 
 The switching sequence of the flip-flops 118 and 119 follows the pattern indicated below, where the right-hand bit represents the state of flip-flop 118 and the left-hand bit represents the state of flip-flop 119: 
 From the above pattern it will be seen that only one flip-flop stage at a time changes state. The switching criterion is that flip-flop 119 will be switched to the former state of flip-flop 118 and flip-flop 118 will be switched to the state opposite that formerly held by flip-flop 119 in response to each clock pulse. 
 Before describing a cycle of operation of the counter, it should be noted that the delay elements 121, 126, 129 and 134 are added to the circuit to prevent double switching of the flip-flops. The delays provided by these elements are generally all equal to one another and are slightly longer than the duration of a clock pulse. 
 Assuming a starting state of 00 for the flip-flops 118 and 119 and a sustained high pressure level on the control line 136 so that gate 130 is active, the operation of the counter is as follows: 
 The 0 state of flip-flop 118 conditions gate 123 and the 0 state of flip-flop 119 conditions gate 131 through gate 130. At clock time a positive clock pulse passes through both gates 123 and 131. The clock pulse passing gate 123 has no effect on the state of flip-flop 119 since this pulse would normally try to switch flip-flop 119 to its 0 state and flip-flop 119 is already in the 0 state. The positive clock pulse passing through gate 131 however is efiective and operates to switch flip-flop 118 to its 1 state. Thus at the end of the first clock pulse the state of the counter changes from 00 to 01. The 0 state of flip-flop 119 continues to condition gate 131, while the 1 state of flip-flop 118 new conditions gate 127 rather than gate 123. It will be noted, however, that due to the delay 126 gate 127 wont be conditioned until some time after the first clock pulse has terminated. At the second clock pulse time, the clock pulse passing through gate 131 is inefiective to switch flip-flop 118, since flip-flop 118 is already in its 1 state. The clock pulse passing through gate 127, however, is effective to switch flip-flop 119 to its "1 state whereby the counter will now 1 1 be set to its 11 state. The 11 state of the counter will condition gates 127 and 135 so that upon receipt of the third clock pulse the counter will change to its state. The 10 state conditions gates 123 and 135 so that upon the receipt of the fourth clock pulse the counter will switch back to its 00 state thereby completing the cycle of operation. 
Manual Control 18 The component used for starting and for controlling the mode of operation assumed by the computer, namely the Manual Control 18, will now be described again by reference to FIGURE 12a. This component operates when the computer is to be placed in the continuous mode to apply a continuous high pressure on the control line 136 to thereby continuously condition gate 135 in the Step Counter 17 whereby the Step Counter 17 may be cycled continuously. In the alternative, when the computer is to be placed in the one instruction mode, the Manual Control operates to apply high pressure on the line 136 for one cycle of operation of the Step Counter. At the end of a cycle of operation, the pressure on line 136 will drop to its low level to disable gate 131 and to prevent further cycling of the Step Counter until the start key is actuated. 
 Included in the Manual Control 18 is a control flip-flop 137 the 0 output of which is coupled a delay element 139 to the control line 136 so that Whenever flip-flop 137 is set to its 0 state the control gate 131? will be conditioned and the Step Counter 17 will step through its cycle of operation. 
 The control flip-flop 137 is set to its 0 state by a start circuit which includes an AND gate 140 the output of which couples to the 0 control nozzle of the flip-flop 137. One input to the AND gate 1 1% is taken from the positive clock pulse line 113 (T P-l-C and the other input is taken from the output of a second AND gate 14-8. One input to gate 148 is derived from one output of a divider 152, while the other input to gate 148 is derived from the inverting output of an inverter 149. The input to the inverter 149 is derived from the output of a delay element 151 the input to which is obtained from the second output of divider 152. The input to the divider in turn is derived from a high pressure supply line 151 to which is coupled the start key 23. 
 The start key 23 provides a pressure escape port for line 151 so that the input pressure to the divider 152 is normally at a low level. When the operator manually activates key 23, the input pressure to the divider 152 rises to its high level state. This actuates gate 1% since the direct input to gate 143 from the divider 152 rises to its high level state and the second input. to gate 145 from inverter 149 is normally high. After a period equal to the delay provided by the delay element 151) the high pressure output from the inverting output of inverter 149 ceases and therefore the output from gate 145 ceases. Thus the delay element the inverter 149, the gate 148 and the divider 152 acts as a single pulser circuit which delivers to gate 14% a single positive pressure pulse equal in duration to the delay provided by element 1543 upon actuation of the start key 23. This pulse although short in comparison to the time interval an operator would keep his finger on key 23 must be at least slightly greater than the interval between successive clock pulses and somewhat shorter than the interval spanned by four clock pulses. 
At clock pulse time during the existence of an output pulse from gate 148 a TP+ clock pulse appearing on line 113 gates through gate 149 to switch the control flip-flop 137 to its 0 state. 
 Since the step counter is advanced by positive clock pulses and the control flip-flop 137 is set to its 0 state by positive clock pulses, some provision must be made to avoid conditioning gate 13th in the middle of a clock pulse. If this occurred the initial advancing of the step counter may be unreliable. Therefore to avoid this problem the 0 output from flip-flop 137 is fed through a small delay 139 to the gate 130. This delay is preferably just slightly longer than the duration of a clock pulse but shorter than the period between successive clock pulses. 
 The control flip-flop 137 is set to its 1 state and the operation of the Step Counter 17 interrupted by the resultant removal of high pressure from the control line 136 Whenever the one instruction key 21 is actuated or Whenever a programmed halt instruction is executed. To this end the 1 input nozzle of flip-flop 137 is coupled to the output line of an AND gate 141. One input to the AND gate 141 is taken from line 142 (also identified as the (2F) line) of the Function Select 16 which line develops a high pressure during each 61 state of the Step Counter 17. The other input to gate 14-1 is taken from the output of an OR gate one input to which is derived from the Halt Line 144 in the Instruction Decode 15. As will be described the Halt Line 144 (also identified as the H line) in the Instruction Decode 15 goes to a high pressure whenever a halt or H instruction is to be performed. Thus during an H instruction, as will be described, line 144 in the Instruction Decode 15 goes high to thereby produce a high pressure output from OR gate 143. The high pressure output from gate 143 conditions gate 141, which in turn produces an output to set flip-flop 137 to its 1 state when the Step Counter 17 reaches its 01 count and the pressure on line 142 goes high. Although the control flip-flop 137 will beset to its 1 state when the Step Counter 17 reaches its 01 state, the control flip-flop 137 is ineffective to stop the Step Counter 17 until the latter reaches its 00 state. This delayed control over the Step Counter 17 will be apparent from an inspection of the input gating of the Step Counter itself. More specifically, it will be seen that gate 133 and therefore gate 131 in the Step Counter does not come into play in the normal step counter cycle until the step counter reaches its (it) state. 
 Returning to the OR gate 143, it will be seen that the other input to this gate is derived from the 1 output of the mode control flip-flop 145. Flip-flop 145 is set to its 1 output condition by the manual actuation of the one instruction key 21 which is coupled to a high pressure line 147 leading to the 1 input nozzle of flip-flop 145. 
Actuation of key 21 sets the flip-flop 145 to its 1 state. The high pressure output on the 1 output line of flip-flop 145 produces a high pressure output from the OR gate 143 which in turn conditions gate 141. When the Step Counter 17 reaches its 01 state, the high pressure output eveloped on line 142 of the function select at this time produces an output from gate 141 to set the control flipflop137 to its 1 state and to thereby stop the advancing of the Step Counter 17 when the latter reaches its 00 state. 
 The mode control flip-flop 145 is set to its 0 state by manual actuation of the continuous key 22. Key 22 is coupled to a high pressure line 146 which leads to the 0 input nozzle of the mode flip-flop 14-5. Thus, actuation of key 22 sets rip-flop 145 to its 0 state to thereby remove the output from OR gate 143 and to thereby remove the conditioning signal from gate 141. 
Instruction Decoder 15 The next component in the overall complex of the computer to be described will be the Instruction Decode 15 which is shown in detail in FIGURE 12b. 
 The Instruction Decode 15 operates to store the instruction bits (M4 and M3 in this case) of an instruction word and to generate a predetermined pressure level on a unique one of a group of control lines for each instruction. Turning now to FIGURE 12.), it will be seen that the Instruction Decode 15 comprises a pair of storage flip-flops 153 and 154. Flip-flop 153 is used to store the M4- bit of an instruction word and flip-flop 154 is used to store the M3 bit of the instruction word. The M4 and M3 bits of an instruction word are derived (as will be described) from the output complement lines m and m of the Memory L10 and are fed through a pair of AND gates 155 and 156 and then a pair of OR gates 157 and 158 to the control nozzle of the flip-flops 153 and 154. The AND gates 155 and 156 are conditioned from the (4B) function line 159 of the Function Select 16 as will later be described. The (4B) line develops as shown by Waveform E, FIGURE 2, a high pressure level at clock time during the 10 step of the Step Counter 17. At this instant the instruction bits appearing on the H 1 and INT? output complement lines of the memory are gated through gates 155 and 156 and thence through OR gates 157 and 158 to set the states of flip-flops 153 and 154 according to the instruction code of the instruction next to be performed. 
 Before the instruction bits are loaded into the flip-flops 153 and 154, these flip-flops are cleared to a reference condition. This is done as shown by Waveform B, FIG- URE 2, during the 11 step of the Step Counter 17 During the 11 step of the Step Counter, the Function Select 16 generates, as will be described, a high pressure level on its (3C) function line 160. This high pressure signal on line 1161 is fed through a pair of OR gates 161 and 162 to the 1 input control nozzles of the flip-flops 153 and 154 to set both of these flip-flops to their 1 state. 
 The l and 0 outputs from the flip-flops 153 and 154 are gated together in a gating matrix shown generally at 163 to selectively produce at the outputs of a plurality of control lines, indicated in general in FIG- URE 1 at 21) and in the present figure as lines 144 and 164 through 167, a predetermined pressure level which is used by the computer to control its operation. In more particular, the 1 output from each of the flip-flops 153 and 154 is connected to the respective inputs of an inverter 168, the inverting output from which serves as the Halt (H) Control line 144 for the computer. In operation, when both flip-flops 153 and 154 have been set to their 00 state (M4 M3=00) which is the code for a Halt instruction, both inputs to the inverter 163 will be low whereby, the pressure on line 144 will be high. This high pressure on line 144, as previously described, passes through the OR gate 143 in the Manual Control 18 to condition gate 141. Then when the (2F) signal line 142 from the Function Select 16 develops a high pressure during the ()1 step of the Step Counter 17, the control flipi'lop 137 in the Manual Control 18 will set to its 1 state to disable the Step Counter and halt the computer. 
 Similarly, the 0 and l outputs respectively of flipflops 153 and 154 couple to the inputs of a second inverter 169, the non-inverting output 164 from which is used to develop a predetermined control pressure during a Transfer or T instruction. In more particular, line 164 is considered to be selected when its pressure is at a low level. This occurs when both inputs to the inverter 169 are at a low level, which in turn occurs when flip-laps 153 and 154 are respectivciy set to the state (M4 M3=10). This condition develops when a Transfer instruction has been set up in the Instruction Decode 15. During all other setting of flip-flops 153 and 154, the pressure on the output 164 is maintained high. 
 The ()0 outputs from flip- 10138 153 and 154 are connected to the inputs of a third inverter 176, the noninverting output 165 from which is used to develop a selected control pressure during a lump or J instruction. In more particular control line 165 is considered selected when its pressure is low. This occurs when both inputs to inverter 1711 are low or when the flip-flops 153 and 154 are set to their 11 state (M4 M3=11). This condition develops when a lump instruction has been set up in the Instruction Decode 15. For all other settings of fiip flops 153 and 154, the pressure on line 165 is maintained high. 
 Finally, the 10 outputs respectively of flip-flops 153 and 154 are coupled to the inputs of a fourth inverter 171, 
the non-inverting output from which feeds two control lines 166 and 167. These lines are used to develop a selected control pressure during an Add or A instruction. In more particular,-lines 166 (A1) and 167 (A2) are considered selected when their pressure is low. This occurs when both inputs to the inverter 171 are low or when the flip-flops 153 and 154 are set respectively to their 01 state (M4 M3=0l). This condition develops when an Add or A instruction has been set up in the Decode 15. For all other settings of flip-flops 153 and 154 the pressure on lines 166 and 167 is maintained high. 
 The setting of flip-flops 153 and 154 in addition to being controlled from the 111 and m memory lines, can also be controlled manually by the keys K. To this end, each of the four keys K couple to four high pressure lines 172 through 175. The outputs from each of these lines are coupled to the input of the respective OR gates 157, 161, 158 and 162. The output from these OR gates feed to the inputs of flip-flops 153 and 154 whereby manual actuation of any one or two of the keys will set the flip-flops 153 and 154 to any one of their four combinatorial conditions. 
Static Register 14 The Static Register 14, which in eifect is a continuation of the Instruction Decode 15, is the device for storing the M2 and M1 bits (address portion) of an instruction, and will be the next component to be described by reference to FIGURE 12d. 
 Like the Instruction Decode, 15, the Static Register 14 comprises a pair of flip-flops 176 and 177. These flipfiops receive, respectively, the M2 and M1 bits from the complement output lines 1112 and MT of the Memory 10 as will be described. The W output line from the Memory 11 is coupled to one input of an AND gate 178, the output of which is fed through an OR gate 131) to the 0 input nozzle of flip-fiop 176. Similarly, the H1 output line of the Memory 10 is coupled to one input of an AND gate 175, the output of which is fed through an OR gate 181 to the 0 input nozzle of flip-flop 177 The other input to gates 178 and 179 is derived from the (4A) control line 132 of the Function Select 16. The (4A) control line 182, as will be described, is normally at a low pressure level except at the clock pulse time of the 10 step of the Step Counter 17 as indicated by Waveform E FIGURE 2. At this time, pressure in the (4A) control line 182 rises to a high level and the M2 and M1 instruction bits then appearing on the and IE1 output lines of Memory 10 will be gated into the fiip-lops 176 and 177. The setting of flip-flops 176 and 177 operates, as will be described in detail, through the Memory Select component 12, to select an address in the Memory 111 from which an operand may be read or into which a result may be written. 
The Static Register 14 hip-flops 176 and 177 like the Instruction Decode 15 should be cleared to a reference condition before the new M2 and M1 bits are stored therein. The clearing of the Static Register 14 is done by a high pressure signal developed on the (31)) control line of the Function Select 16. This high pressure signal, as indicated by Waveform B, FIGURE 2, is deveioped, as will be described, during the 11 step of the Step Counter 17 is and fed through the control line 183 and the OR gates 184 and 185 to the 1 input nozzles of flip-flops 176 and 177. This signal clears the flip-flops to their 11. state in preparation of the receipt of the M2 and M1 bits of the instruction during the next step of the Step Counter 17. 
The setting of flip-flops 176 and 177, in addition to being controlled from the T12 and F11 memory lines of Memory 111 can also be controlled manually by the four keys K. Each of these keys K couple to four high pressure lines 1186, 186a, 187 and 187a. The outputs from each of these lines are coupled to the inputs of the OR of the second stage 188 conditions gate 201. 
gates 185, 131, 184 and 1811. The output from these OR gates feed the inputs of the flip-flops 1'76 and 177 whereby manual actuation of any one or two of the keys will set up the flip-flops 1'76 and 177 to any one of their four combinatorial conditions. It is obvious, however, that in the manual actuation of these keys, only one key associated with each of the fiips-lops 176 and 177 should be actuated at any given time, since the actuation of both keys of a single flip-flop would produce a cancelling effect one upon the other. 
Control Counter 13 Before describing how the output of the Static Register 14 is decoded by the Memory Select 12 to address the Memory 10 for purposes of reading an operand therefrom or for writing a result therein, the construction and operation of the Control Counter 13 which is used to address the Memory 11 for instructions will be described by reference to FIGURE 12d. 
 The Control Counter 13 like the Step Counter 17 comprises a pair of flip-flops 138 and 189 which are interconnected so as to form a scale-of-four counter operating to count in the Gray Code. 
 As shown in FIGURE 12d, the O or C1 output of the first stage 189 of the Counter 13 is connected through a small delay element 1%, AND gate 191, OR gate 192 to the input of the second stage 188. Similarly, the l or C1 output of the first stage 189 is connected through a small delay element 193, AND gate 194, and OR gate 195 to the 1 input of the second stage 188. The second input to each of the AND gates 191 and 194 isobtained from the (3A) control line 196 of the Function Select 16. As indicated by Waveform C of FIGURE 2, the (3A) control line 196, as will be described, develops a high pressure output level once every cycle of the Step Counter 17. This high pressure signal which occurs at clock time every 11 step of Counter 17 operates to switch the second stage of the Counter 13 in dependence upon the existing state of the first stage. 
 In a manner converse to that just described, the 1 or C2 output of the second stage flip-flop 188 is connected through a small delay element 197, AND gate 198 and OR gate 199 to the 0 input nozzle of the first stage flip-flop 189. Similarly, the 0 or C2 output of the second stage flip-flop 18% is connected through a small delay element 261), AND gate 2111 and OR gate 202 to the 1 input of the first stage flip-flop 189. The second input to each of the AND gates 1% and 201 is derived from the (33) control line 203 of the Function Select 16. Again as indicated by Waveform C, FIGURE 2, the (33) control line 293, as will be described, develops a high pressure signal once every cycle of the Step Counter 1'7. This high pressure signal which occurs at clock time every 11 step of Counter 17 operates to switch the first stage of the Counter 13 according to the state of the second stage 183. 
 The purpose of the small delays and their sizes are as described in connection with delays 121, 126, 129 and 134- in the Step Counter 17. 
 The interconnections of the outputs and inputs of the first and second stages 189 and 188 cause the Counter 13 to switch according to the Gray Code with each of the stepping pulses derived from the (3A) and (3B) control lines of the Function Select 16. In more particular, assume that the Counter 13 is in its 00 state. The 0 or m output of the first stage 189 conditions gate 191 of the second stage 188, .and the 0 or 62 output The high pressure stepping pulse appearing on lines (3A) and (3B) passes gates 191 and 201. That passing through gate 191 is applied to the 0 input of the flip-flop 188 and is ineffective to switch this flip-flop since this flip-flop is already in its 0 state. That pulse passing gate 201, however, is applied to the "1 input of flip-flop 189 and switches this flip-flop to its 1 state. Thus at the end of the first stepping pulse on lines (3A) and (3B), the Counter 13 is set to its 01 state. The 01 state conditions gates 194 of the second stage and gate 201 of the first stage. The second high pressure stepping pulse appearing on the (3A) and (3B) advance lines thus passes through these gates. That passing gate 201 is ineffective to switch stage 189 because it is already in its 1 state. That passing gate 194, however, is applied to the 1 input of the Second stage flip-flop 188 and switches this stage to its 1 state. Thus at the end of the second stepping pulse Counter 13 is switched to its 11 state. The 11 state of the counter conditions gates 194 in the second stage and 198 in the first stage. Thus the third advance pulse appearing on lines (3A) and (3B) passes these gates to set the counter 13 to its 10 state. The 10 state conditions gates 198 and 191 so that upon receipt of the fourth advance pulse on control lines (3A) and (3B) the counter will step back to its 00 state thereby completing a cycle of operation. 
 The Control Counter 13 is also adapted to receive through a separate set of control gates the outputs of the Static Register 14. These separate set of control gates are rendered operative when a transfer of control is to be executed as the result of a Jump instruction. In this case, the M2 and M1, or address bits, stored in the Static Register 14 are jammed into the Control Counter 13 whereby the Memory address of the next instruction is dependent upon the address portion of the jump instruction under execution. 
 In more particular, the 1 or SR2 output and the 0 or W output of the second stage of the Static Register 14 are applied to AND gates 204a and 204, respectively, of the second stage of the Control Counter 13. The other input to these gates is taken from the (2C) control line 207 of the Function Select 16. The (2C) control line, as will be described, goes to a high pressure level to condition gates 204a and 204 during the execution of a Jump order whenever a transfer of control is to result. The output of gates 204a and 204 are applied as respective inputs to the OR gates and 192 whereby the l or SR2 output of gate 204a may be applied to the 1 input of flip-flop 188 and the 0 or SR? output of gate 2114 may be applied to the 0 input of flip-flop 188. 
 A similar connection is made between the outputs of the first stage of the Static Register 14 and the first stage of the Control Counter 13. More specifically, the 1 or SR1 output of flip-flop 177 and the 0 or fin output of this flip-flop are coupled respectively to AND gates 2115 and 206 of the first stage of the Control Counter 13. The second input to these gates is derived from the (2D) control line 268 of the Function Select 16. The (21)) control line develops a high pressure, as will be described, to condition gates 295 and 2% during the execution of a Jump order whenever a transfer of control is to take place. The output of gates 205 and 206 are applied as respective inputs to the OR gates 202 and 199 whereby the SR1 or 1 output of flip-flop 177 may be applied to the 1 input of Control Counter flip-flop 189 and the SE or 0 output of flip-flop 177 may be applied to the 0 input of Control Counter flipfiop 189. 
Memory Select 12 The next component to be described will be the Memory Select 12 which is shown in more detail in FIGURE 12 Reference is now made to this figure together with FIGURE 12d. 
 The Memory Select 12 is a decoding device which is used in addressing the Memory for an instruction or in addressing the Memory for storing an operand therein or for reading an operand therefrom. Instruction addresses are obtained from the output of the Control Counter 13 while operand addresses are obtained from the output of the Static Register 14. Accordingly, the input to the Memory Select 12 includestwo sets of input AND gates. The first set is used to couple the address information from the Control Counter 13 into the Memory Select 12, and the second set is used to couple the address information from Static Register 14 into the Memory Select 12. 
 The first set of input AND gates to the Memory Select 12 comprises gates 211 and 212. Gate 212 receives as one input thereto, the 1 or C1 output of the first stage 189 of the Control Counter 13, while gate 211 receives as one input thereto, the 1 or C2 output of the second stage 188 of the Control Counter. The other input to these gates is derived from the noninverting output 215 of an inverter 213. The input to the inverter 213 is derived from the (40) control line 216 of the Function Select 16. The (4C) control line 216, as will be described and as shown by Waveform D, FIGURE 2, goes high during the step of the Step Counter 17. At all other times, the output pressure on the (4C) control line 216, is low, and the inverting output 214 of inverter 213 is high. During the high pressure condition on the (4C) line 216, however, the noninverting output 215 of inverter 213 goes high to condition gates 211 and 212 and thereby to gate the outputs from the Control Counter 13 into the Memory Select component 12. 
 The second set of input AND gates to the Memory Select 12 comprises gates 209 and 210. Gate 2101cceives as one input thereto, the 1 or SR1 output of the first stage 177 of the Static Register 14, while gate 209 receives as one input thereto, the 1 or SR2 output of the second stage 176 of the Static Register 14. The other input to gates 209 and 210 is derived from the inverting output 214 of inverter 213. The inverting output 214 from inverter 213, being normally high, conclitions gates 209 and 210 to thereby gate the output from the Static Register 14 into the Memory Select Component 12. 
 The output of the input AND gates 209 to 212 serve as the inputs to a pair of amplyifying OR/NOR gates 217 and 218, with the outputs from gates 210 and 212 providing the input to gate 217 and the outputs from gates 269 and 211 serving as the inputs to gate 218. The gates 217 and 218 each provide two outputs, a noninverting output 219 for gate 218 and 221 for gate 217 and an inverting output 220 for gate 218 and 222 for gate 217. The four outputs from the two gates 217 and 218 are then finally gated together in four amplifying OR/NOR elements 223 to 226 to provide the final line selection for addressing the memory. One gate 223 to 226 for each word address in the memory. In more particular, the non-inverting outputs 219 from gate 218 and 221 for gate 217 connect to the two inputs for gate 223; the non-inverting output 219 from gate 218and the inverting output 222 from gate 217 connect to the two inputs for gate 224; the inverting outputs 220 from gate 218 and 222 from gate 217 connect to the two inputs for gate 225; and finally the inverting output 220 for gate 217 and non-inverting output 221 from gate 217 connect to the two inputs for gate 226. 
 The interconnections between gate 217 and 218 and the four final gates 223 to 226 are such that the memory address corresponding to one of the gates 223 to 226 is said to be selected when both inputs to that gate 223 to 226 are in their low pressure states. Each of these gates 223 to 226 provides a non-inverting output and an inverting output. For gate 223, line 227 represents the non-inverting output and 228 the inverting output. When a gate 223 to 226 has been selected its inverting output is at a high pressure level and its non-inverting output is at a low pressure level. All other non-selected gates 223 to 226 have the reverse pressure conditions on their inverting and non-inverting outputs. The high pressure inverting output is used, as hereinafter described, 
to effect a read out from the selected memory address, while the non-inverting output is used in writing into the selected address. 
1 To illustrate the operation of the Memory Select 12, assume that the (4C) control line 216 is in its high pressure state and that input gates 211 and 212 are conditioned by virtue of the high pressure on line 215 while gates 209 and 210 are non-permissive. Assume also that the Control Counter 13 is in its 00 state. Then from the schedule below the first word in the memory should be selected. 
Bit code: Word number 00 1 01 2 11 3 10 4 From the above assumptions it will be seen that the output from all the input AND gates 209 through 212 are low and that both inputs to bothgates 217 and 218 are in their low pressure states. The non-inverting outputs 219 from gate 218 and 221 from gate 217 are therefore both low and the inverting outputs 220 from gate 218 and 222 from gate 217 are both high. Thus only gate 223 of the group 223 to 226 have both inputs in their low pressure states. All other gates 24 to 226 have at least one high input pressure. Therefore gate 223 is selected to the exclusion of the other gates 224 to 226. 
 Continuing with the illustration, assume now that the setting of the Control Counter 13 has been advanced to its 0 1 state and that input gates 211 and 212 are conditioned by a high pressure signal on line 215. In this case, the output pressure from AND gate 212 is high and the output pressure from AND gates 209 to 211 are all low. Thus in this case, both inputs to gate 218 are low whereby the non-inverting output 219 from this gate is low and its inverting output 220 is high. In the case of gate 217, however, the input thereto from gate 212 is high due to the 1 output from the Control Counter flip-flop 189. This causes the non-inverting output 221 from gate 217 to be high and the inverting output 222 to be low. In this condition only gate 224 will have both of its inputs low and this gate will be selected. All other gates 223, 225 and 226 will have at least one high pressure input and will not therefore be selected. Gate 224 therefore corresponds to word number 2 in the memory. 
 From the foregoing description, it will be seen that gate 225 (Memory Word 3) is selected when the Bit Input Code to the Memory Select 12 is 11 and finally gate 226 (memory word 4) will be selected when the bit input code to the Memory Select 12 is 10. 
 The foregoing description assumes that the Memory Select 12 is being actuated by the Control Counter 13; that is the Memory 10 is being addressed for a new instruction. The operation of the Memory Select 12 when the Memory 10 is being addressed for an operand by the Static Register 14 is the same as that described above. In this instance, however, the pressure on line 214 from inverter 213 is high and the input AND gates 209 and 210 are conditioned instread of input AND gates 211 and 212. This gates the setting of the Static Register 14 into the Memory Select 12 instread of the Control Counter 13 setting. 
Memory 10 The memory which is shown in FIGURE 12e comprises a plurality of groups of flip-flops, one group for each word of storage, with each group comprising a number of flip-flops equal to the number of bits in a word. In the present case where four, four bit words of storage is assumed, the four flip-flops comprising a word of storage are shown in the drawing as arrayed horizontally in a row. There are four such rows disposed vertically in the drawing to show the four words of storage.
