No. 13/425,955, filed Mar. 21, 2012, which is a Continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/637,950, filed Dec. 13, 2006, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/749,579, 60/756,549 and 60/762,861, respectively filed Dec. 13, 2005, Jan. 6, 2006 and Jan. 30, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In recent years, the use of cellular phones, music players, video players, video games, computers, and a variety of hand-held electronic products has greatly increased. Because they are hand-held, some of those electronic devices as computers are often carried by the user in a separate case. There have been attempts to create wearable electronics such as music players integrated into the frames of eyewear, as well as wearable computers. However, due to a disconnection between electronic products and the biological aspects of the human body, prior art devices have failed to provide a useful wearable electronic apparatus that adequately interact with the human body and which fits anatomically and physiologically with the body.
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide electronic devices and electronic functions which are hand-free and can be worn on the surface of the body in a biologically fit manner. The present invention provides a convergence between electronic products and the biological and anatomical aspects of the human body and biomechanics of the body while providing a series of hands-free wearable electronic apparatus that can interact with human senses and physiology of the body in a practical manner.
Housing electronics and/or power source in the frames of eyeglasses, as provided by prior art devices, creates bulky, heavy, cumbersome, and uncomfortable gear, which consistently places a heavy weight against the users' ears which can generate discomfort. Moreover, such heavy and awkward eyeglasses are cosmetically undesirable with buttons, ear buds, and other unattractive parts being visible at all times, taking away the elegance that can be the key feature of eyeglasses frames, and making them unsuited for use on a daily basis including at work, at school, or attending formal events.
A further problem for the prior art devices is that they rely on wires passing through the hinges at the front portion of the temples. This makes the manufacturing process difficult and more expensive. In addition, because the wires running through the hinges are repeatedly folded and unfolded with the temples of the glasses, the wires have a tendency to become damaged, substantially reducing the useful lifespan of the products.
The large size and heavy weight of eyeglass frames housing electronics can prevent a comfortable fit and use. U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040059212 and 20040242976 describe eyeglasses to measure biological parameters wirelessly. However, because the electronics and wireless transmitter are housed in the eyeglass frames, the frames are heavy and can cause discomfort over time.
Bulky, prior art eyeglass frames or head mounted gear that house electronics and/or power sources and/or and unsightly ear buds in a non-removable fashion require the user to wear the device at all times, even when the electronic functionality of the device is not being used.
The prior art also discloses âwearableâ computers. Typically, however, these devices are complicated and not practical to use. Moreover, because they are not adapted to fit well onto a human body, their weight is not well distributed, and will normally cause discomfort to the wearer, discouraging long term use of the devices.
Wearable articles of clothing (including hats) with permanent electronics embedded on them are financially unattractive, because discarding the wearable article would also require throwing away the embedded electronics device. Similarly, a desire to replace or upgrade the electronics device requires disposal of the wearable article.
Many people use different types of portable electronic devices, such as cell phones, MP3 players, PDA's, etc. Another deficiency of the prior art is a failure to disclose eyeglasses or wearable articles in which the user has the option to choose from a plurality of electronic functionalities using the same eyeglasses frame or wearable article.
Another problem with electronic devices such as computers, DVD players, cellular telephone, digital music player, and electronic organizers, is that in order to be operated they require the user to hold the device or place the device on an object (such as a piece of furniture or the floor) for support. It would be very useful to have an electronic device which does not require being held or placed on an object for support.
In addition, âhand-heldâ devices require that they be held. While some cellular phones and digital music/video players have accessories that permit the user to use the device without having to hold it, using such apparatus and accessories is cumbersome, and it is necessary to carry and store the accessories until they are actually used. Furthermore, it is easy to forget to bring the accessory, such as the ear bud or a strap to secure a digital player to the body, when is needed.
Moreover, hand-held devices are easily lost or misplaced, and unattended hand-held devices can be easily stolen. It is common for people to forget their hand-held devices in restaurants, airplanes, taxi cabs, etc. It would be very useful to have a non-hand held and hands-free device that can be worn in a comfortable, non-obtrusive, and biologically-fit manner without requiring the user to carry extra devices or accessories in addition to the equipment already being worn on the body.
The Problem of Pain and Discomfort
The human body has a limited ability to support weight before pain is elicited. Furthermore, each part of the human body, such as the neck, shoulder and ear has different thresholds for activation of pain fibers. If the weight pattern is not biologically fit, the stimulus of the device on the skin will become annoying, and pain receptor endings within the skin will be stimulated. By adequately spreading the weight of the electronic wearable article resting on the body only pressure receptors of the peripheral nerves are activated, and not the painful ânociceptorsâ (described further below). By providing a wearable electronic device with a biologically fit weight distribution pattern, the pain and discomfort associated with the weight of the device is not elicited.
There are basically three sensory responses from contacts with the human skin: (1) mechanical sensations, (2) thermal sensations, and (3) nociceptive or pain sensations. Nerve fibers course into the skin through the dermis, and many of them end at the dermal-epidermal border where many of the sensory receptor structures are located. The largest class of receptors consists of the ones with no specialized structure at all, which are the free nerve endings for pain whereas encapsulated nerve endings are usually associated with light touch and pressure sensations.
Axons of peripheral nerves are divided up, according to their conduction velocity, into A, B and C fibers, and the A fibers are subdivided into A.alpha., A.beta., A.gamma., and A.delta. classes, in descending order of conduction velocity. Ordinary sensory information such as touch information is conducted by A.beta. fibers, and pain sensation is carried by A.delta. and C fibers. For any wearable electronic article to be worn comfortably for long periods of time, the design and weight distribution as well as the weight pattern of the apparatus should not activate A.delta. and C fibers of the anatomic region supporting the electronic device.
The pain receptors and C fibers in the skin of the ear are activated at much earlier stage than the pain receptors and C fibers of the nose. Therefore, to prevent activation of the user's pain receptors, a biologically fit weight pattern for eyeglasses distributes as much weight as possible onto the nose and as little as possible directly against the ear. Likewise, the C fibers, pain receptors and pressure receptors in the neck are activated earlier than the C-fibers, pain receptors, and pressure receptors of the shoulder and chest. Therefore, to increase the time prior to activation of pain receptors, a biologically fit weight pattern, for a wearable computer for example, includes distributing the weight in the shoulder and chest area and avoiding the weight being supported solely or mainly by the neck. Other biologically fit embodiments that distribute the weight in the back and shoulder area will be shown in the accompanying drawings and description.
Good weight distribution, as taught by the present invention, needs to be coupled to a proper amount of weight, to avoid activating mechanically sensitive nociceptors, which lead to discomfort and painful sensation. To prevent stimulation of pain, it is necessary that the weight of the apparatus applied to the anatomic area only activates pressure receptors but not C fibers and pain receptors. In the case of wearable electronics, C fibers can be activated by excessive pressure itself and chemicals released by damaged cells, such as crush injury, caused the weight of the device. This is important from a clinical stand point and future ability to wear the wearable electronic article, since after activation of C fiber, the next time that the user tries to wear an even lighter weight device in the same area, pain may result, a phenomenon called hyperalgia, preventing thus future use of the device for a potentially long period of time.
Receptors are discrete structures connected to nerve fibers and embedded in the skin. Although in some regions the density of receptors is very high, there are areas in which there are few receptors. The receptors in the skin of neck and ear, represented by anatomic areas supporting devices of the prior art, are very sensitive to mechanical stimuli, requiring displacements of only a few to tens of micrometers to excite them. When the stimuli is strong enough it can produce damage and become painful. By having proper weight and proper weight distribution, as per the present invention, the pain fibers of the anatomic areas supporting the weight are not activated and over time the pressure fibers, such as A.beta. fibers, adapt to the weight, which allows absolute comfort during use.
As a way of illustration, but not of limitation, two anatomic areas of the body and their representative preferred embodiments, wearable electronic eyeglasses and wearable computer, will be described. People who wear eyeglasses usually see indentation on the skin of the nose, but feel no significant discomfort. On the other hand, significant discomfort is felt when only minor mispositioning of temples occur around the ear. This occurs because the skin in the nose area has few pain receptors and C fibers, while the skin around the ear is more densely populated with pain receptors and C fibers.
It is possible to quantify the sensitivity of an anatomic area. The number of receptor locations for pain in the ear per square centimeter is in the range of 120 to 160 in comparison to the nose which is in the range of 35 to 55. The number of receptor locations for touch per square centimeter in the ear is in the range of 40 to 70 in comparison to the nose which is in the range of 90 to 110.
Even regular eyeglasses with conventional weight can cause discomfort around the skin of the ear if there is not a good fit because of the larger density of pain receptors in this area. Naturally, placing weight against the ear by temples housing electronics and/or power sources will likely elicit discomfort and pain over time. Therefore by mechanically displacing the weight to other areas that have less pain receptors and fibers, such as the nose, there is a reduction in the amount of pain receptors that will be activated, and an increase in the comfort level of the wearer.
The number of receptor locations for pain in the neck per square centimeter is in the range of 170 to 200 in comparison to the shoulder and chest which is in the range of 120 to 150. Therefore by mechanically displacing the weight from the neck to other areas that have less pain fibers, such as the shoulder and chest, there is a reduction in the amount of pain fibers and receptors activated.
The problem of wearable devices is further compounded by the fact that a wearable device to be truly useful has to be compact and interact with senses and biological functions of the body in a practical manner.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention teaches a convergence between electronic products and the biological and anatomical aspects of the human body and biomechanics of the body while providing a series of hands-free wearable electronic apparatus that can interact with human senses and are biologically fit and provide a weight distribution that does not activate pain fibers (and cause pain).
A variety of wearable electronic devices are provided in the present invention including computing devices, video players, music players, and the like. One of the wearable articles of the present invention housing electronics includes eyeglasses.
The invention provides eyeglasses with an optimal distribution of weight in which the nose area supports more of the weight due to a counter-weight, represented by an electronic package, preferably positioned diametrically opposed to the nose in the back of the head with said electronic package being secured to the end of the temples of pair of eyeglasses. By displacing the weight to the back of the head and to the nose and housing only light weight parts in the temples, there is better weight distribution and comfort, with elimination or retardation of activation of pain fibers and reduction of pressure applied by temples directly against the anatomic area of the ear, which is more sensitive to pain caused by pressure than the nose area.
The invention further provides a better distribution of weight in which the shoulder and chest area supports the structure in combination with the neck, represented by an Inverted U-shaped or an inverted V-shaped structure which has two arms resting against the shoulder and chest area in addition to the neck. By having two arms spaced apart there is spread of the weight with better balance and weight distribution across the neck and the shoulder and chest area.
The invention further teaches a weight distributed and biologically fit wearable computer. A variety of electronic parts and wireless parts can be integrated into the system. Accordingly, a cellular phone can be incorporated into the wearable computer with the dial pad being integrated into the keyboard, and hearing and voice function provided by the Inverted U-shape structure while allowing hands free communication. Likewise, a wireless communication system for receiving communications over the internet can be integrated into the wearable computer of the invention.
The present invention provides a fully compact system when not in use, and which allows full interaction of the device with vision, hearing, speech, and tactile function while being used. The V-shape structure preferably is made of a flexible material which has memory including memory shape alloys. Therefore, when not in use (for instance when being carried or being place on a table), the two ends of the structure can be folded upon each other and twisted in a helical shape placing the keyboard in one end of the arm on top of the display at the end of the opposite arm, creating a fully compact system. The present invention can also be used as a table-top, by having the helical shape being used with the vertical portion of the helical shape supporting the display in one end and the horizontal portion connected to the keyboard.
It is an object of the invention to provide a detachable wearable electronic eyeglasses and head mounted gear with a plurality of electronic functions and interchangeable electronic function. It is also an object of the invention to provide a wearable computer with optimal weight distribution and stretchable arms. It is a further object of the invention to provide a plurality of hands-free wearable electronic devices including a video player, a music player, a video game, an electronic book, a global positioning system, a photo camera, a video camera, a television, a cordless phone, a cellular phone, and the like. It is yet another object of the invention to provide hands-free support structure for housing electronics.
Eyeglasses are one of the most common wearable articles, and the majority of the adult population wears at least one of sunglasses or prescription eyeglasses for distance or for reading. It would be thus useful and desirable, as in accordance to this invention, to enable people wearing eyeglasses in general to have those eyeglasses perform an electronic function in a not noticeable manner and not seen by an external observer while keeping the frames light weight, elegant, compact, attractive, low cost and comfortable as well as biomechanically fit and practical for daily use in any situation of life. The eyewear of the invention doubles as an inconspicuous electronic device (besides having visual function as any eyeglasses), and since the eyeglasses of invention appear as regular eyeglasses, the eyeglasses can be used by the general population and for any occasion, such as at work, school, home, or during play.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Besides eyeglasses, a variety of other wearable articles such as head mounted gear, hats, eye masks, helmets, visors, and the like are commonly worn on the body but are not electronically enabled and not biomechanically fit for wearable electronics. It would be desirable, as in accordance to the present invention, to provide electronic capabilities to such wearable articles and fit an electronic system into such wearable articles with proper weight distribution while keeping such articles low-cost, comfortable, elegant, and easy-to-manufacture, with the electronics and electronic package being confined to the dimensions of the wearable article and being not visible to an external observer while providing vision, voice, and hearing interaction between the wearer and the device.
The present invention includes a miniaturized electronic system which fits into a wearable article (such as eyeglasses or hats) without significantly altering the wearable article. This is accomplished by reducing the number of parts of the electronic system that are permanently housed in the wearable article. The rest of the electronic system is included in a detachable electronic package (DEP) that can be attached to the wearable article in a way not to be visible to an external observer. The invention also eliminates the need for accessories such as ear buds, and reduces the number of the most expensive and heavier parts that are permanently affixed to the wearable article.
The present invention provides a wearable electronic article which comprises a DEP and a wearable article (WA) detachably connected to the DEP. Preferably, the connection between the DEP and the wearable article includes an extendable cord, most preferably a spool with retractable wires or a coiled wire capable of elongation and with spring capabilities. The DEP is releasably connected to an electrical connection in the wearable article (also referred as WA). The WA will also typically have electrical connections for ear buds, which are preferably permanently affixed to the WA. Preferably, the ear buds are connected to a spool with retractable wires or to a coiled wire capable of elongation and with spring capabilities. The DEP can include a variety of electronic devices such as digital music player, wireless communication devices, video player, video recording, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and the like.
By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, a preferred embodiment of the invention comprising eyeglasses will be described in detail. The detachable electronic eyeglasses system comprises a DEP having two wires preferably disposed on opposite ends of the DEP. These wires have electrical connections at their free ends which are releasably connected to electrical connections contained in the frame of a pair of eyeglasses.
The eyeglasses which are part of the claimed system comprise a front portion housing lenses and two temple portions disposed on opposite ends of the front portion. Each temple portion preferably houses a wire, an ear bud, and an electrical connection. The earbud is preferably hidden away within the frame structure or, most preferably, at the end of the frame. The dimensions of the ear buds are preferably confined to the dimensions of the frame. The electrical connection in each temple is releasably connected with the wires on the DEP. The connections within the temples are standardized so that different DEP's can be used in connection with the glasses, and the user has the option to choose a plurality of electronic packages using the same eyeglasses frame.
The electrical connections of the temples of the eyeglasses connect with the electrical connections of the DEP, forming a circuit through the DEP. No wires need be run through the hinges connecting the temple portions to the front portions of the frames.
The temple portions are adapted to secure or house electrical connections, wires, and an ear bud. Although the preferred embodiment preferably includes temples housing a wire, ear bud, and an electrical connection, it is understood that other parts including light weight and small microchips, or a small power source can be secured to or housed in said temples. It is also understood that the temples can include other parts such as micro optics for a camera such as for video or pictures, a light source, or a microphone while the main and heavy electronics are housed outside the frames, preferably in the DEP. For example, an eyeglass frame of the current invention for video recording could include the micro optics of a camera housed within the frame of the eyeglasses and the main electronics housed in the DEP. The lens, aperture, and a small image sensor, such as a Charge Coupled Device could be housed in the frame while the controls, processor, power source, circuits, and LCD screen are housed in the DEP.
In a preferred embodiment, the temples house the wires within the structure of the temples, with one end of said wire connected to an ear bud or to an electrical connection for an ear bud, and the opposite end of the wire having an electrical connector. Preferably, the electrical connector is located in the end portion of each temple, and most preferably at the free end of each the temple. Alternatively, the wire can be secured to the temple on top of the surface of the temple and not within the structure of the temple. This allows for an easier manufacturing process, particularly in the case of thin frames. Although the electrical connectors are preferably housed at the end of the temples, it is understood that the electrical connectors can be placed in any part of the frame, including the mid part of the temples.
The electrical connection at the end of the temple has means to be connected to another electrical connection, preferably one from the DEP. The electrical connectors at the free end of the temples are preferably connected to the free end of the wires which are connected to the DEP. To ensure a secure electrical connection between the DEP and the eyeglass frame, there is preferably a latching mechanism between the DEP and the eyeglass frames.
The electrical connectors in the frames of the eyeglasses are adapted to connect with a plurality of electronic devices housed in the DEP including a MP3 player, Bluetooth device, radio, video player, video recorder, voice recorder, game device, television, computerized electronic organizer, a radio reflective system, a Global Positioning system, a light source, and a cellular phone. The DEP can also include digital storage for a digital binocular for example with the binocular optics mounted in the frame of the eyeglasses and electronics and memory stored in the DEP. The invention creates eyeglasses enabled for an electronic function in which the same eyeglasses frame can receive a plurality of electronic capabilities depending on the attached DEP.
Thus, the invention provides electronically enabled eyeglasses for multiple functions without having to change the eyeglasses frame. The same discrete, light weight, elegant, and not noticeable electronic eyeglasses can play music and video or alternatively receive a phone call simply by replacing the type of DEP. In addition to replacing one DEP with one electronic function by another DEP with another electronic function, the present invention is also versatile and two or more electronic devices can be housed in the same electronic package.
The DEP is used for a specific period of time for that function, and then either stored or replaced by another DEP after the function is completed. For example a larger DEP can include a MP3 player and a digital video player when the user wants to see and hear, or the DEP can be real light weight when the user wants only Bluetooth capabilities, with such a DEP including a microphone. It is understood that a DEP with multiple electronic functions can be used and thus only one DEP may be necessary.
The present invention allows any eyeglasses and head mounted gear (such as a hat or headband) to be electronically enabled including for delivering sound and video, without an added expense related to electronics and without creating a bulky and heavy head mounted gear. The manufacturing process is simple and cost effective, and in the case of eyeglasses includes only changing the temples, which houses a minimum amount of light weight and thin parts and with no buttons in the frame, thereby allowing use of eyeglasses which looks like conventional eyeglasses. Whenever the user wants to listen to music, watch a video, play a game, or answer a cell phone, all functions are at the finger tips by simply electrically connecting the DEP to the frame of the eyeglasses or other head mounted gear. The DEP can also include a wireless transmitter for transmitting a biological measurement by eyeglasses and head mounted gear, as described by in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040059212 and 20040242976.
The present invention also provides an electronic clip-on and a slip-on system which comprises a specialized clip-on of special dimensions with electronic capabilities and wiring for connecting one end of the clip-on in one temple with the opposite temple without going through a hinge mechanism or having the wire bent. The specialized clip-on and slip-on for frames of eyewear includes specialized retractable ear buds and electrical connections of special dimensions. It is also understood that the clip-on and slip-on embodiment can include a dual side clip-on or slip-on which houses ear buds in both sides (right and left), and one side houses electronics and power source, with said both sides (right and left) of the clip-on being electrically connected by a cable that extend along the back of the head or neck of the wearer.
It will be appreciated that the features of the invention optimize the use of head mounted gear and the frame of eyeglasses to be used as means to deliver sound and video to a user, without changing the comfort, style, and weight of the eyeglass frames, since the heavy, bulky, and cumbersome electronics are not housed in the frames. The present invention optimizes all areas by allowing the user to wear regular eyeglasses and other head mounted gear while allowing enjoyment of sound and video with specialized temples housing special ear buds with retractable cords.
The invention provides an entirely new approach for electronic apparatus and wearable electronics and provides numerous advantages including:
    1. Extending the life of the electronics package because the electronics package is detachable from a short-lived WA that has a short life; 2. Extending the life of the WA because a broken or obsolete electronics component can be replaced with a new one, allowing for continued use of the WA; 3. Preserving and enhancing the comfort and usability of the WA, because the electronics need only be secured to the WA when the electronic function is being used; 4. Enhancing usability and preserving elegance and comfort of the wearable electronics since the electronics are small and confined to the dimensions of the WA; 5. Preserving elegance and function of the WA because the electronics and other parts are not visible to an external observer and the electronics, wires, and ear buds do not alter or distort the WA; 6. Expanding the utility of the DEP because the same DEP can be coupled with a variety of WA's such as eyeglasses, hats, helmets, visors, eye masks, and the like; 7. Increasing the durability of the DEP by keeping it away from the WA during situations that put the electronic package at risk of damage such as during cleaning of the WA; 8. Enhancing usage by providing a system that permits a user to experience each of vision, speech, and hearing in conjunction with a wearable electronic device; 9. Expanding the utility of a WA, which now can perform an electronic function; 10. Increasing the value of a WA, which while still very low cost is able to perform an electronic function; 11. Enhancing convenience of use of the system by eliminating the need to carry and store key accessories such as ear buds; 12. Limiting the possibility of the DEP being easily stolen or forgotten by the electronic device being felt at all times and worn on the surface of the body; 13. Increasing the adaptability of the DEP for by people of any size and weight, because the DEP can universally fit any size of wearable articles; and 14. Natural usage of the electronics by the electronics being held in position due to gravity and support of a body part and without the need of fastening the electronic device to the body.   
A further example of a possible user of an embodiment of the present invention is a doctor. Ordinarily, it would not be acceptable for a doctor to wear heavy and bulky eyeglasses with visible electronics, buttons, or ear buds, as found in the prior art, because such features would be noticeable to a patient who is being examined Such eyeglassesâwhich could be perceived as weird or frighteningâcould take away the seriousness of the doctor-patient relationship, and would not be helpfulâor even, in some cases, permittedâat hospital or during delivery of health care. (This is also likely the case in any serious working environment or at school.) Furthermore, such weird and bulky eyeglasses could create unnecessary distraction to others. Since the eyeglasses (and other head mounted gear) of the present invention serve as an inconspicuous electronic device, such as a music player, the doctor could, for example, carry a DEP for playing music. During lunch, the doctor may wish to listen to some music, and connects the music playing DEP to the frames. He or she can then pull out the retractable ear buds from the temples of the eyeglasses and place them on the ears. The doctor may then, in a unremarkable manner, enjoy music since the only apparent parts are small ear buds. The DEP is camouflaged in the back of the head almost as regular cords for holding eyeglasses on the head. In order to better hide the DEP, the wires and system can be preferably encased in neoprene, leather, fabric, or similar material not easily visible. After the doctor finishes lunch, he allows the ear buds to retract back into the temples, disconnects the DEP from the temples, and puts the DEP away in a pocket Immediately, the electronically capable eyeglasses look like regular eyeglasses without any cord hanging from the temples.
The doctor could also, for example. keep the DEP connected to the frames. Because the DEP is hidden behind the head and is unobtrusive, it would not hinder the doctor in his or her work or get in the way of examining patients. By keeping the DEP connected to the frames (or a different DEP), the doctor could take advantage of a small camera system housed in the frames while bulky electronics, circuit, and digital storage are housed in the DEP. This could allow the doctor to photograph portions of a patient's body, for example, a cancer lesion, simply by using eyeglasses already worn by the doctor. The photograph is stored in the DEP, and can be uploaded to a computer or television for analysis or storage. The eyeglasses can also be enabled with silicon microdisplay capabilities on the lens to permit the doctor to see the image to make sure the stored image includes all aspects required.
The doctor can use the DEP MP3 during lunch, the DEP camera for work, and a Bluetooth enabled telephone when going home. The eyeglasses can, therefore, provide multiple electronic functions. After getting home, the doctor may still need the eyeglasses for vision correction, but not for any further electronic functionality. Thus, the doctor puts the ear buds back in the temples and disconnect the DEP. With the ear buds hidden in the temples and no DEP connected, the eyeglasses turn into conventional eyeglasses.
Having eyeglasses with hanging and noticeable ear buds and electronics housed in the frame the whole time as provided by the prior art sends a message that the primary interest of that wearer is to listen to music or other things, not human voice. With the eyeglasses system of the invention, the user when comes back home can disconnect the DEP and hide the ear buds, and by wearing regular looking eyeglasses indicate interest in listening to people. After dinner, the doctor plugs the DEP Digital Video Player and using the retractable cord attached to the DEP places the display in front of the eyes and watches a video. Before going to bed, the user plugs in DEP digital audio player into the eyeglasses and listen to a speech recorded while wearing the eyeglasses with built-in microphone (since the digital storage and electronics are housed in the DEP, only a 1 mm in diameter microphone and a thin wire are housed in the structure of the eyeglasses frame).
The same DEP can be used with a variety of different WA's. For example, when the user goes to bed, the user who wants to sleep at the sound of music, grab the same DEP MP3 used during lunch time at work, but the same DEP MP3 is now plug into the eye mask instead of the eyeglasses. The user then places the ear buds from the eye mask on to the ears, cover the eyes with the eye mask, turn on the system, and goes to sleep at the sound of a soothing music. After waking up in the morning, the user can exercise while listening to music from a DEP attached to an electronically enabled cap.
Similarly, the user can wear an Inverted U-shape wearable PC to the airport. While listening to music with the electronic eyeglasses, the user works on a PowerPoint presentation using the Inverted U-shape wearable computer while waiting on security lines and waiting for the flight. During the flight, the user uses the Inverted U-shape wearable PC to do work and watch a movie. The keyboard and display of the Inverted U-shape PC can virtually âfloatâ in the air at any height due to the self-adjusting extendable arms. Therefore, if a meal is served the user does not need to close the computer and stop viewing the movie or doing work. The keyboard is moved up and positioned over the tray table while the meal is placed on the tray table, allowing continue viewing a movie or doing work without interruption during the meal. This closes a 24 hour cycle wearing different wearable electronic devices for different activities and electronic functions.
Because the electronics are detachably connected to the WA's such as the eyeglasses and eye mask, the WA's can be cleaned and washed without jeopardizing the sensitive electronics, and when discarding the WA, the user can keep expensive electronics and reuse in another WA adapted to receive the electronic package.
The present invention also includes a method of using wearable electronics, comprising the steps of (1) affixing electrical connectors and wires to a wearable article, (2) electrically connecting in a releasable manner the electrical connector of the wearable article to a detachable electronic package resting against the structure of the WA, (3) activating an energy source to power the detachable electronic package, and (4) delivering at least one of sound or visual signal to the user through the wearable article.
A further aspect of the invention is a method of using a wearable computer, the wearable computer being a Inverted U-shape PC with two arms combining an extendable portion and accordion portion, said method comprising the steps of:
    1. connecting a keyboard to one arm, 2. connecting a display to the opposite arm, 3. creating a wired or wireless connection between the display and the keyboard, 4. activating a power supply, and 5. generating a processing function housed in either the display or keyboard.   
Alternatively, the steps could include:
    1. connecting a keyboard to one arm, 2. connecting a display to the opposite arm, 3. connecting a processor to the keyboard and/or display, 4. creating a wired or wireless connection for connecting the display, the keyboard, and processor 5. activating a power supply, and 6. generating a processing function in the processor part.   
The invention further comprises a method of playing a DVD on a wearable device comprising the steps of:
    1. connecting a disc player to one arm, 2. connecting a display to the opposite arm, 3. connecting a power supply to the display and/or disc player, 4. creating a wired or wireless connection for connecting the display, the disc player, and power supply 5. activating the power supply, and 6. generating an electronic function in the disc player.   
The invention further comprises a method of playing video games on a wearable computer, comprising the steps of:
    1. connecting a video game control to one arm, 2. connecting a display to the opposite arm, 3. connecting a processor to the display and/or video game control, 4. connecting a power supply to the processor, 5. creating a wired or wireless connection for connecting the display, the video game control, the processor, and the power supply, 6. activating the power supply, 7. generating an electronic function in the processor, and 8. generating at least a visual signal in the display.   
A further embodiment of the invention is a method of watching images using a wearable system comprising the steps of:
    1. securing an imaging device to the end of the gooseneck arm of a support structure combining an extendable accordion portion and a flexible gooseneck portion 2. positioning the support structure around a portion of the body 3. elongating the stretchable arm secured to the imaging device, 4. positioning the imaging device within the visual axis of the eye 5. activating a power supply, 6. generating an electronic function in the imaging device, and 7. generating a visual signal in the imaging device.   
The invention also comprises a method for using a hands-free wearable electronic device comprising the steps of:
    1. securing an electronic package to the end of an arm of a support structure combining an extendable accordion portion and a flexible gooseneck portion 2. positioning the support structure around a portion of the body 3. elongating the extendable portion of the support structure, 4. adjusting the arm to position the electronic package in line with the eyes 5. activating the power supply, and 6. generating an electronic function in the electronic package.   
Other features, benefits, and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
 FIG. 1A shows an electronically-enabled pair of eyeglasses from the prior art. Electronics 1 are housed in temples 2 of the eyeglasses, or in the area adjacent to nose bridge 3. Arrow A represents the large amount of weight that is placed directly against the skin of ear region 2 a, thereby promoting activation of pain fibers along the ear and provoking user discomfort. Also, with electronics 1 in temples 2, nose bridge 3 is weighed down, as represented by arrow B. This creates further discomfort, by encouraging the eyeglasses to slide down the wearer's nose.
 FIG. 1B shows an illustration of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. DEP 4 is positioned at the back of the head, preferably opposite to nose bridge 3. Temple 5 is thin, light weight and has no internal electronics. A second temple on the other side of the head is not shown. Ear bud 6 is connected to temple 5 by light weight coiled wire 7. The vector force, represented by arrow C, pulls the frame downward and applies a force to displace nose bridge 3 perpendicular to the plane of the face, represented by vector D. This transfers support of the eyeglasses to the nose, which is a less sensitive area than the ear, by reducing the weight applied to the ears (represented by smaller arrow E). This limits the activation of pain fibers in the more sensitive anatomic region of the ear.
 FIG. 1C shows a top perspective view of a detachable electronic eyewear system of the invention. Detachable wearable electronic system 10 of the invention comprises electronic eyeglasses frame 30 and detachable electronic package (DEP) 20. Detachable electronic eyeglasses frame 30 has two lens rims 58 and 60 and two temples, right temple 14 and left temple 16. Lens rims 58 and 60 can hold any type of lens (e.g. prescription, tinted, bifocal, clear, etc.). Right and left temples 14 and 16 each comprise two portions, right and left front portions 52 and 56, and right and left end portions 13 and 11. Front portions 52 and 56 define portions which are intended to extend along the side of user's head to the user's ear. Right and left end portions 13 and 11 include right and left free ends 37 and 35. Right end portion 13 preferably houses right ear bud 40, right coiled wire 48, and right connecting wire 50. Right connecting wire 50 connects ear bud 40 with coiled wired 48. Left end portion 11 preferably houses left ear bud 44, left coiled wire 46, and left connecting wire 54. Coiled wires 48 and 46 can elongate and retract and have spring capabilities. Alternatively coiled wires 48 and 46 can be secured to small spring loaded wheels or spools 15 and 17 with retracting capabilities. Either option allows ear buds 40 and 44 to be easily retracted for use and put back and hidden in temples 14 and 16 after use. Free ends 35 and 37 define ear portions which are shaped for placement around the wearer's ears. Free end portion 37 includes right electrical connector 36 and right wire 38 that connects right electrical connector 36 to ear bud 40 through wire 50. Free end portion 35 includes left electrical connector 34 and left wire 42 that connects left electrical connector 34 to ear bud 44 through wire 54.
Detachable electronic package (DEP) 20 is intended to extend across the neck or the back of the wearer's head and includes an electronics package 12, right cord 18 and left cord 22. Preferably right cord 18 and left cord 22 are disposed on opposite ends of electronic package 12. Right cord 18 houses right wire 26 which has electrical connection 28 on its end which can be releasably connected to electrical connection 36 of right temple 14. Left cord 22 houses left wire 24 which has an electrical connection 32 on its end which is releasably connected with electrical connection 34 of left temple 16. Electronics package 12 includes display 68, memory 62, power source 67, standard control buttons 66 such as play, stop, forward, and rewind and volume control, and conventional entry ports 65 for USB or computer connection for downloading/uploading as well as circuit board and microchips (not shown) well known in the art for controlling operations. Memory 62 may comprise known systems such as a flash memory or a hard drive. Electronics package 12 further includes retractable cord 71, which is preferably secured to a spring loaded wheel or spool 70 with retracting capabilities. This allows the electronics package to be easily retracted for use and put back and hidden in the back of the head after use. Display 68 can, for example, show the name of music being played or it could show a movie, by being brought from the back to the head into the visual axis of the eyes by extending retractable cord 71. Alternatively, instead of having wire 71 secured to spool 70, the DEP can have a coiled wire with retracting capabilities that can elongate for viewing the DEP and retract to its original position after use.
Electronics package 12 is preferably kept hidden behind the head, out of sight of the wearer as well as an external observer. Accordingly, control buttons 66 preferably have raised features or special positioning to allow the user to easily identify and use buttons 66 when electronics package 12 cannot been seen by the user. For instance, on the top part of electronics package 12 the first button (e.g., press button) is stop, the second button is pause, and the third bottom is play. On the bottom part of electronics package 12 the first press button is rewind and the second is forward while a dial type button functions to change volume. Alternatively, a dial looking button such as is found in digital music players (eg. iPod of Apple Inc.) can be used.
In addition to ear buds secured to coiled cords capable of elongation and with spring capabilities, the invention can also use a spring loaded spool cord of special dimensions and length, and with retractable extension. The preferred diameter for ear bud cord is less than 2.5 mm, and preferably less than 1.5 mm and most preferably less than 1 mm in diameter. The preferred length for ear bud cord is equal to or less than 20 cm, and preferably equal to or less than 16 cm and most preferably equal to or less than 10 cm in length. The preferred combined length of right wire 26 and left wire 24 connected to electronics package 12 is equal to or less than 45 cm in length, and most preferably equal to or less than 35 cm in length, and even most preferably equal to or less than 30 cm in length. It is also understood that in order to make the DEP smaller and lighter, passive means for powering the DEP can be used, in which the DEP receives energy from a remote source by electromagnetic induction, radio waves, and the like.
 FIG. 1D shows a top view of a preferred embodiment of DEP 20 that includes a cradle-like housing 72 that defines a cavity 74 sized to accept and retain in a releasable manner electronics package 12, such as a digital music player, radio, cellular phone, a Global Positioning System, a personal digital assistant (e.g., Palm electronic organizer from Palm, Inc.), and the like. Release button 69 on the right side of housing 72 facilitates attaching and releasing electronics package 12 from the housing 72. Preferably, release button 69 is a spring-loaded mechanism that engages and retains a portion of electronics package 12 when in cradle cavity 74, and permits releasing the electronic package when needed. Right cord 18 and wire 26 have an electrical connector 28 at the free end, enter housing 72 in the right side, and connect with right wire 73 housed inside cavity 74. Wire 73 is connected to spool 70. Left cord 22 and wire 24 have an electrical connector 32 and enter housing 72 on the left side and connect with left wire 75 housed inside cavity 74. Wire 75 is connected to spool 70. Wires 73, 75 and spool 70 inside housing 72 are shown as broken down lines.
 FIG. 1E shows a side view of DEP 20 that includes cradle-like housing 72 that defines recess 74 sized to accept and retain in a releasable manner electronics package 12. Release button 69 holds electronics package 12 in recess 74. Spool 70 at the base of the cavity 74 has coiled wire 77, which is in electrical contact with right wire 73 and left wire 75. Coiled wire 77 is connected to electronic package 12 and works as a retractable/extendable wire via spool 70 to allow the user to bring the electronics package 12 from the back of the head to the visual axis of the eyes of the user by extending retractable wire 77. After looking at electronics package 12, the user may actuate spool 70âfor example with a gentle pullâretracting retractable wire 77 and bringing electronic package 12 back to cavity 74. Electronics package 12 includes display 68, key pad 79, microchip circuit 78 and battery 67. It is understood that in order to make electronics package 12 smaller and thinner, power source 67 and microchip circuit 78 and other hardware may be housed in housing 72. Wire 73 is in electrical connection with wire 26 and electrical connector 28. Wire 75 is in electrical connection with wire 24 and electrical connector 32. This embodiment illustrates the use of a retractable wire system. However, it should be understood that a non-coiled wire wrapped around a spring-loaded mechanism would provide the same functionality, as could other arrangements. Although a release button is a preferred embodiment, it will be understood that a release button is not necessary, and that the force of the spring can be used to anchor the electronics package in the cavity.
Electronics package 12, which can be, for example, a digital music player or cell phone, is connected to housing 72 of DEP 20 with retractable wire 77 secured to a spool 70. This allows the user to interact visually with electronics package 12, and provides interaction with the key biological function of vision, notwithstanding the fact that electronics package 12 is housed completely away from the eyes of the user. Therefore, for example, the invention allows a user wearing a DEP digital music player to extend retractable cord 77 until electronics package 12, illustrated as a MP3 player, can been seen by the user. The user can then view display 68 and make the selection of music of interest using buttons 79. After making a selection, the user can release wire 77, which retracts MP3 player 12 back into cavity 74 in the back of the head and bidden away. Likewise, if electronics package 12 is a cellular phone, the wearer can extend retractable cord 77, dial using key pad 79, and then return the DEP (cell phone) to the back of the head and away from sight from an external observer.
It will be understood that an electrical connection for an ear bud disposed in the temples of the eyeglasses can be used. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 1F, temple 19 a includes a first electrical connector 21 disposed in end portion 19 for connecting to an electronic device. Temple 19 a also has a second electrical connector 23 adjacent to first electrical connector 21 for an ear bud. Electrical connector 21 is, in this embodiment, a female connection used to connect DEP 21 a. Second electrical connector 23 for connecting with ear bud assembly 23 a, is also, in this embodiment, female. Wire 25 connects first electrical connector 21 with electrical connector 23. The same structure can be used for the opposite temple.
 FIG. 1G shows a prior art system, which provides ear buds for stereo sound comprising ear buds 27 and 29 connected by wires 31 and 33, which combine to form wire portion 39, which terminates at electrical plug 121. Electrical plug 121 is removably connected to prior art electronic device 121 a, which has a single jack 121 b to connect with electrical plug 121. Because the prior art did not converge the ear bud system with the anatomy of the user's body, only one jack 121 b is provided in the electronic device 121 a and excessively long wires are needed with a usual length from ear buds 27 and 29 to plug 121 being more than 90 cm.
By contrast, one aspect of the present invention is a specialized ear bud system for stereo sound. By adapting the electronics to human anatomy, ear buds with very short wires can be used. As shown in FIG. 1H, ear bud system 41 for stereo sound comprises two separate ear bud assemblies 43 and 45. Each ear bud assembly 43 and 45 includes ear buds 43 a and 45 a, electrical plugs 85 and 87 and a coiled wires 47 and 49, which can elongate for placement on the ears. The preferred length of wires 47 and 49 is less than 15 cm, more preferably less than 12 cm in length, and most preferably less than 10 cm in length. This compares with the 90 cm length of the prior art wires.
Each ear bud 43 a and 45 a has a plug 85 and 87 which is releasably connected to electrical connector 51 and 53. Connectors 51 and 53 in turn are connected to wires 55 and 57, which terminate at electrical connections 59 and 61, Electrical connections 59 and 61 are releasably connected through connectors 81 a and 83 a to wires 81 and 83 disposed in each side of DEP 63. DEP 63 is housed in cavity 137 and secured to cavity 137 by coiled wire 143, which is in electrical connection with wires 81 and 83. Coiled wire 143 is able to elongate and retract, allowing DEP 63 to be removed from cavity 137. It is contemplated that the ear bud system 41 of the inventionâcomprised of two separate ear budsâcould be used with a plurality of electronic devices of the invention. Ear bud assemblies 43 and 45 are not electrically connected to signal source and therefore cannot provide stereo sound without being connected to another electrical part. This is typically provided by the wearable electronic articles of present invention. Electronic devices of the prior art include only one jack for connecting one electrical plug for one ear bud assembly. Contrary to the prior art, and in order to create biologically fit wearable devices, the present invention teaches a method and device that uses two separate ear bud assemblies, and the wearable electronic articles of the invention preferably have two plugs for ear buds instead of one as provided by the prior art. It is also understood that a kit for stereo sound comprising a box housing two ear bud assemblies is within the scope of the invention.
 FIG. 1J shows another specialized ear bud system 41 for stereo sound coupled to detachable electronic package 63. Ear bud system 41 includes separate ear buds 43 and 45, which are attached to wires 101 and 107. Preferably, wires 101 and 107 are very short. Ear buds 43 and 45 have plugs 85 and 87 which are releasably connected to electrical connectors 51 and 53 of wearable article 115. Connectors 51 and 53 have wires 55 and 57, which terminate into a single electrical plug 89. Electrical plug 89 is releasably connected to electrical connection 91 of DEP 63. Wearable article 115 (which could be, for example, a headband or a hat) includes pocket 119 for retaining DEP 63. Pocket 119 has slot 123 and coiled wire 125 secured to one of the walls of pocket 119. Wire 125 terminates at plate 127, which is housed inside the pocket 119. Plate 127 is releasably connected, preferably with a hook and loop fastener system, to fastener 135 (which is also preferably a hook and loop fastener) of DEP 63. The preferred length of wires 101 and 105 is equal to or less than 15 cm, more preferably equal to or less than 12 cm in length, and most preferably equal to or less than 9 cm in length. Such system can be used in an electronic wearable cap in a similar manner as illustrated in FIG. 37, which shows another preferred embodiment. It is understood that a spring loaded spool with retractable wire can be replaced by a coiled wire with retracting capabilities without spring loaded mechanism. It is further understood that when a storage area is used, such as pocket, the wire can be straight and without retracting capabilities, with the wire remaining in a rolled up or folded position when stored and straight when use for placement on the ears. Alternatively, connector 91 may be connected with wire 125, and then the Velcro strip may use electrical pads for electrically connecting to electronic device, or plug 89 may use a coiled wire, so when coiled wire 125, which is used for support, extends, then coiled wire of plug 89 extends as well, maintaining thus electrical connection with ear buds during extension. One coiled wire is for electrical connection, and the other coiled wire is for support.
 FIG. 2A shows wearable electronics provided by the Prior Art when worn by a user. The weight distribution of the prior art will activate pain fibers in the neck, causing discomfort and limiting the utility of the devices. A relatively heavy electronic device such as computer or other electronic device 80 will elicit discomfort and prevent comfortable wear when the electronics, display, and other parts collectively gathered in box 82 are supported by collar 84 that encircles the neck. Even if there is an opening 84 a in collar 84, the prior art systems need to close that opening circle in order to be operational and was designed to be supported by the user's neck. This is because any time the two ends of a wrap-around system connect, for example forming a circle such as in collars around the neck, belts around the waist, or straps across the chest, and the like described in the prior art, there is a change in the vector force and more pressure is applied to a localized anatomic area, which can more readily activate pain fibers and elicit discomfort. The prior art, in order to keep the whole electronic system in one location, imposed significant pressure in one localized anatomic area. Therefore, pain receptors are activated based on the amount of pressure within this localized anatomic area, leading to discomfort when those devices of the prior art are used. While there is an apparent advantage, as provided by the prior art, in keeping the weight of the device in a localized anatomic area and covering a smaller surface area of contact with the body, this apparent advantage works against the biology of the body and inhibits comfortable use. Thus, the present invention further contemplates a wearable electronic device which distributes weight to different anatomic regions, increasing user comfort as compared to the prior art. Vector F in FIG. 2A represents the large amount of weight that is placed against the neck, and is the to total of the weight of the right and left side of the collar, represented by vectors F1 and F2. The resulting weight represented by vector F creates pressure in the sensitive neck area. Furthermore, by not creating proper weight distribution of the device on the user, which is very difficult when it is supported by a collar around the neck, there will be acceleration and motion of the device, which can create friction on the user and increases the user's discomfort in the neck area.
In order to provide a useful, practical, and comfortable wearable electronic device, a series of key criteria should be met, as is accomplished by present invention. First, it is important that the weight of the device be shifted to areas that are less sensitive to pain and discomfort. In accordance to one embodiment of the invention, weight is shifted for instance to the nose and to the shoulder.
Second, in order to be more easily used, the system needs to function like a conventional computer and include all parts of a conventional computer. In one embodiment of the present invention, the wearable electronic device includes all the components of a conventional computer including heavier and large items such as a keyboard. It also provides a keyboard that can be typed on with two hands and a display (or monitor) that provides large visual angles.
Third, to achieve proper weight distribution, the electronic parts should be disposed using two arms, spaced apart from each other. Fourth, the arms need to have a combination of flexible and extendable portions for conforming to the anatomy of the body and to position of the parts when in use, and to allow a compact spatial conformation when not in use. This makes wearing and use of the wearable electronic device more practical.
Fifth, to achieve stability and good weight distribution, the supporting structure may comprise a cord, which runs continuously from one end of the device to the other, and which holds the electronic components at the end of each arm. Sixth, the masses of each side of the device should be similar. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, this is achieved by disposing a keyboard one side and a display unit at the opposite side, the display unit and keyboard being of similar dimension and weight. Seventh, the wearable electronic needs to be stable while in use, for example while the user is typing. This may be accomplished by having a counter weight effect arising from a connection between the display unit and a power source.
Eighth, the weight of the wearable electronic device should not be placed in only one anatomic area in order to avoid localized pressure, which can more easily activate pain fibers. Thus, the weight of the wearable electronic device should be spread to different anatomic areas. For example, one embodiment of the present invention provides a wearable electronic device in which the weight is spread to four different anatomic areas: neck, shoulder, chest, and waist.
Ninth, the greatest part of the mass of the wearable electronic device (ordinarily represented by the electronics) should be disposed at the ends of an independent tube-like structure that rests directly against the body. This achieves a better balance between the two sides and conformability to the body. Tenth, in order to increase the utility of the unit, the wearable electronic should have the capability to be used when not worn on the body. Eleventh, the wearable electronic article will preferably not encircle, rest against, or put pressure on the neck area, ear area, and other sensitive areas of the body.
These principals are incorporated into the embodiment shown in FIG. 2B, which shows a diagrammatic representation of a preferred embodiment of the wearable electronic computer of the invention. FIG. 2B shows the weight distribution of a preferred embodiment of the present invention including inverted U-shape support structure 88 with arms 90 and 92. In another embodiment, the support structure can have an inverted V-shape. Arm 90 has keyboard 94 disposed at its end. Arm 92 has a display 96 disposed at its end. Therefore, support structure 88 covers three distinct anatomic areas: neck 93, shoulders 95, and chest 97. The weight is further distributed to a fourth anatomic area, by securing box 96âhousing a power source and electronicsâto the user's waist. Box 96 is connected to support structure 88 by cable 98. By having arms 90 and 92 spaced apart, there is less pressure on any one particular anatomic area, inhibiting the activation of pain receptors.
The inverted U-shaped support structure distributes the devices weight to multiple anatomic areas. It does this, from the physical stand point, as a cord connecting two masses (m1 and m2) exemplified in the invention by display 97 (m1) and a keyboard 94 (m2), with cord 93 running over a âpulley,â represented by the user's neck and shoulder. The forces in play are the downward force of gravity and the upward force due to the tension in the cord. Masses m1 and m2 should be similar to avoid acceleration, because acceleration would cause friction in the user's skin and activation of pain fibers. Therefore, the parts of the electronic device are disposed in a manner that the mass in one side of the cord is similar to the mass in the opposite side of cord 93. This creates equal or roughly equal tension in each side of cord 93. Vector G represents the distributed force in the right arm, which is divided into three components: vector G1 for the neck, vector G2 for the shoulder, and vector G3 for the chest. The same applies to vector H on the opposite side, represented by vectors H1 (neck), H2 (shoulder), and H3 (chest). Vector GH represents the pressure in the user's neck, and is much smaller than vector F of the prior art as shown in FIG. 2A. Vectors J1 and J2 represent the tension in cord 93 and vectors G and H are preferably approximately or precisely equal. Therefore no acceleration or friction is generated, allowing for comfortable use. Other benefits and features will become apparent from the description and figures pertaining to the related embodiments described in other portions of this specification. Although two arms are described, it is understood that three or more arms can also be used and provide good weight distribution and proper design, as in accordance to the teachings of the invention.
The pain threshold in the neck is generally in the range of 40 to 70 g/mm sup.2; in the shoulder and adjacent areas, the pain threshold is generally in the range of 60 to 100 g/mm sup.2. Pain receptors are typically not activated until the pressure reaches those limits, and therefore the weight of the wearable electronics of the invention takes this into account to provide comfortable wear. In addition to its weight distribution, the absolute maximum weight supported by the anatomic area is important to prevent activation of pain fibers. Based on the pressure and pain threshold in the neck, shoulder, and chest, the present invention provides proper weight, weight distribution, and design of the structure of the wearable device to allow comfort and long term use of the wearable electronic device.
By way of illustration, but not of limitation, an illustrative preferred embodiment will is described: This embodiment of the wearable electronic system of the invention comprises an inverted U-shaped support structure measuring preferably 60 cm in length in its non-extended configuration. It combines an extendable portion, preferably using a spinal configuration, and a flexible gooseneck portion. The support structure has a surface area in contact with the user of approximately 1 cm.sup.2 per centimeter of length. This provides for approximately 600 cm.sup.2 of the support structure in contact with the user, equally divided among neck, shoulder and chest. The device provides for a preferred maximum weight of 700 grams on each arm of the support structure (1400 g total), which can be supported in the neck and shoulder/chest area in a comfortable manner without activating pain fibers. Although each arm can support 850 grams, preferably, the maximum weight for comfortable wear on each arm of the support structure is equal to or less than 650 grams, and most preferably equal to or less than 500 grams, minimizing activation of pain fibers in the user.
Although the invention can function solely with all of the components supported on the inverted-U support structure, in order to optimize weight distribution, the invention can also spread the weight to areas in the body that are biomechanically fit to hold a larger amount of weight, such as the waist area. Accordingly, the support structure can be connected by a connecting cord to a housing supported on the user's waist. Heavier parts such as a power source, mother board, hard drive, DVD player/writer, and other computer parts are preferably displaced to the waist area, and held in place preferably by a belt clip or other fastening means to the waist area of the body.

It is understood that one of the methods of the invention includes the step of replacing conventional temples of eyeglasses by the wired temples of the invention. This allows the user to keep the original lenses and lens rim of conventional eyeglasses, and just replace the temple with similarly looking temples as the original. With the temples of the invention the original eyeglasses with the original lenses and lens rims are now enabled to perform an electronic function.
 FIG. 29. shows an exemplary DEP. It is understood that any article having the capability of performing a function including powering a light source, playing music, receiving a wireless signal, playing video, voice recording, video recording, receiving and/or transmitting an internet signal, and the like is within the scope of the invention and can function as the electronic package of DEP with said article having electrical connections for releasably connecting with the frame of eyeglasses. Although powering a light source is an electrical function, for the purposes of the description, any electrical function is described as a function performed by the Detachable Electronic Package or DEP. Furthermore, electronic package of DEP can include digital player for music and video, a small CD player, and a camera with SD card port for extra storage in the DEP. Function of DEP also include system for measuring biological parameter, and by way of illustration DEP can be adapted to measure glucose levels, temperature, eye pressure, blood pressure, oxygen, blood flow, or any other physical parameter or chemical substance present in the body. Again, by way of illustration, the electronic package of DEP is connected to a sensor secured to the eyeglasses in accordance to the sensing eyeglasses invented by Abreu and described in US Patent application 20040059212 and 20040242976, in which the wireless transmitter is removed from the front part of the eyeglasses and place as a DEP in the back of the head, or alternatively the electronic package of DEP measures chemical substances such as glucose as a stand alone unit. An eyeglasses with tubes next to the nose to measure oxygen can have the electronics for processing the data and display housed away in the DEP.
The apparatus and method of the invention allows a system that performs an electric or electronic function to be divided between DEP and the frame of eyeglasses, allowing therefore better weight distribution while allowing a wearable article such as eyeglasses to be capable of performing a second function besides visual function. Accordingly, DEP can include only a power source that powers a fan, heater, or Peltier device housed in the frame of the eyeglasses for heating and cooling the user. In this embodiment, the eyeglasses do not have an ear bud, with said eyeglasses having only a small fan for cooling purposes and an electrical connection for connecting with the DEP working as a power source for the fan. DEP can further function as a remote control, a wireless receiver for receiving a television signal, and a speaker. In addition, the invention allows hearing aids to be miniaturized since the power source and/or other electronics are located in the DEP and the small single hearing element is housed at the end of the temple of the eyeglasses. A variety of hearing aids and other devices can be made extremely small, in accordance to the invention, by housing part of the device in the DEP, and part in the head mounted gear such as eyeglasses. Thus making the head mounted gear more comfortable and with multiple electronic functions. The ear buds of the eyeglasses can work as insulators from exterior noises while receiving sound from a digital music player, with part of the electronics and/or power source stored in the DEP away from the frames.
Although the preferred embodiment includes both right and left temples, having electrical connections and wires, it is understood that only one temple of the eyeglasses can have an electrical connection, with said electrical connection releasably connected to a wire from DEP.

It will be understood that cable 1279 can be covered by a cord that is permanently affixed to pouch 1263.
The present invention also provides an entirely new approach for Bluetooth-type headset devices. (By âBluetooth deviceâ or âBluetooth-type deviceâ I mean devices which attach to the user's ear and communicate wirelessly with other electronic devices using Bluetooth communication protocols or other communications protocols.) Prior art wrap-around ear Bluetooth devices have the wrap-around arm on the Bluetooth device which competes for the same space on the ear as the end of the eyeglass temples. Thus people who wear eyeglasses have two hard items around the ear, making this practice uncomfortable, sometimes painful, and often ineffective with respect to securing the Bluetooth device to the ear. This embodiment of the present invention offers key advantages for people who wear eyeglasses on a regular basis and want to use a Bluetooth device. With the invention, the temple of the eyeglasses are the only piece which needs to rest on the ear, while the Bluetooth device or other wireless device provides additional benefits to the user without requiring added hardware pressing against the head and ear. The Bluetooth device of the present invention shifts weight away from a very sensitive part of the body, the ears, and not even require any part of the device to press against the delicate and thin skin around the ears.
 FIG. 34C shows prior art Bluetooth device 1461. Bluetooth device 1461 comprises ear support piece 1467, microphone 1465, and speaker 1463 (or any other device for transmitting sound. Speaker 1463 receives audio signal from a second device, such as a cell phone. Speaker 1463 is physically integrated into device 1461 and adapted to fit in the ear canal. Such devices are sold, for example by the Nokia Company of Finland and Motorola, Inc. of the United States. None of the known Bluetooth devices have a separate electrical connector for an ear bud, since they were designed to be held by the ear, and were able to generates sound without any external wires.
The present invention provides an improved Bluetooth device as shown in FIG. 34D. Device 1475 has external speaker (or ear bud) 1471 and external wire 1471 a for transmitting audio signal (from a cell phone, for example) to the ear of the user. Specialized Bluetooth device 1475 has housing 1493 and two speaker assemblies for emitting sound: internal speaker 1469 which is physically integrated in housing 1493, and external speaker 1471 which is connected to housing 1493 through electrical connector 1477. This allows external speaker 1471 to be positioned in a location remote from housing 1493. External wire 1471 a outside housing 1493 is connected to a single external speaker (ear bud) 1471, forming external speaker assembly 1473. External speaker assembly 1473 is preferably removably connected to device 1475 through female connector 1477. It is understood that assembly 1473 can also be permanently affixed to housing 1493. Both external speaker assembly 1473 and internal speaker 1469 connect to Bluetooth wireless communications system 1481. Wire 1483 connects external speaker assembly 1473 and electrical connector 1477 in housing 1493 to Bluetooth wireless communications system 1481. Wire 1485 connects internal speaker 1469 in housing 1493 to Bluetooth wireless communications system 1481. Bluetooth wireless communications system 1481 contains a power source and all parts necessary for a 2-way wireless Bluetooth transmission of data. Specialized Bluetooth device 1475 further includes removably connected microphone assembly 1487, comprising stalk 1489 for transmitting sound and a microphone 1491. It is understood that microphone stalk 1489 can also be permanently affixed to housing 1493. Stalk 1489 can work as a voice tube, with its distal end connected to housing 1493 through connector 1501, which in turn is connected to Bluetooth wireless communications system 1481 through wire 1495.
Specialized Bluetooth device 1475 can be adapted to as an ear-supported device. Accordingly, housing 1493 further includes opening 1497 for receiving ear support assembly 1499. Therefore, specialized Bluetooth device 1475 can be an ear supported device (like, in some respects, prior art devices), which can create more discomfort by activating pain fibers of the sensitive anatomic region of the ear, or as a more comfortable and biologically fit device which does do not apply pressure directly against the ear. Because microphone assembly 1487 is removable and interchangeable with other devices, an assembly of different size and format can be used when device 1475 is supported by the ear using ear support assembly 1499. In an ear supported application, ear bud 1471 is disconnected from housing 1493, and a shorter stalk 1489 for microphone assembly 1487 is preferably used. Alternatively, device 1475 can be attached to the temple of a user's eyeglasses using one of the attachment mechanisms described in connection with FIGS. 19-21, or other attachment mechanisms.

Extendable wire portion 1869 is disposed in an accordion configuration or any other stretchable configuration, and is adapted to match the tensile strength and length of elastic strap 1871, allowing elastic strap 1871 to be stretched without creating undue tension in wire 1869. Wire portion 1859 terminates in extendable wire portion 1869, and wire portion 1869 terminates in wire portion 1873 inside back portion 1875. Back portion 1875 includes pouch 1877 for retaining an electronics package (not shown). Pouch 1877 is essentially similar to the pockets of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 37 and 37A. Ear bud 1881 and coiled wire 1879 are shown inside pocket 1883 of right strap 1845.
The wearable electronic articles of the invention, illustratively represented by eyeglasses and hats, can include imaging systems as shown in FIG. 35. The wearable articles, such as the eyeglasses and hat, offer an added benefit of assisting in identifying an assailant. A person wearing the detachable electronic camera eyeglasses can have an image of the face of a potential assailant. Even if the assailant takes away or break the eyeglasses, since the image is immediately transmitted (either to the DEP or wirelessly) to a remote location, the face of assailant would have been captured. This may act as a deterrent against crime since potential assailants would not know if they were being filmed or were filmed during an attack. Since the invention requires only the micro optical system to be housed in the frame, children also can also use the system. Children can only wear small frames, which would be impossible to fit with a camera. Since the eyeglasses of the invention only hold the micro optical system which is small in size, they can be easily housed in the small frames worn by children. In the case of a DEP being worn as a detachable electronic cap, a DEP comprising a camera is preferably located on the side, with the pouch for the DEP preferably located on the side of the hat, and not on the back, thereby allowing easier viewing and filming.
Since the invention allows the camera to be extremely small, the frame can have multiple micro optical systems, such as one facing the back of the user and another facing the front of the user, allowing thus identifying an assailant coming from any direction. The system can therefore identify an assailant and even prevent a rape or kidnapping, or any crime. If an assailant saw the DEP, which is more visible, the assailant still would not know if the user has wireless camera capabilities. It is thus preferred to have electronics packages that do not identify the function being performed, to avoid an external observer to know if the user has a DEP with Bluetooth capabilities, MP3 capabilities, or wireless camera capabilities. A DEP with wireless camera capabilities and GPS capabilities would inform the location of the user as well as the image being recorded. Although a wireless camera can transmit images continuously, the only expense and work the user has is related to keeping a charged battery in the DEP. If the user prefers only to record in certain occasions, the DEP can have a voice activated system for initiating recording only when requested by the user. As such, a code word such as âactionâ or ârecordâ can be used for activating the wireless camera. This function would help preserve power, and would be of interest for instance, by a camper recording a certain trail or scenery, or a person being followed recording a possible assailant. When there is suspicious activity, the user can give a voice command to activate the camera, or can press an activation button in the DEP.
 FIG. 38 shows another embodiment of the invention. Detachable electronic shirt system 1450 is worn by user 1451 (depicted in phantom lines) and comprises DEP 1460 and detachable electronic shirt 1470. Left side of collar 1472 is shown in a lifted position to illustrate pouch 1464 on the inside face of the fabric of collar 1472 for retaining ear bud 1476 and spool 1478. Wire portion 1474 extends for positioning ear bud 1476 on ear 1475. On the right side, wire portion 1484 is connected to DEP 1460. Wire 1484 is in an extended position to enable viewing of the display of electronics package 1480. Pouch 1462 on the right side of collar 1472 is shown in a sealed position. Cavity spool 1498 and ear bud 1496 are retained inside pouch 1462.
To use this embodiment of the invention, the user lifts the free end of collar 1472 to expose pouch 1464, and then extends wire portion 1474 to position ear bud 1476 on ear 1475. Likewise, upon pulling wire portion 1484, electronics package 1480 is removed from pouch 1486 and positioned in line with the visual axis of the eyes 1481, as shown by arrow B. Wire portion 1484 has male plug 1488, which is connected to female plug 1492 of electronic package 1480. Wire portion 1500, secured to spool 1498, exits collar 1472 and enters chest portion 1502 of shirt 1470 for connecting with spool 1482. Left wire portion 1504 is secured to spool 1478 and disposed on collar 1472. Left wire portion 1504 is disposed on collar 1472 from the left side to the right side and terminates at spool 1482, after joining right wire portion 1500 to form cable 1506.
In this embodiment, in order to facilitate manufacturing, pouches 1462 and 1464 retain both spool and ear bud, while pouch 1486 retains both DEP and spool. Although pouch 1486 is disposed on the front part of shirt, pouch 1486 can alternatively be disposed on collar 1472 or on the back part of the shirt in close proximity to collar.
Although this embodiment uses retractable wires and spools, it will be understood that robotic arms, telescopic assemblies, or the like can be used instead of the retractable wire/spool system for extending ear buds and electrical plugs. It will also be understood that Velcro fasteners can be used to attach the DEP and ear buds to the wearable article, such as the cap and shirt, instead of using pouches.
Although only a few exemplary embodiments were described in detail, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention can be modified to accommodate other wearable articles. A variety of wearable articles can be used, in accordance with the invention, including clothing in general (such as ties, jackets, snow hat, arm band, etc.), head mounted gear (such as goggles, visors, head bands, wrap around ear assembly, helmets, silicon caps for swimmers, eye masks for sleeping, etc.), and personal items (such as wallet, cases of eyeglasses clipped to a shirt or pants, etc.), allowing thus the user to have access to electronic functionality using a variety of articles. By way of illustration, detachable electronically-enabled goggles according to the invention, such as ski goggles or swimming goggles, include a pouch in the back portion of the strap which retains the spool and DEP, and one pouch on each side of the strap for retaining a spool and ear bud in conjunction with the other features of the invention.
Virtual imaging eyewear, digital imaging eyewear, and infrared imaging eyewear can, in accordance with the invention, be made light weight and without wires, with only the optics and silicon microdisplay being in front of the eye, while the electronics and smart parts are housed in the DEP in a detachable manner and away from the front portion of the eyewear. Accordingly, a virtual imaging eyewear, in accordance to the invention, allows complete portability with no wires attached to the eyewear when playing a game, as found in the prior art. With the present invention, the display is disposed in the front part of the eyewear for viewing the game, with a DEP working as a retractable game control housed at the back of the head. When in use, the extendable cord is extended, allowing the game control to be brought into the user's view. After the game is finished, the extendable cord is retracted, and the game control is stored in the cradle-like housing of the DEP.
Because the present invention allows a cost-effective way to electronically enable an article, it will be also apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the present invention to use it in conjunction with non-wearable articles. For example, a back pack can be adapted with a detachable system according to the invention, preferably in its upper part because of its proximity to the eyes and ear of the user, and providing therefore sound and electronic function in a hands-free manner Other examples of articles which can be electronically enabled are pillows, head rest of arm chairs, desks, etc. In such articles, the articles houses the DEP, ear buds and other assemblies of the present invention, allowing the user to remove the DEP from a hat and plug the same DEP into the desk while working. The DEP can be attached to the article using a pair of âarmsâ shaped like the temples of eyeglasses attached to the article. The arms can be permanently affixed to the article, or they can be removable, allowing the same set of arms to be used on multiple items, for example a desk, or the fold down tray on a airplane. Alternatively, the DEP can be attached to the article using Velcro strips, or a series of snaps or buttons, or a hook and groove system. The means of attachment is not critical, but can be chosen to accommodate various need (eg., ease of removal, stability of attachment, etc. A variety of furniture in close proximity to the head can also be adapted to receive the system of the invention such as head board of a bed. It is also understood and apparent to one of skill in the art that other articles such as a bicycle, a treadmill, and other articles can advantageously receive the detachable system and assemblies of the present invention.
It will also be understood that a retractable wire and spool can be attached to the electronics package such as a music player, allowing the electronics package to be moved to the user's visual axis and replaced without undue risk of dropping it. However, such a retractable wire is not required for the invention.
It is understood that a variety of head gear, clothing, and footwear can be used in accordance with the principles of the invention. For instance, clothing can house ear buds and electrical connectors, which can be releasably connected to a DEP, with said DEP being located anywhere in a piece of clothing on the body, but away from the gear housing the ear buds. In one embodiment, the ear buds and wire are preferably housed in a water-proof housing in the collar. A two DEP system can also be used, in which a DEP secured to a piece of footwear sends a wireless signal to a DEP secured to a cap or eyeglasses, allowing thus information such as foot activity, temperature or circulation to be transmitted to a second DEP adapted to inform the user or display the data being received from the DEP in the footwear.
Another embodiment includes a helmet (such as a bike helmet or a firefighter's helmet) with ear buds, wire and electrical connections permanently housed in the helmet. In one embodiment of a detachable electronic helmet system, the DEP preferably houses a wireless communication system for communicating instructions for instance between a fire chief and a firefighter or between a coach and an athlete. The invention provides an extremely cost-effective system since the low cost parts such as the ear bud, wire and electrical plug are preferably permanently housed in the head mounted gear such as the helmet while the expensive parts are housed in the DEP. Because the expensive parts are detachable, the firefighter or athlete can remove the DEP from the helmet which was used for receiving instructions during work, and now said firefighter or athlete can connect the DEP to their sunglasses and receive a wireless signal for instance from a satellite radio station for enjoying music while wearing sunglasses that only house low cost parts. Thus the invention provides another unique benefit, which is equal use of the invention for work and for entertainment. The invention also allows maximizing the use of a device, for example by avoiding an expensive wireless system to sit idle for a long time. By being versatile the invention allows continue use of the electronic package in any occasion. Otherwise, the wireless capabilities only would be available when wearing the helmet in question, significantly limiting therefore the use of the device. The invention thus provides methods such as for miniaturizing devices in wearable articles by reducing the parts disposed in the wearable article and to maximize use of the devices.
Of course, it is also possible to permanently house the entire system in the helmet, particularly when the electronics device might be specialized (e.g. for a fire helmet), or when the user might not want to wear anything other than the helmet. For example, a biker could have the device built into her bike helmet, allowing her to listen to music whilst biking. By pulling the device out from the storage compartment on the helmetâby using the retractable cordâthe user could see the device to make music selections, for example, and could then let the cord pull the device back to the storage compartment, allowing for hands-free use.
The invention also teaches and provides significant improvements to prior art eyeglasses which house heavy electronics and unsightly ear buds on a permanent basis. It does s by permitting visual interaction with the electronic components. By using the retractable wire assembly and cradle-like housing described in FIGS. 1D and 1E, the electronic and a display can be brought to the visual axis of the eye of the user.
It will be that in order to avoid having wires passing through a hinge mechanism, (for example when a display is housed in the lens rim, as illustrated in FIG. 13) the invention preferably uses an electrical connection in the temples that includes an electromagnetic switch. An example of such a switch is the Reed switch, described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040059212 and 20040242976. A slip-on display can be also be used, with the display being electrically connected with the frame of the eyeglasses, and the eyeglasses being connected to a DEP.
It is also understood that a variety of devices for measuring biological parameters such as contact lenses, devices inside the eye, or on the surface of the eye, and many other devices and sensors described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,544,193 and in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040059212 and 20040242976âthe disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by referenceâcan be used in accordance to the present invention. Accordingly, a device described in one of the foregoing patents or patent applications can have its parts divided between the original device and the DEP. This limits the number of electronic parts housed in the eyeglasses.
It will also be understood that eyeglasses that house a coil to power another device by electromagnetic induction, such as a passive contact lens described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,544,193, can be used in accordance with the present invention. The lens rim can house the coils, with the power source being housed in the DEP. It will be further understood in certain functions characterized by a large or heavy DEP, small batteries can be housed in the temples of the eyeglasses, with the main electronics and hard drive housed in a DEP.
The invention can also include adhesive or attachment means to secure the DEP to clothing, which is preferably used in case of heavy DEP. For example, a DEP of eyeglasses having a hook-and-loop strip (Velcro) can be attached to a Velcro in the collar of a shirt reducing therefore the amount of weight applied to the eyeglasses.
Other gear can also be used in accordance to the invention, including any of the head mounted gear described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040059212 and 20040242976. For example, a detachable electronic eye mask from the foregoing applications may be worn by a user who plugs it into a DEP comprising of digital music player. The user may then enjoy music while laying on the beach and having his/her eyes covered and protected. When the user is in bed, he or she can still enjoy music wearing the eye mask of the invention, but before falling asleep can unplug the DEP, removing a heavier piece which can limit comfort during sleep.
The present invention also provides a system that includes another wearable article such as shoulder supported housing and a generally C-shaped structure with a cavity sized to accept an electronic package such as a cellular telephone, a digital music player (e.g., MP3 player), a video player, and the like,
 FIG. 39 shows a wearable electronic device 1550 worn on the shoulder of a user (shown drawn in phantom lines). Shoulder wearable electronic device 1550 preferably includes generally âCâ-shaped (or Inverted U-shape) housing 1560. Preferably, the C-shaped housing covers at least 180 degrees. Opening 1552 is sized to permit housing 1560 to pass around neck 1554 (or other body portion) of a user. Opening 1552 distributes the weight of electronic device 1550 between the shoulder and the neck. Preferably, the C-shaped housing is adapted to remain at least 2.5 cm from the side of neck, reducing the likelihood of activating of pain fibers and limiting discomfort. C-shaped housing 1560 fits comfortably around a small portion of the user's neck, and is preferably held in place on the surface of the body by gravity and support of a body part, and not by straps or other fastening means.
In a preferred embodiment, housing 1560 is formed of a polymeric material and includes cavity 1555 for retaining electronics package 1556, in a similar manner as described in connection with FIGS. 2B and 2C. Retractable wire 1558 and spool 1562 are connected to electronics package 1556. Ear buds 1562 and 1564 are disposed in a diametrically opposed fashion at the right and left side of housing 1560 and are connected by wires 1566 and 1568 to spools 1570 and 1572, speaker 1588. Microphone 1574 is disposed at end 1576 of housing 1560; display 1578 is disposed at opposite end 1580 of housing 1560. A coiled wire with retracting capabilities can also be used instead of retractable wires with spools, and in this embodiment shown in FIG. 39, there are no spools.
Housing 1560 also includes power source 1582, which is preferably located adjacent to cavity 1555 and held in the back portion of housing 1560. To facilitate illustration cavity 1555 and electronics package 1556 are shown in the back portion of housing 1560; however it is understood they may be disposed on either side of the housing 1560, or they can be disposed on opposite sides. Electronics package 1556, such as a cell phone, is releasably secured in the cavity 1555 through electrical connector 1590. Electrical connector 1590 is connected to spool 1562. Electronics package 1556 is connected by a wire system that includes a spool and retractable wires or by coiled cords or a combination of coiled cords and spool-based cords, to ear buds in accordance to previous description of the invention. It will be appreciated that the various parts disposed within or on housing 1560, such as ear buds, microphone, speaker, electronic circuit, display, power source, and the electronics package are electrically connected by standard wiring systems, which are not shown.
When the device is worn, the microphone is in close proximity to the mouth, and the display is within the visual axis of the eyes to permit, for example seeing a caller ID number. Housing 1560 preferably includes hinge assemblies 1608 and 1610, to allow arms 1612 and 1614 to fold upon each other. This facilitates storage of the device by reducing its size by about two thirds.
Although a C-shaped structure has been described as the preferred embodiment, other shapes, such as square shapes, pentagonal shapes, or other polygonal shapes, can be used, without departing from the scope of the invention. Preferably, the largest width (or height) of cavity 1555 or housing 1560 is equal to or less than 15 cm, and most preferably equal to or less than 11 cm, and even most preferably equal to or less than 7 cm. The preferred longest distance of the center point of the support structure (illustrated herein as C-shaped structure) to the outer edge of the support structure is equal to or less than 28 cm, and preferably equal to or less than 20 cm, and even preferably equal to or less than 13 cm, The preferred shortest distance of the center point of the support structure (illustrated herein as C-shaped structure) to the outer edge of the support structure is equal to or more than 9 cm, and preferably equal to or more than 11 cm, and even preferably equal to or more than 13 cm, The structure comprises an opening, and disposed within the structure an ear bud, wires, and a cavity sized to accept an electronic package.
 FIG. 39A shows an embodiment of similar to the embodiment of FIG. 39, with two additional parts: large video display 1592 attached to housing 1560 by telescopic and retractable/extendable arm 1594, and removable cord 1596. The electronics package in this embodiment is video player 1595, which is positioned in cavity 1555 and connected by electrical connector 1590. The detachable electronic system can be operable from a motor vehicle 12 VDC cigarette plug accessory voltage or AC outlet through cord 1596, and can charge electronics package 1595 when not in use.
It is understood that housing 1560 can house a plurality of electronic devices, for example a cellular phone/MP3 player on the right side and an electronic organizer (such as a Palm device from Palm, Inc.) on the left side. Likewise, a radio or other electronic devices described in the present invention can be housed in structure 1560 and creates an anatomically fit wearable electronic article in accordance to the principles of the invention.
 FIG. 39B shows an embodiment in which electronics package 1556, exemplified as a cellular phone or cordless phone, is not electrically attached to housing 1560. Electronics package 1556 is shown away from housing 1560. In this embodiment, electronics package 1556 can be mechanically retained in cavity 1555 by release button 1598. Electronics package 1556 communicates by wireless means with housing 1560. In a preferred embodiment, electrical pads 1600 disposed in cavity 1555 are coupled to a power supply in housing 1560 and permit recharging the internal battery within electronic package 1556. Electrical pads 1600 are sized and positioned to contact associated electrical pads (not shown) on electronics package 1556. The main electronics, power supply, long range receiver/transmitter for cellular phones, and heavier and large circuits (collectively called main parts 1602) are housed in housing 1560, allowing the hand held portion of the cellular phone (or cordless phone) to be miniaturized, with only a small thin battery and a small low power transmitter/receiver microchip circuit for short range transmissions being housed in the hand held portion. By having only few and very small parts, for example thin dial pad 1620, display 1622, built-in microphone 1624 and speaker 1626, electronics package 1556 can have small dimensions such as a credit card or small calculator, as shown in FIG. 39B, and be carried in a wallet. Because housing 1560 is preferably foldable, housing 1560 can carried in a brief case or pocket of a jacket while remaining in wireless communication with the credit card-like cell phone of the invention.
The same benefit applies to a DEP housed in eyeglasses or other head mounted gear such as a hat, etc., allowing the user to carry a credit card like cellular phone while the main parts of the cellular phone are hidden away out of sight and comfortably stored in an article already being worn by the user, enhancing the utility of that wearable article.

Likewise the connecting arm between right and left arm by touching the body can work as an electrical circuit, and thus no wires connecting right and left arm are necessary.
 FIG. 61 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. Storage cord 3000 comprises sleeves 3001 and 3002, ear buds 3003 and 3004, and electronics package 3005. As described previously in connection with other embodiments, electronics package 3005 is electrically connected to ear buds 3003 and 3004. Electronics package 3005 is also optionally connected to storage cord 3000 using a retractable cord (not shown). When electronics package 3005 is moved from its position on storage cord 3000 so that it can be brought into the user's visual axis, it remains loosely attached to storage cord 3000 with the retractable cord. This facilitates replacement of electronics package 3005 onto storage cord 3000. Preferably, movement of electronics package 3005 relative to storage cord 3000 does not result in movement of wires 3006 and 3007âconnecting ear buds 3003 and 3002ârelative to storage cord 3000. That is, wires 3006 and 3007 are anchored onto storage cord 3000. Therefore, when electronics package 3005 is moved (whether or not it is attached with a retractable cord), the ear buds will not be pulled from the user's ears.
Sleeves 3001 and 3002 are preferably made of an elastomeric materialâsuch as rubber or neopreneâso that they can be removably, but securely attached, to the temples of a pair of eyeglasses. Openings 3008 and 3009 are sized so that they will fit snugly onto eyeglass temples, and preferably will be from 2 mm to 15 mm in diameter, more preferably between 5 and 12 mm. In one preferred embodiment, storage cord 3000 will be attached to a pair of eyeglasses. Alternatively, as will be described in more detail below, openings 3008 and 3009 can be attached to temple-like appendages located on other wearable articles, such as hats, or other objects, such as walls, or airline food trays.
 FIG. 62 shows storage cord 3000 of FIG. 61 as it is about to be worn by user 3010. User 3010 is wearing eyeglasses 3011, which have temple 3012. Storage cord 3000 is positioned so that opening 3008 of sleeve 3002 is poised to slip over the end of temple 3012.
 FIG. 63 shows storage cord 3000 of FIG. 61 being worn and used by user 3010. Sleeve 3002 has been attached to temple 3012, holding storage cord 3000 in place behind the head of user 3010. Ear bud 3004 has been positioned over ear 3013, allowing user 3010 to hear sound transmitted from electronics package 3005.

Storage cord 3030 comprises sleeves 3031 and 3032, ear buds 3033 and 3034, and electronics package 3035. Storage cord 3030 further comprises storage pockets 3036 and 3037, which are used for storing ear buds 3033 and 3034. It will be understood that sleeves 3031 and 3032 need not be made of the same material as main body 3038 of storage cord 3030, though they can be. For example, main body 3038 might be made of leather, while sleeves 3031 and 3032 could be made of neoprene.
 FIG. 66 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, storage cord 3040 is made of two materials. Sleeves 3041 and 3042 are made of a elastomeric material, such as neoprene or rubber. Main body 3043 is made of metal, which gives storage cord 3040 a more formal appearance, making it suitable for use while wearing formal attire. Ear buds 3044 and 3045âwhich are electrically connected with electronics package 3048âare retained in spools 3046 and 3047, which are permanently attached to storage cord 3040, preferably partially on sleeves 3041 and 3042 and partially on main body 3043. It will be understood that in this embodiment, as in other embodiments, the ear buds may be connected to the storage cord with articulated arms, rather than wires.
 FIG. 67 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. Like the embodiment of FIG. 66, storage cord 3050 is made of two materials. Sleeves 3051 and 3052âmade of an elastomeric materialâand main body 3053âmade of metalâare joined by joining pieces 3054 and 3055. Articulated arms 3056 and 3057 are electrically connected to electronics package 3058. Ear buds 3059 and 3060 are removably, electrically connected to articulated arms 3056 and 3057. Thus, when not in use, the ear buds can be removed from the storage cord, and therefore be kept out of sight.
 FIG. 68 shows the construction of a portion of a storage cord according to the invention. Storage cord 3061 is made of a single piece of neoprene 3062. Sleeves 3063 and 3064 are made by sewing together the edges of neoprene 3062 with stitches 3065. Electronics package 3066 is secured on the portion of neoprene 3062 which is not sewn together. Thus, stitches 3065 and electronics package 3066 are on the same side of neoprene 3062. Therefore, when storage cord 3061 is worn by a user, both electronics package 3066 and stitches 3065 face away from the user's skin, minimizing any discomfort felt by the user. Storage cord 3061 does not show any ear buds.
 FIG. 69 shows a portion of the storage cord of FIG. 68. Ear bud 3067 is electrically connected to electronics package 3066 by wire 3069. Ear bud 3067 is stored by pushing it partially inside hollow sleeve 3063. Microphone 3068 is connected to wire 3069, so that when ear bud 3067 is placed in the user's ear, microphone 3068 can pick up the user's voice and transmit it to electronics package 3066 (in this case, a cell phone).
 FIG. 70 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, the electronics package (not shown) is secured in pocket 3070 of storage cord 3071. Pocket 3070 is closed by flap 3072, which is secured by buttons 3073 and 3074. Once the electronics package is placed into pocket 3070, it is electrically connected to ear buds 3075 and 3076 by wires 3077 and 3078. Wires 3077 and 3078 run from ear buds 3075 and 3076 through spool 3079, where they are electrically connected to wire 3080. Wire 3080 runs from spool 3079 through electrical connector 3081, which is connected to the electronics package. Storage cord 3071 may be connected to a pair of eyeglasses (or temple-like connectors) using sleeves 3082 and 3083.
 FIG. 71 shows an embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention which is similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 70. The difference is that storage cord 3084 is attached to a wearable article by attaching snaps 3085 and 3086 to complementary snaps on the wearable article. The wearable article might be, for instance, a hat, or a jacket. Alternatively, snaps 3085 and 3086 can be attached to complementary snaps on another article, such as airline tray, or a wall. In this embodiment, storage cord 3084 does not have sleeves for attaching to a pair of eyeglasses.
 FIG. 72 shows a schematic diagram for a storage frame according to the invention. Storage frame 3090 comprises structure 3091 and spool holder 3097. Spool 3092 is located inside spool holder 3097, and holds wire 3093. Wire 3093 terminates in connector 3094, which is adapted to connect to an electronics package (not shown). Connector 3094 can be either an electrical connector or simply a mechanical connector. Spool 3092 can also hold wires connected to ear buds. Structure 3090 is shaped to receive an electronics package, with the top edges of the electronics package sliding under rims 3095. Electrical connector 3094 plugs into an electronics package. Stabilization pin 3096 is adapted to fit into a hole in the electronics package, and helps stabilize the electronics package in structure 3090. In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 73a , the electronics package is electrically connected to ear buds (not shown) through spool 3092. In another embodiment, the connection is only mechanical, with sound or data being transmitted wirelessly from the electronics package.
Storage frame 3090 is attached to a storage cord according to the invention. When the user wishes to look at the electronics package, he or she can slide it out of structure 3091 and bring it within his or her sight, with wire 3093 being extended from spool 3092 to maintain contact with the electronics package. When spool 3092 retracts, it pulls the electronics package back into structure 3091.
This is illustrated in FIG. 73a , in which electronics package 3098 is electrically connected to storage frame 3090 through connector 3094. Ear buds 3099 and 3100 are connected by wires 3101 and 3102 to printed circuit board 3103. A wire from printed circuit board to spool 3092 allows ear buds 3099 and 3100 to be electrically connected to electronics package 3098, via wires 3101 and 3102, printed circuit board 3103, wire 3104, spool 3092, wire 3093 and connector 3094. Stabilization pin 3096 is inserted into cavity 3105 of electronics package 3098.
 FIG. 73b  shows the embodiment of FIG. 73a , except that electronics package 3098 has been pulled out of storage frame 3090. As electronics package 3098 is pulled away from storage frame 3090, wire 3193 is pulled out from spool 3092. However, because wires 3101 and 3102 are anchored by printed circuit board 3103, ear buds 3099 and 3100 are not pulled from the user's ears.
 FIG. 74a  shows an alternative embodiment of a storage frame according to the invention. In this embodiment, electronics package 3106 is electrically and mechanically connected to storage frame 3107 by connector 3108. Connector 3108 is connected to ear buds 3109 and 3110 via coiled wire 3113, printed circuit board 3114, and wires 3111 and 3112.
When electronics package 3106 is pulled away from storage frame 3107, as shown in FIG. 74b , coiled wire 3113 uncoils (extends). However, printed circuit board 3114 anchors wires 3111 and 3112, so that they do not pull away ear buds 3109 and 3110 from the user's ears.
When an electronics package is pulled away from a storage cord according to the invention, tension can be placed on the retractable wire connecting it to the storage cord. This means there is a risk that the retractable wire might pull the connector plug out of the electronics package. Therefore, it will be helpful to have a means for securing the connector in the electronics package. FIG. 75a  shows connector stabilizer 3115, which is cross-shaped, and has clip 3116 for securing connector pin 3117 from a storage cord according to the invention. Arms 3118, 3119, 3120, and 3121 of stabilizer 3115 are secured to the sides of electronics package. This is illustrated in FIG. 75b , where the edge of electronics package 3122 is secured by arm 3123. In one embodiment, the dimensions of connector stabilizer 3115 can be varied so that it can be secured to electronics packages of varying dimensions. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the cross-shape of connector stabilizer 3115 is only a preferred embodiment; other shapes are also possible, with the only requirement being that the device be securable to an electronics package and be capable of securing a connection pin. FIG. 75d  shows more details of a clip which is part of connector stabilizer 3125. Holder arms 3116 a embrace connector 3126.
 FIG. 75c  shows electronics package 3124 attached to connector stabilizer 3125, which secures connector 3126 to electronics package 3124. Connector 3126 is attached to spool 3127 by wire 3128. Connector stabilizer 3125 prevents the tension in wire 3128 from pulling connector 3126 out of electronics package 3124.
An alternative embodiment of a connector stabilizer is shown in FIG. 76. FIG. 76 shows spool housing 3129 and structure 3130. Spool 3131 contains wire 3132, which is connected to connector 3133, which is shown plugged into electronics package 3134. Stabilizing loop 3135 is placed around connector 3133. Stabilizing loop 3135, shown in more detail in FIG. 76a , has a small hook 3136, which is used to hook into loop 3137 on electronics package 3134. When properly attached, stabilizing loop 3135 and loop 3137 will absorb the tension in wire 3132, preventing connector 3133 from pulling out of electronics package 3134. It will be understood that other means for stabilizing the connection between the connector and electronics package can be devised, and are within the scope of this invention.
 FIG. 77 shows an anatomically correctly shaped telephone according to another aspect of the invention. Telephone 3138 can be either a cellular phone or an ordinary cordless phone.

 FIG. 85 shows another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, the storage cord is secured to the user by means of clip 3187. FIG. 86 shows a variation on the storage cord of FIG. 85, where the electronics package is secured to the storage cord with clamps. The clamps can be adjusted to fit different sized electronics packages. It will be understood that other means for securing the electronics package to the cord may also be used, as shown in FIGS. 87, 88, and 89.
 FIG. 90 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, sleeve 3188 of storage cord 3189 is attached to securing means 3190, which is this case is attached to headband 3191. Securing means 3190, preferably shaped like the end of an eyeglass temple, may be either permanently or removably attached to headband 3191. This embodiment is shown in connected form in FIG. 91.
 FIGS. 91a and 91b  shows top view and a side view of an attachable clip for use with a storage cord of the invention. Attachment appendage 3192 is connected to dome 3193, which can optionally rotate around clip 3195, as shown by arrow 3194. Once clip 3195 has been attached to a wearable article, the sleeves of a storage cord according to the invention, may be attached to attachment appendage 3192, securing the storage cord to the user. Attachment appendage 3192 can also be extendable, as shown in FIG. 92. The clip may then be attached to a wearable article, such as headband 3196, as shown in FIG. 93.
By rotating the attachment appendages 3197 and 3198 to face downwards, it would also be possible to attach storage cord 3199 so that it passed under the user's chin, rather than behind his or her neck. This is illustrated in FIG. 94. FIG. 95 shows how clips 3200 may be attached to shirt 3201, or other wearable article, to permit attachment of a storage cord 3202 according to the invention.
 FIG. 96 shows a hair band for use with a storage cord according to the invention. Hair band 3203 has attachment appendages 3204 and 3205 at its ends. Attachment appendages 3204 and 3205 may be rotatable as illustrated by arrow 3206. FIG. 97 shows storage cord 3207 attached to head band 3208.
It is also possible to permanently attach attachment appendages to wearable articles, so as to make them compatible with storage cords having sleeves according to the invention. This is illustrated in FIG. 98, which shows bike helmet 3209 having attachment appendage 3210 (and a similar one, not shown, on the other side). Storage cord 3211 can then be attached for use.
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 99, the storage cord of the invention can be permanently affixed to a wearable article, such as helmet 3212. The user can then pull out electronics package 3213 to look at it, and then replace it, with the assistance of the retractable cord (not shown).
 FIG. 100 illustrates several views of another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, storage cord 3214 is made of a more rigid material and is shaped to fit around the users neck or shoulders (or other body part). The ear buds may either be attached using wires or arms, as shown. In this embodiment, the storage cord may be used without attachment to another wearable article. FIG. 101 shows an system for securing attachment appendages around the user's ears, which might be useful if the user is not wearing a hat or shirt. Similarly, the ends of the storage cord may be shaped to fit around a user's ears, securing the storage cord to the user.
 FIG. 102 shows another embodiment of a storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, all elements of storage cord 3215 are soft, maximizing the user's comfort. Electronics package 3216 is stored in pocket 3217, which can be either open (as shown in the figure) or sealable (with a zipper, or button, or other sealing mechanism). Retractable spool 3218 is stored in sealed pocket 3219, and is electronically connected with ear buds 3220 and 3221 via wires 3222 and 3223.
 FIG. 103 illustrates anther useful embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, storage cord 3224 contains Bluetooth receiver 3225, which can receive signals from nearby, Bluetooth enabled devices, such as MP3 players or telephones. Bluetooth receiver 3225 takes these signals and transmits them as sound to the user through the ear buds. This allows the user to keep multiple electronic devices close by (for example in jacket pocket or briefcase) and use them simultaneously. The user can determine which device will be transmitting sound to his or her ears by manipulating a simple button located on the receiver. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 104, the Bluetooth receiverâor other receiver, like an AM or FM radio receiverâcan be placed on the storage cord, in addition to another electronics package. FIG. 105 illustrates how the Bluetooth receiver on the storage cord can receive signals from multiple sources and transmit sounds from those sources to the user.
 FIG. 106 illustrates another embodiment of the storage cord according to the invention. In this embodiment, electronics package 3226 may be controlled using infrared emitting remote control 3227 (like a television remote control) which, when not in use, may be stored on the storage cord. The infrared receiver may be located on the electronics package (as shown) or, preferably, on a device attached to one of the ear bud wires. In this position, it will be easier to activate using the remote control.
 FIG. 107 shows a similar embodiment, except that there is no retractable cord, so that the electronics package must stay on the storage cord in order to remain connected to the ear buds; this means the only practical way to control it is with the remote control. This configuration minimizes the number of parts for the storage cord.
 FIG. 108 shows a remote control for use with the embodiments of FIGS. 106 and 107. Because the remote control will be pointed towards the user when being used, the numbers are reversed from the usual pattern on the device, being âright side upâ when the device isâpointed at the user. Alternatively, IR emitter 3228 can point along an axis perpendicular to the main axis of the device, so that when it is pointed up, the IR signal will be directed back towards the user.
 FIG. 109 shows a storage cord where the electronics package is permanently affixed. A charge port is provided to charge the electronics package.
 FIG. 110 shows another embodiment. In this embodiment, the electronics package is a telephone. However, the heaviest and bulkiest parts of the phone (eg. the battery and antenna) are permanently affixed to the storage cord. The parts of the phone which must be user accessible (e.g. dial pad and display) are kept on a small, removably attached device, which communicates with the rest of the system using Bluetooth protocols. This is similar to the system described in connection with FIG. 39.
 FIG. 111 shows and embodiment in which the storage cord contains no electronics package, but instead communicates through wire 3230 with another system, for example a phone system. In this embodiment, the storage cord functions simply as a headset.
 FIG. 112 shows an embodiment in which the electronics package generates a noise cancellation signal, to assist in providing the user with quiet in an otherwise noisy environment (for example on an airplane.) The signal may be transmitted to the ear buds either by wires or wirelessly.
 FIGS. 113 and 114 show storage cords according to the invention which are connected to a hat using a series of buttons 3331 and 3332. The large number of buttons ensures a secure hold, and allows the hat to be adjustable in size, while maintaining a snug fit for the storage cord. This is a particularly useful configuration when the electronics package is a two-way radio, as is commonly used in hiking. Microphone 3333 allows the user to speak and have that sound transmitted via the two way radio.
Other variations and embodiments will be apparent to one skilled in the art upon reviewing remaining FIGS. 115â
Another object of this invention is to provide a new and novel thermal pad for the application of cold or heat to the neck and/or head area for cooling or heating the brain.
A further object of this invention is to provide a storage cord adapted to secure and/or anchor a thermal pad which covers the neck area, and may extend to other areas of the head, neck, and shoulders. The best place in the head to provide the largest amount of thermal energy transferred to the brain is the back of the neckâthe back of the neck has a large less insulated areas than other parts of the head since there is no thick bone, such as the skull, and a thick layer of tissue called galea aponeurotica. In addition, the carotid arteries are in closer proximity with the surface of the skin in this neck area than other parts of the head. A preferred embodiment includes a storage cord having an extended thermal pad covering the neck in which only the skin of the neck is exposed to the thermal energy and the remainder of the thermal pad facing the exterior is well insulated, preventing the warming up of the gel or ice placed inside the bag. For the purpose of illustration some figures show a mesh facing the environment in order to show the thermal pack inside the pouch. However, it is understood that any portion facing the environment includes preferably insulating material. The thermal pad container of the storage cord can also include a radiant heat-reflecting film over various portions thereof, and an insulator over the same or other portions and which together facilitate directional cooling or heating the skin area.
The thermal neck device of present invention can work as a stand alone unit or can be anchored with a storage cord holding an electronic device. The thermal neck device or thermal neck pad of the present invention applied to the neck area promotes selective brain cooling or selective brain heating for treating hyperthermia and hypothermia respectively. The brain, which is the most sensitive organ to thermally induced damage, can be protected by applying heat to the neck via the storage cord during hypothermia or removing heat during hyperthermia. The cooling or heating is selective since the temperature of the remaining body may not need to be changed, this is particularly important when cooling the brain for treating patients with stroke or any brain damage. The majority of the brain tissue is water and the removal or application of heat necessary to cool or heat the brain can be precisely calculated using well known formulas based on BTU (British thermal unit). A BTU is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree F., when a pound of water cools 1 F, it releases 1 BTU.
The thermal pad of the storage cord for therapeutic treatment of excessive heat or excessive cold in the brain preferably includes a pouch for receiving a thermal bag (or thermal packet or thermal pack) having a substantially convex surface including a comma, banana, or circular shape, with said thermal pack being preferably in complete overlying relationship with the entire neck, said bag including an outer wall and an inner wall defining a sealed cavity to be filled with ice, gel-like material, water, solid material, and the like, for cooling or heating the skin area overlying the neck and adjacent areas to the neck and shoulder.
An exemplary brain cooling or brain heating device includes hot and cold pad or pack adapted to fit and match the neck anatomy and comprising a preferably flexible and sealed pad and a gel within said pad, said gel being comprised of a mixture of water, a freezing point depressant selected from the group consisting of propylene glycol, glycerine, and mixtures thereof associated with other compounds such as sodium polyacrylate, benzoate of soda, hydroxibenzoate, and mixtures thereof and a thickening agent. Any other cooling or heating device or chemical compounds and gels including a combination of ammonium nitrate and water can be used as cooling agent as well as heating agents such as a combination of iron powder, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, salt and Purge natural mineral powder. In addition, electric, such as Peltier device, a serpentine circulating water or fluid, and the like anchored or as integral part of the storage cord can be used. In this embodiment, the electrical portions, small motor for moving water in a serpentine, heating and cooling electrical parts and electronics including microprocessor can be housed in the storage in a permanent or releasable manner, exemplifying thus other embodiments for the DEP of this invention.
 FIG. 166 shows a diagrammatic view of a preferred eyeglasses thermal pack cord also referred to herein as eyeglasses cold/hot pack adapted for use with an eyeglasses, and having two sleeves for anchoring to the temples of eyeglasses and central portion that has means for holding thermal bags. Any means to hold thermal bags in the central portion of the storage cord can be used. The eyeglasses storage cord illustratively has two pouches or pockets for receiving thermal bags, with a mesh like structure forming the pouch. The mesh like structure is preferably the face of the pouch in contact with the skin while the opposite face of the pouch comprises insulating material, such as Thinsulate, polyurethane layer, polypropylene layer, Mylar, and the like. The left pouch is shown having a thermal pack and the right pouch is shown empty, and about to receive a thermal pack. The portion of the pouch facing the skin is made in a way to allow unobstructed transfer of thermal energy from thermal bag to the skin including minimal amount of material disposed between the bag and the skin. The pouch may further comprise no material between bag and skin, and in this embodiment the bag is hold in the pocket by flanges in the periphery preferably with some elasticity for more stability.
 FIG. 167 shows in more detail a perspective view of the single cold/hot pack device, represented by a device to be applied to the back of the neck, including preferably a pad having one generally convex surface and an essentially flat or slightly convex surface, with said surfaces being sealed in a conventional fashion at its ends to enclose a quantity of a gel-like material which fills the pad sufficiently to enable said pad to be closely conformed to the anatomy of the back of the head and neck area.
 FIG. 168 shows the specialized convex surface of the cold/hot pack of the invention and the matching surface of the back of the head and neck area. The cold/heat pack preferably includes a lip, handle or any means to facilitating grasping the pack for placement in or removal from the pocket. The cold/heat pack device can include a pillow-like configuration which permits better molding of The surface opposite to the skin or facing the environment may include a hard part made preferably of hard rubber or plastic attached to a bag made of soft plastic with said bag containing gel and being deformable upon external pressure. The surface of the bag facing the skin may also contain an adhesive portion in its periphery for better conforming and apposing to the skin of the neck. Any suitable adhesive for skin including double sided tape can be used.
For one of the preferred embodiments, prior to use the thermal pack would be put into a freezer or other chilling device for use as a cold pad or would be put into hot water to be used as a hot pad. The thermal pad preferably comprises a tough flexible envelope of plastic material. The material within the thermal pad is preferably a gel which will maintain its gel-like consistency over a wide range of temperatures. There exist many gels which can be cooled to freezing and which absorb heat during warmup. There are a number of different types of such gels. Some of them freeze solid, and some are flexible even at 0 degrees F. Cold packs such as a frozen water-alcohol mixture can also be used. Alternatively, a thermal pad includes a bag having inner and outer walls lined interiorly with plastic which define a cavity to be filled with ice, or fluid such as water, through an opening in the bag. In this instance the bag is preferably sealed with a rubber material or a water-proof material.
Although flexible plastic is described as a preferred material for containing the gel, it is understood that any material or fabric can be used including vinyl, cotton, rayon, rubber, thermoplastic, synthetic polymers, mixtures of materials, and the like. The size and shape of the pad structure is adapted to fit the special anatomy of the back of the head and neck and for matching the special geometry of the anatomic area. By using detachable thermal bags secured inside pockets, the bags can be easily replaced when said bags return to the original temperature. Therefore, in the summer time, when the bags, which were initially cold, invariably become hot as a result of the second law of thermodynamics, said bags can be easily replaced by a cold one. Accordingly, the invention includes a kit comprised of an insulating container having at least one thermal pack. The kit may also include a storage cord, and yet further include an electronic device, and furthermore can include a wearable article. The kit can include an insulating container and a box holding the other articles.
Any cooling or heating device known in the art can be used in the pad treatment device including hot or cold water flowing through tubes that are adapted to carry or deliver heat to the area. The tubes can be mounted in any head gear or the frame of eyeglasses, pumping mechanisms can be mounted in the head gear or eyeglasses for providing a continuous flow of water through the tubes. The pad can be connected to tubes which have connectors for joining to a water temperature control and circulating unit in the storage cord anchored to head gear or eyeglasses. Hot or cold liquid is circulated through tubes which are in communication with each other and which deliver or remove heat from the neck area.
Clip, elastic band, hook and loop fastener, and the like can be used for securing the storage cord thermal pad in position. Any of the support structures mentioned herein can be used to secure the storage cord thermal pad in position including a piece of glue. For example, the thermal pack can include a clip like mechanism to be anchored to a storage cord or the thermal pack can be secured to the temples of the frame of eyeglasses.
Head mounted gear including helmets and caps can include an extension covering the neck, said extension having a pocket for receiving a thermal bag of the invention. The extension having thermal pouches can be permanently attached to the head mounted gear or being releasably connected to said head mounted gear. The extension can include cooling or heating devices for delivering or removing heat from the neck area. The head mounted gear can also be adapted to receive a thermal pack without an extension. In this embodiment the head mounted gear has a recess or cavity which can receive the thermal bags. A helmet with such extension or cavity can be useful during sports. The thermal bag is secured in the cavity or extension with pockets at the beginning of the physical activity. During a break the thermal bag is removed and then replaced with a new one having the desired temperature for example to reduce the temperature in the brain of a football player in the summer, or for warming up the brain of a skier during a winter competition.
An alternative embodiment includes a thermal pad anchored to the storage cord for supplying water to evaporatively cool the neck area. In this instance the cold feeling is generated by evaporative cooling in the neck area directly on the skin or by a piece of material which retains water.
Any cooling or heating device can be used to cool or heat the neck area for selective brain cooling or brain heating, preferably using a moldable device that conforms to the anatomy of the region, with directional temperature control properties for cooling or heating the skin. Any of the devices for heating or overheating or for cooling, including electrical, chips, semiconductor, polymers, and the like known in the art as well as described by Abreu in U.S. Pat. No. 6,544,193, herein incorporated in their entirety by reference, can be adapted in support structures connected to or being part of a storage cord for positioning at the neck area, and used for cooling or heating the brain.

Electronic package can be adapted to receive any wireless signal including satellite and wireless internet signal. It is understood that the storage cord may provide several other functions including changing color of the lens of a regular eyewear since the larger electrical parts and battery can be stored away while keeping the frames of eyeglasses light and elegant. A digital binocular with photo capabilities is also contemplated, in which the electronics re stored in the storage and the frame only supports the binocular lens. A digital binocular attached to an eyewear storage cord can also be used, in the same manner as the forehead light embodiment. A tracking device with internet wireless capabilities can also be integrated into any embodiments of this invention. A camera, or microphone disclosed in some embodiments can be replaced or have add a laser or light source for alignment or measuring distance such as in professional activities or sports such as playing golf or pool, allowing the visual axis to be aligned with line of the laser light. Only a light laser is located next to the eye while other parts are housed in the storage cord.
Any combination of electronic devices can be used, as well as any combination of wearable articles and of support structures. For example, a C-collar may include a GPS in one side and music player on the opposite side of the C-shaped structure.
Electronic device in the storage cord may include a recorder, in which a small and discrete microphone is placed next to the face and other large parts and memory are stored in the storage cord. An ultrasound device can be housed in the storage cord and prevent attack from dogs by emitting a certain sound, allowing a runner not to have to hold the device. The storage cord may further include a motion sensor to detect someone behind as well as infrared sensor and/or odor detector to analyze odors and the presence of certain chemical elements, such as biochemical weapons.
and/or odor detector to analyze odors and the presence of certain chemical elements, such as biochemical weapons.
Due to the apposition to the skin the storage cord can also a variety of biological monitoring devices that can capture biological data. In addition delivery of drugs through the skin can be accomplished by adapting iontophoretic devices to the storage cord as well as by placing patches delivering medications on the surface of the cord touching the skin including housing an insulin pump for delivery of insulin and glucose. An improved hearing aid can be achieved by using a microphone to amplify the sound, and then deliver to the ear with the ear bud assembly. Likewise, a camera with zoom and/or magnifying capabilities can be used with the parts divided between the front and back of the head, heavier parts disposed in the storage cord.
Other devices that can be housed and take advantage of the location is a motion device for massaging the neck area. Electronics of an air purifier can be disposed in the C-shape device around the neck and adjacent to the nose. A pedometer can be housed in the storage cord allowing distance to be calculated, as well as a GPS adapted to calculate distance and speed.
The wearable computer includes a combination of adjustably positionable arms and adjustably extendable arms, being disposed in the two side of the U-shape structure. It is also understood that a variety of supporting means can be used for the wearable computer. Accordingly, FIG. 45C shows a user wearing inverted U-shape computer 2000 with display 2010 a including a bi-pod system 2010 b for resting against the body. A tripod also can be used for the keyboard, which is further held in place by clips secured to a piece of clothing. FIG. 45D shows a preferred spinal configuration for the wearable computer 2000 a, including a display 2010 c having a tripod attachment 2010 d and one adjustably extendable portion 2012 a being compressed while the opposite adjustably extendable portion 2012 b being in an extended position. Any type of stop assembly or mechanism can be used including portable hand held devices separated from the wearable computer 2000 a, exemplified herein as clip 2012 c.
