In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 is pre-registered or configured to allow the use of the location-based service 10 and information or data associated with the location-based service 10. In addition and in this embodiment, location-based information is sent or is otherwise available to the wireless device 20 automatically. In one embodiment the wireless device 20 is within the location, while in other embodiments the wireless device 20 is in near proximity to the location, while in still other embodiments the wireless device 20 is not near the location at all. This embodiment thus contemplates a wireless device's flexibility in receiving information from a specific location whether the device is close to the defined location or not. In another embodiment the location-based service accesses a database that stores indoor location-based information or outdoor location-based information.
For example, a wireless device 20 user is in San Francisco, Calif. on a business trip but wants to receive location information from a mall, school, or any other location in Tyler, Tex. The location service 10, in this embodiment, is capable of providing such information to the user. This embodiment then allows the user in San Francisco to receive information related to the mall in Tyler, Tex. or know when his children were leaving school if the school was a geofenced area 60. It should be noted that this example is for illustrative purposes only and is not limiting. In another embodiment, a computing device or wireless device is associated with a geofenced area comprising energy operations data. In this embodiment, the user of the computing device or wireless device is configured to receive information that is associated with the geofenced area comprising energy operations data. Further in this embodiment, the user is able to analyze both for applying economic decision analysis and production decision analysis techniques on the energy operations data within the geofenced area. In another embodiment, economic and production decision analysis techniques are methods used to analyze how certain factors may impact the production or economic factors associated with an oil well, gas well, or pipeline. In another embodiment, the economic decision analysis and production decision analysis techniques performed using at least some energy operations data are used to predict or forecast future events associated with a drilling operation, geofenced area, or adaptive drilling profile. In another embodiment, a message is sent to a computing device or wireless device when a predefined event occurs within the geofenced area. For example and in an embodiment where the geofence is associated with energy operations data related to drilling operations, if the oil well is out of service or oil production stops for some reason, a message is sent to the computing device or wireless alerting the user of this event. In another embodiment, a user associated with a geofenced area can receive a message when a friend, asset, or event occurs within the geofenced area. In another embodiment, a user have predefined a geofenced area is capable of receiving information associated with the geofenced area. In another embodiment, a user can search for responsive energy operations data associated with a geofenced area. In another embodiment, a geofenced area can be an electronic designation associated with a given location wherein the user can request or receive information associated with the geofence area. For example, a user may define a geofenced area for her favorite apparel store. In this embodiment, the user is able to receive updates, advertisements, or other information associated with the geofenced area no matter where the user is located. In another embodiment, a geofenced area can be a resort. In this embodiment, the resort can send out announcements, emergency information, weather information, advertisements or other information associated with the resort to the user.
While in some embodiments the location-based services 10 only provides location-based information when the wireless device 20 is in near-proximity or within the specific location of interest, in one embodiment, the wireless device 20 uses or receives any type of location-based information provided by a location-based service 10. In another embodiment, the location-based service 10 is only temporarily available to the wireless device 20 when the wireless device 20 is either in near-proximity to a certain location or within the location. In this embodiment, the location-based service 10 or application can remove itself automatically or be pre-programmed to remove itself from the wireless device 20 after the wireless device 20 left the location. For example in one embodiment, the user upon entering a location where a location-based service is operable can use the location-based service while within or in near proximity to the location, but when the user leaves the application or location-based service can remove itself from the wireless device 20. In this embodiment, the user will avoid having a gluttony of icons on the wireless device that represent services or applications associated with a certain location. In another embodiment, the script or application is only interpreted or executed when the wireless device 20 in near-proximity to a certain location.

A wireless device 20 must merely be associated with a location-based service 10 to take advantage of the location-based service 10. In one embodiment, the wireless device 20 is associated with a location-based service 10 if it is able to receive location information from the location-based service 10. In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 is associated with the location-based service 10 if it is in near proximity or within a certain location. Still in an additional embodiment, the wireless device 20 is associated with a location-based service 10 no matter where the wireless device 20 is physically located (e.g. anywhere in the world). In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 is associated with a location-based service 10 if it can receive any information from the location-based service 10.
As previously discussed, in one embodiment geo-fencing is utilized. A geo-fence can either be created dynamically or be associated with a physical object in a static manner. In one embodiment, when a user of the wireless device 20 or a computing device enters an area that is geofenced the wireless device 20 will receive a notification (SMS text, MMS text, voice response, email, or any other type of notification) that is has entered a certain location. The notification can include information related to whether the user wants to opt-in to a location-based service 10, register with a location, receive information about the location that is geofenced, or information about other wireless device 20 users within the geofenced locations. In another embodiment, wireless device 20 or computing device users create their own geofenced areas. Within this embodiment, users are able to assign or control certain attributes of the geofenced location, including whether certain people can join the geofenced area 60, what information is displayed to the members of the geofenced area 60, and whether the members can view the information after leaving the geofenced area 60. For example, within a high school a wireless device 20 user can assign a group of lockers as a geo-fence called âlockers.â In this example, the wireless device 20 user decides that the only members of the âlockersâ geo-fence are the students assigned those lockers and the device user also decides what information, games, polls, symbols, insignia, or any other data that is associated with âlockersâ geo-fence. In another embodiment, a location-based service can create a class schedule, assignments, enrollment information, accounting information, grades, documents and other traditional school items upon request by a user and return at least some of this information to a user via an intranet or the Internet. In this embodiment, the location-based server can search for these items based upon a geofence. In another embodiment, the location-based service is programmed to model unique location-based information based upon the adaptive profile of the user and provide the user with customized data upon request. In another embodiment, a user of a computing device or wireless device 20 can define or select a geofenced area 60 or multiple geofenced areas. In one embodiment, the geofenced areas are displayed on a graphical map interface on the computing device or wireless device 20. The user can select one or more geofenced areas displayed on the mapping interface and request additional information from the selected geofenced areas. The additional information can include any location information as well functionality associated with location information. In another embodiment, upon selection of a certain geofenced area 60 from the mapping interface, the computing device or wireless device 20 is operable to receive either additional location information, a link to additional location information, or functions associated with the location information or both. In yet another embodiment, the computing device or wireless device 20 is operable to receive updated location based information associated with a given geofenced location. In yet another embodiment, inside a certain geofenced area 60, a user tags certain points or creates certain boundaries that can provide an update when an individual, vehicle, or other wireless device 20 passes through the point or boundary within the geofenced area 60. For example, in a shopping area, a user can tag a certain location and share it with her friends and by doing so the friends could then meet at the tagged location. In another embodiment, the a wireless device 20 that is a vehicle can mark a location within a geofenced location that may be a restroom, business, or other location that the user of the vehicle wants to remember or receive location-based information from. In another embodiment, the wireless device 20, can be a vehicle and the wireless device can use the current traffic conditions as a parameter for calculating a certain route to a location. In another embodiment, the user can tag or otherwise identify a location within a geofence or wireless network 40 and associate content (text, photographs, video, or messages) with the tagged location. For example, a user may tag a restaurant and associate photograph with the location. In this embodiment, the user can choose to share this location or location with the photograph to other wireless users. In this embodiment, the user can also save the location or location with the photograph as favorite location on the wireless device 20 or with the location-based service 10. In another embodiment, a type of location-based video game can be played where physical locations within a wireless network or geofenced area/location have certain predetermined or user-determined attributes and are associated with a location-based video game that involves the geofenced area/location.
In addition, users of geofenced areas can select the permissions and rights associated with the geofenced location. For example, a user selects certain permissions that provide certain information associated with the user to be provided to other users in a geofenced location but not all information or data associated with a user to other users in a geofenced location. The ability to set certain permissions either automatically or dynamically by the user helps manage the user's geo-fence preferences. Thus, in this embodiment, a computing device or wireless device 20 itself can be configured to handle permissions and other issues related to geofenced locations automatically or dynamically without having the user's input. Conversely, in another embodiment, wireless device 20 users can also manually change the permissions and other rights associated with a geofenced location manually. In yet another embodiment, the wireless device 20 can update information it provides to a geofenced location without user input.
Similarly, in another embodiment, owners of business can set up geo-fences around a physical store or location (one or more geo-fences if necessary). Thus, in this embodiment, owners can manage the content to be displayed to users that subscribe, register, and/or enter the geofenced store location. As a result, in this embodiment, the business can provide marketing or sales advertisement to members of the geofenced area 60, games associated with the business location, a list of users at the store, a list of the inventory physically located in the store, polls for the users to take, users can also purchase items in the geofenced stores through their wireless devices, can comment on certain merchandise, can post pictures, video, and/or other media to the geofenced location. In another embodiment, users that are associated with geofenced areas (keeping in mind the users can be thousands of miles away, in near-proximity of the geofenced location, or within the geofenced location) can purchase items from the geofenced location. Similarly, in another embodiment, a business can market to members of geofenced areas whether the users are at the geofenced location or not.
In another embodiment, a geofenced location is searchable by users. For example in an embodiment, if the geofenced location is a grocery store and the wireless device 20 user is looking for cream of mushroom soup, the user upon registering with a location-based service 10, wireless network 40, and/or with the particular geofenced location searches the grocery store for cream of mushroom soup on the wireless device 20. In the present embodiment, the geofenced location or wireless network 40, either by itself of through a location-based service 10, performs a search and then returns the search results to the wireless device 20. The search results (e.g. the location of the cream of mushroom soup) can then be presented the user in a number of various formats. By way of example only and without limitation, the user can be presented with the search results by presenting to the user a map of the store with an icon showing the location of the item searched for with an icon; the search results can also be displayed on a map in 3D, through a voice-activated response system, graphical map interface, or the information can be sent to the user via a notification, message, email, video, voice response, or any other method associated with a wireless device 20.
 FIG. 24 depicts one embodiment of obtaining location-based information. FIG. 24 represents a method of using location-based information that includes gaining access to a geofenced area or areas 101, once access is gained determining the current location of a wireless device or wireless devices 102, determining whether the wireless device or devices is within the geofenced area 103 and if so, providing at least some location-based information 104.

In one embodiment, a wireless device 20 can obtain access to a geofenced area or areas by registering or simply using a server or application that allows for access to location-based information. The service or application can determine the location of the wireless device using at least one or a combination of location-determination methods. Alternatively, the wireless device is capable of determining its location using at least one or more location-determination techniques or using a motion sensor. In an embodiment, once the location of the wireless device is determined, a decision can be made on whether the wireless device 20 is within a geofence area. Upon making a decision of whether the wireless device 20, a wireless device is capable of receiving location-based information that is directly associated with a location or geofenced area. This method is useful to the extent that wireless device 20 can receive information associated with its location that may be more relevant to the user of the wireless device 20. In another embodiment, a geofence or geofences is associated with an online campus where the geofence is associated with specific programs or classes that relate to a certain topic, degree program, or class management associated with a group of people. FIG. 25 depicts one embodiment of obtaining location-based information wherein the wireless device has settings. As shown in FIG. 25, if the wireless device is within the geofenced area, then according or based upon the settings of the wireless device, then at least some location-based information is provided to the wireless device 105. For example, in one embodiment the wireless device 20 comprises settings set such that location-based information is turned off to conserve battery life. In such an embodiment, location-based information would not be provided to the wireless device 20.
Referring to FIG. 26, depicts one embodiment of obtaining location-based information wherein a plurality of geofenced areas are monitored. As depicted, this embodiment comprises monitoring a plurality of geofenced areas 106, and if a certain pre-determined condition is met or occurs sending an alert to a specific wireless device 107 and periodically monitor the plurality of geofenced areas for additional alert conditions that can be met 108. For example, a geofenced location can have electronic borders that have certain permissions or security settings associated with it. One example includes a bank having a secure wireless intranet in which the geo-fence marks the physical boundaries of the secure wireless network 40 such that the physical layout of the bank makes up the geofenced area 60. In yet another embodiment, the geofenced area 60 is based upon certain wireless devices identification either on a network, through the SSID, MAC address, user ID, MAC-48 identifier, EUI-48, EUI-64, IP authentication headers, encapsulating security payloads, security associations using ISAKMP, IPSec using the Security Parameter Index, or any other authentication method or any other identifying method used with wireless devices, which provides certain encryption techniques to wireless device 20 users on the geofenced location. Accordingly, a wireless device 20 user can enter the geofenced location and become a secure user of the geofenced locations intranet or network. In yet another embodiment, the user of the wireless device 20 can use a mobile payment system to purchase items within a certain wireless network 40, location, or geofenced area 60.
In yet another embodiment, geo-fencing is used to identify when a person, item, or any other tangible item either enters or leaves a certain geofenced location. In this embodiment, the person or item comprises an associated identifier that can be read by the network, location-based service 10, server(s), database(s), and/or wireless device 20 that allows for a user to receive a notification that a person and/or item has either entered or left the geofenced area 60.

In one embodiment, a wireless device 20 or computing device can be associated with a communications link. In yet another embodiment, the communications link can select the encryption technique to be used based upon the characteristics of the communications link, the characteristics of the data to be sent over the communications link, the efficiency of a given encryption technique, or any combination of the foregoing. The system in this embodiment can be any combination of hardware including any of the following: server, database, wireless network 40, location-based service 10, computing device, and/or wireless device 20.
In yet another embodiment, a wireless device 20 is configured to receive location-based information based upon the heading or general direction of the wireless device, wherein the heading or general direction can be ascertained by a directional component residing on the wireless device. A directional component can include, but is not limited to, a microprocessor, circuit, motion sensor, compass component, or any other combination of hardware or software that is capable of ascertaining the directional movement or heading of a wireless device. This heading or general direction information is shared or provided to a location-based service 10, software application, localized terminal, server, database, or computing device. In another embodiment, a location-based service 10 receives heading or directional movement information from a wireless device, and based upon that information provide location-based information to the wireless device based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device. In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 executes at least part of a software application that is configured to provide location-based information to the wireless device 20 based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device. The wireless device 20 can also be in operative communication with an indoor location-based service that provides indoor location-based information to the wireless device based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device. In one embodiment, the wireless device 20 receives advertisements that are based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device. In one embodiment, the wireless device 20 ascertains its own heading or directional movement and requests location-based information from either a mobile payment system 70, location-based service 10, wireless network 40, server, database, or other wireless device based upon the heading or movement of the wireless device. In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 is configured to receive or ascertain data regarding its heading or directional movement and filter location-based information based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device 20. In another embodiment, the wireless device is operable to communicate with a software application that provides location-based information that is based upon the heading or directional movement of the wireless device 20. In another embodiment, the location-based service 10 is in communication with at least one wireless device and configured to receive heading or directional movement information from the wireless device 20. In one embodiment, a wireless device comprises a NFC-enabled data management component that is configured to initiate a communication using magnetic field induction techniques. In this embodiment, the location-based service 10 is configured to receive a plurality of headings or directional movements from one or more wireless devices and is able to determine trends, graphs, movement analytics, or analysis of the directional movements or headings to provide such information to a server, vendor, wireless device, database, or other entity.
In another embodiment, the location-based service 10 comprising a server and database is configured to receive a plurality of directional movement or heading data from one or more wireless devices through the server and send such information to be stored on the database.

In one embodiment the data management component 30 resides on the wireless device 20, referring now to FIGS. 11-13, and manages location-based information received by the wireless device 20. In this embodiment the data management component 30 serves as the manager of location-based information for the wireless device 20. Still further in another embodiment, the data management component 30 resides on the wireless device 20 and computes distances between the wireless device 20 and other tangible items located in either a location-based service 10 or geofenced area 60. The data management component 30 calculates distances using the location of the wireless (which can be ascertained through a myriad of technologies) and compare it to the location of the physical or tangible item within either a wireless network 40, geofenced area 60 and/or location based service. In another embodiment and referring to FIGS. 11-13, the wireless device is configured to calculate the distance between a physical item and the wireless device and is not associated with a data management component. In another embodiment, the data management component 30 calculates the distance of a tangible item or user by accessing a location-based service 10, tables with the associated location of the item, or other data that can provide the location of a tangible item. Referring again to FIG. 13, the wireless device can be in near proximity to a wireless network, plurality of wireless network, geofenced area 60, or plurality of geofenced areas. In another example, the data management component 30 updates itself dynamically through interactions with various wireless networks, location-based services 10 and/or geofenced locations. In this example, the data management component 30 monitors location-based services 10 and/or geofenced locations for updates on time-sensitive information, updateable information, advertisements, users within such a service or location, inventories, employees, revenues, items for sale, polls, video, photographs, and/or purchases made. In another embodiment, the data management component 30 updates the location information on the wireless device 20 without interaction required by the user. In yet another embodiment the data management component 30 is contextually aware and can receive updated location information as the wireless device 20 moves into certain locations that have either a location-based service 10, wireless network 40, and/or geofenced locations. For example, in one embodiment a wireless device that is capable of receiving or displaying location-based information is associated with a data management component 30. In this embodiment, the data management component is contextually aware because it can analyze, recognize, or even predict its surroundings or future movements of the wireless device by analyze the movement of the wireless device 20. In this embodiment, the data management component can also be contextually aware by using past locations visited by the wireless device 20, favorite locations visited by the wireless device, or positioning data stored by the wireless device to receive location-based information from a service or software application without input by the user. In one embodiment, the data management component 30 becomes contextually aware by recognizing location-based information is available based upon the location of the wireless device 20 and then request or receive location-based information without the user having to manually perform a search for location-based information. An advantage of this invention is that the burden on the user is lessened and the data management component 30 is able to receive, request, modify, calibrate, determine, format, or display location-based information with minimal input from the user. In another embodiment, a data management component is configured to use an adaptive profile to associate energy operations data with a specific area (both above ground or subterranean) that can be used or processed by a user or location-based service to create a certain display based upon the system settings or user input. In another embodiment, a data management component 30 is able to create an adaptive drilling profile associated with a geofenced location that may be provided to the user for further analysis or manipulation via a graphical user interface or mapping interface. In addition, a data management component is also configured to schedule tasks associated with processing information associated with an adaptive profile and where the data management component can determine whether certain functions should be performed using serial techniques, through parallel processing techniques, or both to be more efficiently provide data to a user.
Calculating the distance of a tangible item can be performed by any method compatible with a computing device, wireless device 20, or location-based service 10. One example is through the use of location determination methods which include, but is not limited to, cell of origin, distance, angle, location pattern recognition, or any combination of each. Cell of origin can be used to track the cell that a wireless device 20 is associated with. To improve the accuracy of the cell of origin technique cells can provide a received signal strength indication or use a highest signal strength technique. Another example of calculating the distance is through use of time of arrival methods. Time of arrival can be used to ascertain the time the wireless device 20 sends a signal to a wireless network 40. In one embodiment, the time of arrival uses an equation such as D=c(t) to determine the distance between the wireless device 20 and the receiver, wireless network 40, or base station. In addition time of arrival can be used to implement a tri-lateration or multi-lateration technique. Time of arrival can also be used by a wireless device 20, wireless network 40, location-based service 10, or computing device in two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional planes. In another example, the wireless device 20, wireless network 40, computing device, and/or location-based service 10 use time of arrival to locate the wireless device 20. One possible implementation of time of arrival is represented as TDOAB-A=|TBâTA|=k. This value of this equation is then used to create a hyperbola with foci, which represents possible locations of the wireless device 20. In one embodiment, multiple base stations are used to calculate time difference of arrival or observed time difference of arrival. Additional hyperbolas can be added for improved performance and one such example is the use of hyperbolic multi-lateration. Lateration can also be accomplished by using received signal strength, which can measured by the mobile device or location-based service 10, wireless network 40, base station, or a receiver. The time difference of arrival method can also incorporate antenna gains or path loss to solve the distance of the wireless device 20 and location-based service 10, wireless network 40, base station, or a receiver. Received signal strength can also be further implemented by using received-signal strength tri-lateration and multi-lateration for improved location accuracy.
Angle of arrival can also be used to determine location. The angle of arrival can be configured to use the angle of incidence to determine location as well. Multiple cell towers or base stations can calculate the angle of arrival of the signal from the wireless device 20 and use this information to perform tri-angulation after which the data can be converted into latitude and longitude or Cartesian coordinates. Location pattern techniques can also be used to ascertain the location of a wireless device 20. Location pattern techniques can use a RF profile or signature and/or signal propagation characteristics and/or possible received signal strength. Location pattern techniques can also use time of arrival, time difference of arrival, time difference of arrival-based RF signatures as well. Wireless access points can be used on the system side to sample signal strength of the mobile device. Location pattern recognition can also use an array or location vector of received signal strength values, which can be stored in a database. Location pattern techniques can also implement algorithms to find the minimal statistical distance between certain vectors or to Bayesian probability interferences.

In another embodiment, the wireless device 20 in association with the data management component 30 uses an adaptive profile to apply either dynamically, automatically, or manually to certain location-based services 10 and/or geofenced locations. For example, in one embodiment, an adaptive profile associated with the user is used for interacting with a location-based service 10, mobile payment system 70, or geofenced location/area. In this embodiment, the adaptive profile can be used to interact with these services or system where preferences or data related to the user is provided automatically or manually. In another embodiment, an advantage for the user of an adaptive profile is that it can be defined or set and then used to interact with certain services or software. In one example, an adaptive profile is used for interacting with a location-based service that displays the user's sports preferences, retail preferences, location preferences, or current location. In this example, the adaptive profile changes based upon user interactions but is also used to limit the amount of data input the user must perform. In another example, an adaptive profile could represent a handle or other public identification such as a username that is used with a location-based service 10. In another embodiment, an adaptive profile is associated with an oil or gas location and includes at least some energy operations data related to the location. In this embodiment, the adaptive profile could then be used and updated as needed based upon events at the oil or gas location. In another embodiment, an oil or gas adaptive profile is defined by a user or location-based service 10. In another embodiment, a location-based service 10 can provide energy operations data by itself or as part of an adaptive drilling profile that is in near proximity to a geographic location. In other words, near proximity means that the energy operations data relates to a general geographic location such as a county, drilling operation, or other location. Near proximity can also include data sets of energy operations data related to geographic locations that are in close relation or even adjacent to one another. In another embodiment, near proximity can include data that is related geographically within a general vicinity.

In another embodiment, an adaptive profile can be displayed on a three dimensional or four dimensional display, user interface, or mapping interface. In another embodiment, a location-based service 10 or data management component 30 can create an adaptive profile that is associated with a certain geographical area or location. In another embodiment, the adaptive profile is used with a mobile payment system 70 and is adaptive to the extent it can be modified by the actions of a user or mobile payment system 70. In another embodiment, the adaptive profile can be stored on a payment server that is accessible by a wireless device 20 upon initiating a mobile payment at a specific location. The adaptive profile can include privacy, security, and other settings associated with how much information is provided to a location-based service 10, network, computer, user, and/or geofenced location. The adaptive profile can be generated dynamically by the wireless device 20 or by the data management component 30. In yet another embodiment, the adaptive profile is generated using pre-selected values or tables of pre-selected values, dynamic information or any combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the adaptive profile allows the wireless device 20 to perform, at least in some manner, in a contextually aware manner and the wireless device 20 becomes contextually aware by dynamically updating the device with location information that is received from its surroundings. Security and privacy are two examples of challenges that currently face the location-based or location-aware movement.
