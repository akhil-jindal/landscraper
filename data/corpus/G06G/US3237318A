ATTOREYS United States Patent O APPARATUS FOR SIMULATING THE OPERATION OF AN ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATING PLANT Arthur I. Schager, 26913 N. Woodland Road, Beachwood, Ohio Filed July 23, 1963, Ser. No. 297,079 6 Claims. (Cl. 3-Itl) This invention relates to training devices and, more particularly, to an apparatus for .simulating the ope-ration of a functional system. While the invention is of general utility insofar as the operation and control of such systems is concerned, ithas particular utility in simulating the operation of electrical power generating plants and its structural Iarrangement and operation for use in that environment will be described herein. 
 In order to keep up with the steadily increasing demand for more electrical power, the trend of development in electrical power generating plants has been toward greater complex-ity of equipment and more efficient performance in the control and operation of this equipment. As a direct result of this increase in complexity of equipment and perform-ance demands, it is essential, for reasons of safety to human life and economy of operation, that the personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of the generating station be thoroughly trained at the outset and periodically refreshed in order to assure complete familiarity with the equipment and operational procedures. Accordingly, it is the principle object of this invention to facilitate this essential training need by providing a device which simulates the operation of a power generating plant. 
 In the absence of the apparatus of this invention, the standard procedure for training personnel in the operation of power generating plants was at best a long and laborious procedure which, for the most part, consisted of associating the trainee -with a skilled operator. In addition, the training program al-so included the study of a large volume of descriptive and instruction material associated with the hundreds of units and components which ym-ake up a power generating plant. -It is an object of this invention to provide a dev-ice for visually demonstrating the cooperative relationship o-f the units and components which make up the power generating system and the sequence of operations of the units. 
 Since the operat-ion of a power generating plant must of necessity be continuous, it was impossible to satisfactorily train and test operators adequately in many of the operating sequences and emergency procedures. Instead, the trainee-operator for the most part could only beco-me acquainted with these conditions and remedial procedures on a theoretical basis. Accordingly, it is a still further object of this invention to provide a training device which may be used to simulate the many operating sequences and emergency procedures and thereby thoroughly train operators without risk to personnel or equip-ment. 
 A still further and more particular object of this invention is to visually demonstrate and thereby familiarize plant personnel with all phases of interlocking circuit effects and results of removing components 4to prevent false and costly tripouts. 
 A still further object of this invention is to provide a training device which can be left `available for use by anyone, without supervision at any time, and without danger to actual plant equip-ment or interruption of power generation. 
"ice 
 According to this invention the foregoing objects are attained by providing apparatus for simulating the conditions of operation in a functional system, such as an electrical power generating plant. The apparatus includes a panel and condition indicating means, such as lamps on the panel for representing various operational conditions of the system. Further, the apparatus may include an electrical circuit connecting control means, such as switches, to the condition indicating means or lamps for controlling the energization thereof to thereby simulate various operating conditions of the equipme-nt. Also, the panel may include a display portion graphically illustrating in ilow pattern forrn the arrangement of the equipment components of the system. The panel may also include an alarm lamp portion including a plurality of alarm lamps for simulating various alarm conditions of the functional system.y Still further, the condition indicating means or lamps may be located on the display portion of the panel for representing the various equipment components of the system and their condition of operation. 
 The foregoing as well as other objects and advantages will become apparent from the following description used to illustrate the preferred embodiment of the present invention, as read in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which: 
 FIGURE l illustrates the panel face of the preferred embodiment of the invention including a display portion A, an alarm lamp portion B, an operating switch p-ortion C and a condition and trouble switch portion D; 
 FIGURES la and lb are enlarged views of display portion A respectively taken on the left and righ-t hand sid-es of line A-A in FIGURE l, graphically illustrating in flow pattern form the layout and arrangement of equipment components in a simulated electrical power generating plant; 
 FIGURE 2 is an enlarged View illustrating the alarm lamp portion B of FIGURE l; 
 FIGURE 3 is an enlarged view illustrating the operating switch portion C of FIGURE l; 
 FIGURE 4 is an enlarged view illustrating the condition and trouble switch portion D of FIGURE l; 
 FIGURES 5, 6 and 7 together illustrate a schematic circuit diagram of the preferred electric circuit to be used in this invention. 
 Referring now to the drawings, wherein the figures are shown for purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiment of the present invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, FIGURE l illustrates a control panel face. The panel face includes display portion A which graphically illustrates in tiow pattern the layout and arrangement of equipment components in a simulated electrical power generating plant. Display portion A .also mounts a plurality of component condition indicator lamps, numbered 92 through 184 (FIGURES la and lb). At least one indicator lamp is positioned adjacent each of the components of the graphically illustrated equipment so as to indicate the condition of the component. Further, a descriptive label appears on the face of display portion A adjacent each component represented and for each condition of operation or malfunction simulated. Red lamps are indicated by subscript r, green lamps are indicated by subscript g and white lamps are indicated by subscript w. The red and green lamps are component operation indicating lamps and represent the various equipment components of the plant and their condition of operation. The red lamps represent that the component associated therewith is operating in a correct manner. Green lamps represent that the component associated therewith is not operating. White lamps are either com ponent malfunction or alarm indicatingr lamps for respectively simulating whether various component malfunctions or generator plant alarm conditions exist as depicted by the associated descriptive labels. 
 Immediately below display portion A there is mounted on the panel, as shown in FIGURE 1, an alarm lamp portion B including eight power plant alarm condition lamps, numbered 71W, 72W, 73W, 74W, 75W, 82W, 86W and 91W. These lamps and descriptive labels therefor, which appear on the face of the panel, are shrown in greater detail in FIGURE 2. All of the lamps mounted on alarm lamp portion B are white lamps and each lamp indicates that a particular alarm condition exists. Thus, white lamp 71W, when on, indicates that a high furnace pressure condition exists. White lamp 72W, when on, indicates that one mill is running. White lamp 73W, when on, indicates that a boiler trip condition exists. White lamp 74W, when on, indicates that the fuel oil pressure is low. White lamp 75W, when on, indicates that low air ilow conditions exist. White lamp 82W, when on, indicates that a turbine trip condition exists. White lamp 86W, when on, indicates that load limit runback conditions exist. Lastly, white lamp 91W, when on, indicates that a unit trip exists. The significance of the above referred to alarm conditions will be more readily understood from the description of operation which follows. 
 Immediately below and to the left of the alarm lamp portion B there is provided on the control panel face an operating switch portion C. As shown in greater detail in FIGURE 3, the operating switch portion C comprises switches 1 through 30 and an equal number of descriptive labels therefor on the panel. Each of the operating switches 1 through 30 may be operated to simulate one of two conditions, as depicted by the descriptive labels associated with the switches, each condition being representative of a particular operation step in operating the simulated power generating plant. 
 Immediately below and to the right of alarm lamp portion B there is provided on the control panel face a condition and trouble switch portion D. As shown in greater detail in FIGURE 4, the condition and trouble switch portion D comprises switches 31 through 68 and an equal number of descriptive labels therefor on the panel. Each condition or malfunction is representative of a particular condition or malfunction which might occur during the operation of the power generating plant.

Fuel oil solenoid switch 4 also serves to connect red lamp 120r, which is connected in parallel with a series circuit including normally closed contacts FT, normally closed contacts 86- 12 and a relay coil 630 across volt-age source V via contact 4b. White lamp 125W is connected across voltage source V via switch 36. Drum level high switch 36 also serves to connect relay coil DLM across voltage source V. Drum level low switch 37 serves to connect white lamp 126W across voltage source V. White alarm lamp W is connected in parallel with a timer relay coil PART and across voltage source V via a set of normally open contacts PA'RR. White lamp 124W is connected in parallel with a series circuit including white alarm lamp 71W and a set of normally open contacts HFPT and also in parallel with a timer relay coil HFPT across the voltage source V via high furnace pressure switch 39. Having described the structure of the preferred embodiment of the invention, attention will now be directed toward the operation.

White lamp 9110 oft Unit Trip (A) START UP SEQUENCE The simulator oi the present invention is now in proper condition for an operator to simulate start up procedure of the simulated power plant, indicated by the graphic iiow pattern appearing on display pontion A in FIGURE 1. The start up procedure should be in accordance with the :following sequence ot operation: 
 (1) Closure of the start up supply breaker, represented by lamps 1721l and 171g, is simulated byl placing the start up supply breaker switch 29 in the closed position. From FIGUR-E 5 it is apparent 'that green llarnp 171g will beydeenergized a-nd red lamp 1721' will be energized by voltage source V via oon-tact 29b of switch 29 and a set of normally closed contacts 86-4, to thereby indicate that the start up supply breaker -is yclosed and operating. 
 (2) Opening of the stack breeching damper, represented by lamps 92g and 93r, is simulated Iby placing switch \1 in the open position. The stack breeching damper is conventionally located at the base of the eX- haust gas exit stack in a power gener-ating plant. The function of the damper is to isolate the exit stack from the boiler 4when maintenance work is required. Closure of switch 1 (FIGURE 6) results in de-energizing green lamp 92g and energizing red lamp 931' to thereby indicate opening of the stack breeching damper. 
 (3) Energization of start up dnaft fan, represented by lamps 103r vand 102g, is simulated by placing start up draft fan switch 2 in the on position and the FD fan discharge pressure switch 34 in the nomma position. Conventionally the start up draft fan is =a motor driven fan used to supply air for the combustion of iucl during the initial stamt up of the power plant when there is not suflicicnt steam available. Placing switch 2 (FIGURE 6) in the onv position de-energizesA green lamp 102g and energizes red lamp 1031l via contact 1a of switch 1 and Contact 2b of switch 2 to thereby indicate that the start up fan is energized. Further, placing switch 2 in the on position also energizes start up fan discharge relay SUFD via contact 1a of switch 1 and contact 2b of switch 2. Encrgization of the SUFD relay coil results in closure of the normally open SUFD contacts in the circuit off the PARO relay coil so as to thereby `set up a permissive for purging. Energization of 'the relay coil SUFD also results in opening the normally closed SUFD contacts in the PARR relay coil circuit so as to thereby de-energize or release one-half orf-thc parallel circuit oi the -PARR relay coil. Thus, upon placing either switch 31 or 32 in the high position, the PARR coil will be dc-energized. At this time in the sequence of operation it will be noted that all normal-ly closed SUFD contacts are closed and all normally lclosed SUFD contacts are open. Closure of switch 34 (FIGURE 7) by placing the lswitch in the norma position fle-energizes white lamp 98W and releases part oi the FT relay coilfoircuit. 
 (4) Placing a `diiierential across the economizer, represented by white lamp 99W, is simulated by positioning switch 33 in the high position. This simulates proper 1 l air flow through the boiler to setup a purge permissive for the initial light oli of the boiler to prevent furnace explosion. The differential is the result of flow through the tube section. 
 Positioning switch 33 (FIGURE 6) in the high position results in energizing white lamp 99W via the normally yopen contacts SUFD in the PARO Irelay coil circuit, which closed by virtue of step 3. Also, by so positioning switch 33 a second phase of establishing a purge permissive circuit has been established, as will be apparent from the description which follows. 
 (5) Purging of the system, represented by purge interlock white lamps 94W, 95W, 96W and 97W is simulated by positioning A and B purge switches 31 and 32 in the high position. White lamps 94W and `and 96W indicate low tair flow and white lamps 95W and 97w indicate high air flow. Purging is conwentionally lrequired in .the operation of la power plant to prevent boiler furnace explosions during :ini-tial light oli or during normal operation if insuicient combustion prevails. 
 Placing switches 31 and 32 in the high positions results in energizing white lamps 95W and 97W via previously closed contacts SUFD in the PARO relay coil circuit. Further, by so positioning switches 31 and 32 white lamps 94W yand 96W are de-energized. This also de-energ'izes relay coil PARR and energizes relay `coil lPARO of the PAR latch relay. De-energization of relay coil PARR results in opening of contacts PARR (FIGURE 7) to thereby de-energize white lamp 75W `and de-energize timer relay coil PART to thereby start purge time. Timing begins upon de-energization of relay coil PART. Further, by so positioning switches 31 and 32 all normally open PARR contacts are open and all normally closed PARR contacts are closed. Also by so positioning switches 31 and 32, the PARO normally open contacts are closed fand the PARO normally closed contacts are opened. Thus, for example, the PARO normally closed contacts in the mill and pilot torch circuit (FIGURE 7) are closed so as to establish a purge interlock for starting the mills and pilot torches. The purge timer relay coil PART will time out two minutes and thereafter be de-energ-ized so las tto render the normally open PART contacts in the FT relay coil circuit open to release part of ythe -parallel FT (Fuel Trip) relay coil circuit. 
 (6) Energization of A boiler feed pump, represented by `lamps 153g and 154i', is simulated by placing switch 21 in the on position. The turbine boiler feed pump A in a conventional power plant is provided to supply water to the boiler under normal operating conditions. For example, such a pump can supply approximately 60% of full load requirements. As shown in the llow diagram in portion A (FIGURE la) a second such pump B, represented by lamps 151g and 152r, is provided for full loading of the unit. By so positioning switch 21 (FIG- URE 6) lamp 153g is de-energized and lamp 154r is energized via a set of normally closed contacts 86-12 and contact 21c of switch 21. Further, by so positioning switch 21 a portion of the parallel circuit for the load limit runback, represented by switch 54, is opened. 
 (7) Energization of A, B, C, D boiler circulating pumps, respectively, represented by lamps 133g and 134r, 131g and 132r, 129g and 130r, 127g and 12-8r, is simulated by placing switches 16, 17, 1S and 19 in the on position and placing switch 38, the boiler circulating water differential switch in the normal position. The A, B, C and D boiler circulating pumps are conventionally located within the boiler circulating or ilow loop and are used to insure adequate ilow of water through all boiler wall tube areas to prevent burning out, or overheating of the tubes. Whereas four such pumps are represented in FIGURE l, three are usually su'icient for normal full load operation of `a power generating plant. By so positioning switches 16, 17, 18 and 19 (FIG- URE 5) lamps 133g,\131g, 129g, and 127g will respectively be de-energized and lamps 134r, 132r, 1301' and 1281l 12. will be energized to thereby indicate that the pumps are operating. By placing switch 38 (FIGURE 7) in the normal position, white lamp 135w will be deenergized and in addition a portion of the parallel circuit of the FT relay coil will be released. 
 At this stage in the sequence of operation, the FT (Fuel Trip) relay coil is completely de-energized. This is because switches 34 and 318 are now in their open or normal position yand switch 35 is in its open posi-tion, and the normally open contacts PART, HFPT, T and HLRT are open. Thus, -all normally closed FT contacts are now closed and 'all normally open FT contacts are no-w open. Thus, for example, in FIGURE 7, the normally closed FT contacts in the circuit of the oil solenoid switch 4 are now closed thereby establishing a permissive circuit for the fuel oil solenoid. IFurther, the normally open FT contacts in the circuit of the MT relay coil are now open so as to de-energize the MT relay coil. De-energization of relay coil MT results in opening the normally open relay contacts MT in the circuits of green lamps 112g, 110g, 106g and 104g, which represent mills A through E, respectively. Further, de-energization of relay coil MT closes normally closed contacts MT in the circuit of lamps 113r, 111r, 1091, 107r and 1051', respectively, representing pilot torches A through E (8) Opening of the main oil valve, represented by lamp-s r and 119g, is simulated by placing main fuel oil valve switch 4 in the open position. The main oil valve is conventionally -a master safety shut-off supply valve for the oil feeding the mill pilot vtorches and oil guns. By so positioning switch 4 (FIGURE 7) green lamp 119g .and white alarm lamp 74w are de-energized, lamp 120r is energized to indicate that the valve is open, and relay coil 630 is energized via norm-ally closed contacts FT tand 86-1-2. Thus, all normally open contacts 630 are closed and all norm-ally closed contacts 630 are open. For example, normally open contacts 630 in the circuit of red lamps 114r, 1151', 1116r, 117r and 118r are closed establishing a mill pilot torch permissive interlock. Further, energization of relay coil 630 opens normally closed contacts 630 in the circuit of boiler trip alarm lamp 73W. Still further, energization of relay coil 630 opens normally closed contacts 630 in the circuit of lamp 121g, representing oil guns. 
 (9) At this point in the sequence of operation, the simulator is now in condition to simulate ignition in the boiler. Ignition of the fuel oil gun, represented by lamps 121g and 122r, is simulated by placing oil gun switch 5 in the on position. Fuel oil guns, or burners, are used in la conventional power generating plant to initially warm up the boiler vand to keep coal burning conditions stabilized when operating with one mill, i.e., operating on one of a plurality of coal pulverizing and feeding means at low load conditions. By so positioning switch 5 (FIG- URE 7), green lamp 121g is de-energized and red lamp 122r is energized to indicate that the oil gun is 'openating and the fuel is burning. iFurther, by so positioning switch 5 red lamp 123r will be energized via normally open contacts `630 and PARO which were previously closed in steps 8 and 6, respectively. Red lamp 1231' represents that the oil pilot torch (FIGURE 1A) is operating. Still further, by so positioning switch 5 a permissive interlock for relay coil OGX is obtained by virtue of contact 5a of switch 5. Thus, upon placing any of the mill switches 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 to yan on position the relay coil OGX will be energized. 
 10) At this stage in the sequence of operation, the simulator is in condition to simulate operation of the turbo generator. Energization of the stator oil pumps, represented by lamps 178g and 1791', is simulated by placing switch 30 in the on position. Conventionally, such oil pumps are used to circulate cooling oil through the generator stator bar windings land to maintain a minimum expansion of material due to a temperature differential existing at various loads on the generator. By so posi- 13 tioning switch 30 (FIGURE 5), green lamp 178g is deenergized and red lamp 178r is energized via normally closed contacts 86-12 and contact 36h of switch 30. 
 In addition to so positioning the stator oil pump switch 30, simulation of the stator oil system should be made to indicate that the stator oil system is in a normal condition. High oil temperatures of the system are represented by lamp 175W, low oil pressure conditions of the system are represented by lamp 176W and low oil differential conditions of the system are indicated by lamp 177W. Simulation of norm-al conditions of the stator oil system is had by placing switches 51, 52 and S3 in their normal positi-ons. By so positioning swithes 51, 52 and 53 (FIGURE 5) white lamps 175W, 176W and 177W are deenergized so as to indicate that the stator oil system is in a normal condition. Further, 'by positioning the switches, timer relay coil 62-C1 and relay coil 62-C2 are de-energized. De-energization of timer coil 62C1 opens the normally open contacts 62-01 in the circuit of load limit runback cutoff switch 54 (FIGURE 5). De-energization of relay coil 62-C2 releases a portion of the parallel circuit of the load limit runback cutoi switch 54 by opening normally open contacts 62-C2 (FIGURE 6). 
 (11) Opening of the main stop valves, governor valves, intercept valves and reheat stop valves respectively represented by lamps 137g and 1381', 139g and 1401', 141g7 and 1421', 143g and 144r is simulated by respectively placing switches 23, 24, 2S and 26 in the open positions. Conventionallyall of these valves are part of a main turbine which drives the generator. The valves serve to control admission of steam from the boiler to the turbine, back to the boiler for reheating and then back to the tunbine once again, and to isolate the steam from the boiler during normal shut-downs or emergency trip outs. The valves are generally hydraulically operated from the main turbine hydraulic oil supply pumps. 
 By so positioning switches 23, 24, 25 and 26 (FIGURE 6), green lamps 137g, 139g, 143g and 141g will be deenergized and red lamps 138r, 140r, 144r and 1421 will be energizedvia a set of norm-ally closed contacts T in the circuit of the red lamps to thereby indicate that the valves are open. 
 (12) Synchronization of the generator by closing the generatorl breaker, represented by lamps 173g and 1741', is simulated by placing switch 27 `in the closed position. Conventionally in an electric generating plant the generator breaker is the main breaker used to connect the generator output to the lineload. It is also used to instantaneously cut off the generator from the line load in the event of electrical side faults or trouble to thereby protect the generator. 
 By so positioning switch 27 (FIGURE 5), green lamp 173g is de-energized and red lamp 1741' is energized via normally closed contacts 86-12. Further, by so positioning switch`27 relay coil 52A is energized via contact 27b of switch 27. Thus, all normally open contacts 52A are closed and all normally closed contacts 52A are opened. For example, the normal-ly open contactsSZA in the circuits of white lam-ps 162W, 163W, 136W are closed to thereby establish an interlocking circuit for unit trip white alarm lamp 91W in the event that simulation is later made of loss of excitation megawatts, or O steam flow by respectively placing switch 59 in the lost lposition and switches 60 and 40 in the 0 positions. The significance of such events will be more apparent lfrom the, description of simulated conditions and malfunctions which follows. 
 (13) At this state .in the sequence `of operation the simulator is in condition for simulating the starting of the A and B mills. Simulation of ignition of mill pilot torches A and B, respectively represented by lamps 1181' and 1171', is obtainedby placing switches 6 and 7 in the on position. Conventionally the mill pilot torches or ignitors A, 13, C, D, are small capacity oil burners used to ignite coal from the mill as it is fed into the furnace, or the larger capacity warm up oil burners. By so -positioning switches 6 and 7 (FIGURE 7) red lamps 1181A and 1171' are respectively energized via the normally open contacts 630 and PARO now closed by virtue of prior steps 8 and 5, to thereby indicate that the A and B pilot torches are ignited. Further, by so positioning switches 6 and 7 a permissive interlock is established for starting A and B mills represented by lamps 113r and 1111' respectively. 
(14) Starting of A and B mills, respectively represented by lamps 112g and 1131', and 110g and 1111', is 
simulated by placing switches 11 and 12 in the on position. Conventionally, the mills in an electric generating .plant are coal pulverizing equipment used to grind coal to a fine powder form and for blowing the powder form with air int-o the f-urnace. Five such mills: A, B, 0, D, E, are shown on display panel portion A of FIGURE 1 each, for example, simulating a mill having a capacity of approximately 24 tons .per hour. 
 By so positioning switches 11 and 12 (FIGURE 7) green lamps 112g and 110g are de-energized and red lamps 1131' and 1,11r are energized via a s et of normally closed contacts MT and the previously closed normally open contacts PARO, as well as by virtue of contacts 6b and 7b of switches 6 and 7, previously placed in the closed or on position in step 13. Further, by so positioning switches 11 and 12 the relay coil OGX will be energized via the now closed normally open contacts 630 and, PARO, contact 5a of -switch 5, lnow closed by virtue of step 9, and either of contacts 11e or 12C of switches 11 and 12.. Energization of relay coil OGX opens the normally closed contacts OGX in the circuit of the FTT-T and FIT-1 relay coils to thereby de-energize relay coils FTT-T and PTT-1 (the FT normally open contacts are now open by virtue of step 7 De-energization of -the FTT relay coils results in opening the normally open FTT thirty (30) minutes time delay contacts in the circuit of turbine trip alarm lamp 82W to thereby simulate a one-half hour fuel trip period. 
 (15) Starting of the main turbine driven fan, represented by lamps 100g and 1011', is simulated by placing switch 3 in the on position. Conventionally, the main turbine driven draft Vfan is a steam driven yfan used to supply air for combustion of fuel fed into the furnace. The amount of air fed is automatically controlled in relation to the fuel for maximum efiiciency. By so positioning switch 3 (FIGURE 6) green lamp 100g is deenergized and red lamp 101r is energized via normally closed contacts 86-12T and contact 1a of switch 1 (previously closed in step 2) to thereby indicate that the turbine driven fan is operating. Further, by so positioning switch 3, relay coil TDFD, connected in parallel with lamp 1011, is also energized. Thus, all normally open TDFD contacts are closed and all normally closed TDFD contacts are open. ForV example, the normally open TDFD contacts in the purge circuits represented by white lamps W, 97W and 99W are now closed. This permits shut-down of the startup fan represented by lamps 102g and 1031' since the above .mentioned set of normally opened TDFD contacts are in parallel with a set of normally open SUFD (start up fan driven) contacts in the same purge circuits. Further, by so positioning switch 3 the normally closed TDFD contacts in the circuit of the PARR relay coil are rendered open so as to thereby release a portion of the parallel circuit of the PARR relay coil. 
 (16) The simulator is now in condition to simulate shut down of the start up fan, represented by lamps 102g and 10317, the function of which was previously described .in step 3. Shut down of the start up fan is simulated by placing the switch 2 in the off position. By so positioning switch 2 (FIGURE 6), green lamp 102g is energized and red lamp 1l3r and relay coil SUFD are de-energized. 
 (17) The simulator is now in condition to simulate transferring of power from the start up transformer to the station service transformer by tripping the start up supply breaker, represented by lamps 171g and 1721 (previously described in step l), and closing the station service breaker, represented by lamps 169g and 1701', simulated by placing switch 28 in the closed position. Conventionally, the station `service breaker is an electrical power circuit breaker used to control power flow to the boiler turbine generator equipment from the main generator under normal operating conditions. This makes the unit self-sustaining, i.e., the main generator supplying power to its own auxiliary equipment. Further, in transferring to the station service transformer the start up supply breaker `switch 2.9 is .placed in the tripped position. By so positioning switches 28 and 29 (FIGURE 5), green lamp 169g and red lamp 1721' are de-energized and red lamp 170r and green lamp 171g are energized, the latter via a set of normally closed contacts 86-12 to indicate that power is now obtained from the station seivice transformer. 
 (18) At this stage in the sequence of operation, the simulator is in condition to `simulate complete full loading. Starting of the remaining mill pilot torches, i.e., C, D, E, respectively represented by red lamps 116r, 115r and 1141' (previously described in step 13), is simulated by placing switches 8, 9 and 10 in the on position. By so positioning switches 8, 9 and 1t) (FIG- URE 7) red lamps 1161', 1151' and 1141' are energized via the normally open contacts 630 and PARO, now closed by virtue of steps 8 and 5, respectively. 
 (19) Starting of the C, D and E mills, respectively represented by lamps 108g and 1091, 106g and 107r and 104g and 1051' (previously described in step 14), is simulated by placing switches 13, 14 and 15 in the on positions. By so positioning switches 13, 14 and 15 (FIGURE 7) green lamps 108g, 106g, and 104g are de-energized and red lamps 109r, 107r and 1051' are energized via the now closed normally open contacts 630 and PARO. 
 Starting of the second boiler feed pump B, represented by lamps 151g and 1521 (previously described in step 6), is simulated by placing switch 22 in the on position. By so positioning switch 22 (FIGURE 6) green lamp 151g is de-energized and red lamp 1521' is energized via a set of normally closed contacts 86-12 to thereby indicate that boiler feed pump B is operating. Further, by so positioning switch 22 a portion of the parallel circuit, i.e., contact 22a of switch 22, in the load limit runback circuit of contact 54b of switch 54 is released. 
 (21) Shut down of the oil gun and pilot torch, respectively represented by lamps 121g and 1221 and 1231' (previously described in step 9), and of the mill pilot torches A through E, respectively represented by lamps 1181, 1171', 1161', 115r and 114r (previously described in steps 13 and 18), is simulated by placing switches 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the olf positions. By so positioning switches 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (FIGURE 7), green lamp 121g is energized and red lamps 1141', 1151', 1161', 117r, 1181, 1221 and 1231' are de-energized to thereby indicate that the oil gun and the pilot torches are not operating. 
 At this stage in the operation sequence the simulator simulates that all conditions are normal for full loading of the power generating plant. Attention will now be directed toward simulation of conditions and malfunctions that might be encountered in the operation of such a plant due to, for example, component failure or lack of proper auxiliary equipment capacity. 
 At this stage in the operation, the simulator is in proper condition for simulating various conditions and malfunct-ions which might `occur during the operation of a power generating plant, as depicted in the graphic flow pattern CTI  16 display portion A of FIGURE 1. The simulated conditions and malfunctions are as follows: 
 (1) Loss of proper combustion air is represented by purge interlock white lamps 94W and 96W. Lamps 95W and 97W represent high air flow and lamps 94W and 96W represent low a-ir iiow. Conventionally, purge interlocks are provided to insure adequate scavenging of combustibles from the furnace before oil or coal is admitted and ignited. The primary purpose of purging is to prevent boiler furnace explosions during the initial light-off or dur-ing normal operation, if insufficient air prevails. 
 Loss of proper combustion air is simulated by placing A and B purge switches in the low positions. By so positioning switches 31 and 32 (FIGURE 6) white lamps W and 97W are de-energized and white lamps 94W and 96W are energized to indicate low air flow. Further, by so positioning switches 31 and 32, relay coil PARO is de-energized and relay coil PARR is energized via contact 32a of switch 32 and contact 31a of switch 31. Energization of relay coil PARR closes the normally open PARR contacts in the circuit of the PART timer relay coil (FIGURE 7) to thereby energize low air ilow alarm lamp 75W, and energize timer relay coil PART. Energization of low air ow alarm lamp 75w (alarm portion B of FIGURE 1) indicates that a state of insufficient combustion air is being supplied for the fuel fed to the boiler. The indication may also represent that a restriction of necessary air ow is developing in the furnace itself, or in the supply or discharge ducts, demanding maintenance inspection. 
 Energization of timer relay coil PART closes the normally open relay contacts PART in the circuit of relay coil FT (FIGURE 7) to thereby energize the relay coil FT and boiler trip alarm lamp 73w. Energization of boiler trip or fuel trip alarm lamp 73W (alarm portion B of FIGURE l) indicates that all mill motors are tripped and that the main fuel oil solenoid valve is closed not permitting the ow of fuel oil to both the mill pilot torches and the oil guns. 
 Energization of relay coil FT also closes the normally open contacts FT in the circuit of the FTT-T and FTI 1 relay coils (FIGURE 7) to thereby energize the FTT- T and FTT-1 coils. These relay coils are time delay relays representative of a thirty (30) minutes time delay, after which the normally open FTT contacts in the circuit of relay coil T and turbine trip alarm lamp 82W (FIG- URE 6) are closed to thereby energize relay coil T and alarm lamp 82W. Turbine trip alarm lamp 82W, when energized, indicates that all stop valves, control valves and intercept valves are closed, i.e., all turbine hydraulic control valves are closed preventing steam from entering the turbine. 
 Energization of relay coil FT opens the normally closed FT contacts in the circuit of relay coil 631) (FIG- URE 7) to thereby de-energize relay coil 630. De-energization of relay coil 630 causes the normally open contacts 630 in the circuit of pilot torch lamps 1141', 1151', 1161', 1171' and 1181' to be open, thereby de-energizing the pilot torch red lamps to ind-icate that the pilot torches are not operating. Further, de-energization of relay coil 630 closes the normally closed relay contacts 34) in the circuit of boiler trip alarm lamp 73W. If re-starting procedure is accomplished within one-half hour, i.e., going through purge sequence, wash out of the turbine trip will occur since, as previously described, the FTT-T relay coils simulate a thirty (30) minutes time delay before closure of the FTT contacts in the circuit of turbine trip relay coil T (FIGURE 6). 
 Energization of relay coil FT also closes the normally open contacts FT in the circuit of the relay coil MT to thereby energize relay coil MT. Energization of relay coil MT results in closure of the normally open contacts MT in the circuits of mill green lamps 104g,-106g, 108g, g and 112g (FIGURE 7) to thereby energize the mill green lamps indicating that the mills A through E are not operating. 
 (2) Fan discharge pressure low cond-ition, is represented by low air pressure lamp 98W. Simulation of fan discharge pressure low, which initiates fuel or boiler trip conditions, is obtained by placing switch 34 in the low posit-ion. By so positioning switch 34 (FIGURE 7) relay coil FT and lamp 98W are energized. Energization of relay coil FT produces the same effects and results as described in step B-l. 
 (3) Boiler circulating water differential pressure low condition, represented by lamp 135W, refers to the dif* ferential condition developed across the boiler circulating tube sections by the boiler circulating pumps. A low condition is simulated by placing switch 38 in the low position. By so positioning switch 38 (FIGURE 7) lamp 135W and relay coil FT are energized. Energization of relay coil FT produces the same effects and results as described in step B-l. 
 (4) One mill running without oil guns, represented by alarm lamp 72W, is the boiler trip condition in the pulverizing mill operation when the main oil solenoid is closed. This is simulated by placing switch 35 in the on position. By so positioning switch 35 (FIGURE 7) one mill running alarm lamp 72W, boiler trip alarm lamp 73W and relay coil FT are energized. Energization of the relay coil FT produces the same effects and results as described in step B-l. 
 (5) High furnace pressure trip condition, represented by lamp 124W, refers to high pressure in the furnace resulting from gases of combustion and the abnormal restricted flow of these gases to the stack. This condition is simulated by placing switch 39 in the high position. By so positioning switch 39 (FIGURE 7) white lamp 124W and timer relay coil HFPT are energized. Energization of timer relay coil HFPT closes the normally open HFPT contacts in the circuit of the FT relay coil to thereby energize the FT coil. Energization of relay coil FT produces the same effects and results as described in step B-l. 
 (6) High drum level condition, represented by lamp 125W, is indicative of the high water level in the steam drum of the boiler. The high level point being the level in the boiler drum which may cause adverse operating conditions such as carry-over of water with the stream to the superheater and turbine. This condition is simulated by placing switch 36 in the high position. By so positioning switch 36 (FIGURE 7) lamp 125W and relay coil DLH are energized. Energization of relay coil DLH results in the closure of the normally open contacts DLH in the circuit of relay coil T and turbine trip alarm lamp 82W (FIGURE 6) to thereby energize relay coil T and alarm lamp 82W. Energization of relay coil T results in closure of the normally open contacts T in the circuit of relay coil FT to thereby energize relay coil FT. Energization of relay coil FT produces the same effects and results as described in step B-l. 
 (7) Overspeed conditions of the turbine, represented by lamp 156W, refers to speed of approximately of 8 to 10% over normal conditions. Conventionally, the normal turbine speed is substantially 3,600 r.p.m. Overspeed is simulated by placing switch 5t) in the high position. By so positioning switch 5) (FIGURE 6) lamp 156W and relay coil T are energized. Energization of relay coil T produces the same effects and results as described in steps B-l and B-6. 
(8) Low vacuum condition, represented by lamp 158W, 
refers to a vacuum pressure inthe range of 18 to 20 inches Hg. Conventionally, the normal pressure to which steam from the turbine is exhausted to secure maximum energy is 28 inches Hg. Knowledge of a lower than normal vacuum pressure is necessary to protect the exhaust or low pressure sections of the turbine from over heating. 
 Low vacuum conditions are simulated by placing switch 49 in the low position. By so positioning switch 49 18 (FIGURE 6), lamp 158W and relay coil T are energized. Energization of relay coil T produces the same effects and results as described in steps B-l and B-6. 
 (9) Tripping of the turbine manual lever, represented by lamp 155W, refers to a lever conventionally located on the front end of the main turbine and used for manual emergency shut-down of the turbine. Simulation of tripping the manual lever is obtained by placing switch 47 in the trip position. By so positioning switch 47 (FIG- URE 6), lamp 155W and relay coil T are energized. Energization of relay coil T produces the same effects and results as described in steps B-6 and B-l. 
 (l0) Operation of the turbine trip remote pushbutton, represented by lamp 157W, refers to a remotely operated turbine tripping device which is similar in purpose to that of the manual lever, described in step B-9. The pushbutton, when actuated, serves to shut down the turbine by dumping the hydraulic oil and shutting all steam valves on the turbine. 
 Actuation of the turbine trip remote pushbutton is simulated by placing switch 46 in the trip position. By so positioning switch 46 (FIGURE 6) lamp 157W and relay -coil T are energized. Energization of relay coil T produces the same effects and results as described in steps B-6 and B-l. 
 (ll) Thrust bearing failure, represented by lamp 145W, refers to failure of the bearing on the main turbine generator unit used to maintain desired rotating spindle clearances. Excessive wear of the bearing could cause rubbing of the turbine blades resulting in a complete shut down of the unit. 
 Simulation of thrust bearing failure is obtained by placing switch 4S in the fail position. By so positioning switch 48 (FIGURE 6) lamp 145W and relay coil T are energized. Energization of relay coil T produces the same effects and results as described in steps B-6 and B-l. 
 (12) Reduction of generator load to 0 megawatts, represented by lamp 163W, is simulated by placing switch 6ft in the zero position. By so positioning switch 60 (FIGURE 5), if turbine trip relay coil T has been previously energized, as in steps B-l through B-ll, closure of the normally open contacts T along with closure of switch 60 energizes relay coil 86-12 and time delay relay coil SG-IZTT, and also alarm lamp 91W. Energization of unit trip alarm lamp 91W indicates that both the turbine and the boiler have been tripped and thereby the generator oil circuit breaker, voltage regulator, and the field breaker are tripped open. Further, such a unit trip indicates that selected plant auxiliaries are disconnected from the generator and transferred to the start up source of power. Also such a unit trip indicates that the drive turbines for the boiler feed pumps are tripped, and the drive turbine for the FD fans is tripped after a time delay. 
 Energization of time delay relay coil 86-12TT causes closure of normally open contacts 86-12TT in the circuit of relay coil 86-12T to thereby energize relay coil 86- 12T. Energization of relay coil 86-12T closes the normally open contacts 86-12T in the circuit of the turbine driven forced draft fan lamp 100g to thereby energize lamp 100g (FIGURE 6). Energization of relay coil 86-12T also opens the normally closed contacts 86-'12T in the circuit of turbine driven fan lamp 1011' and relay coil TDFD (FIGURE 6) to thereby de-energize lamp llllr and relay coil TDFD. De-energization of relay coil TDFD opens the normally open contacts TDFD in the circuit of purge lamps W, 99W and 97W. Further, de-energization of relay coil TDFD closes the normally closed contacts TDFD in the circuit of the PARR relay coil so that upon de-energization of relay coil SUFD energization of relay coil PARR will result. 
 Energization of rel-ay coil Sti-l2 (FIGURE 5) opens the normally closed contacts 86-12 in the circuit of generator breaker lamp 1741', station service breaker lamp 1701', start up supply breaker lamp 171g and stator oil pump lamp 1791' (FIGURE 5) as well as opening the normally closed contacts 8642 in the circuitsof boiler feed pump lamps A and B, i.e., lamps 1541' and 1521' (FIGURE 6) so as to de-energize these lamps.

 (22) Zero ste-am flow plus exhaust hood temperature at 225 F., represented by lamps 136W and 159W, refers to the dual conditions of no steam flow to the main turbine and the temperature of the last turbine section before the steam condenser, which is conventionally limited by design requirements to approximately 225 F. These conditions are simulated by placing switch 4G in the "0 position and placing switch 55 in the high position. By so positioning switches 40 and 5S (FIGURE 5), lamps 136W, 159W, `91W and relay coils 86-12 and 86-12TT are energized.

The regulator protects the turbine from possible carry over of water and rapid decay of boiler pressure and temperatures.
