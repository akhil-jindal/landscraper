FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to telematics systems for vehicles and, more particularly, to telematics systems which may provide driving instructions or directions to a driver of a vehicle or which may provide other controls to an accessory or system of the vehicle. The present invention also relates generally to vehicle seating adjustment systems and, more particularly, to vehicle seating adjustment systems with memory adjustment.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In-vehicle telematics systems or vehicle-based telematics systems, such as General Motor's ONSTARÂ®, Daimler's TELEAIDâ¢, Ford's RESCUÂ® or the like, are common in vehicles today. Such telematics systems involve a telecommunication link from the vehicle to an operator or a voice input system at a service center or the like external to the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle may connect or communicate with an operator at the service center to request directions to a targeted location. The service center may provide directions to the targeted location based on the known position of the vehicle, which may be given to the service center operator by the driver, or which may be known by the operator via a link to a global positioning system (GPS) of the vehicle.
However, in such concierge-type systems, typically all of the road names, exits to take, and directional headings/directions are given verbally by the service center operator to the driver all together while the driver is driving the vehicle. The driver is then typically expected to remember several directional driving instructions and often has difficulty in remembering the full directions. Although the driver may optionally remain on the line with the service center operator until the driver reaches the intended destination, which may take many minutes, such as ten, fifteen, twenty minutes or more, and/or the driver may call back to the service center for updated directions, these actions increase the cost of the service, since the service center typically charges for such calls.
Therefore, there is a need in the art for a navigation system that overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is intended to provide instructions or directions to a driver of a vehicle which are keyed or coded or linked to respective geographic locations, such that the particular instructions are provided in response to the geographic position of the vehicle at least generally corresponding to the particular geographic location associated with the particular instruction. The particular instructions are thus provided to the driver of the vehicle only when the geographic position of the vehicle is at or near the predetermined or preset waypoints or geographic locations corresponding to the respective particular instructions.
According to an aspect of the present invention, a navigation system for a vehicle includes a vehicle-based telematics system, a vehicle-based global positioning system and a control. The telematics system is operable to receive a user input and to download directional information from a remote source to the control of the vehicle in response to the user input (often, for instance, in ONSTARÂ®, the user input may be a request from the driver to the remote source or service center operator for directions to a particular destination) and an initial geographic position of the vehicle, such as typically determined by the vehicle-based global positioning system. The directional information comprises at least two instructions, with each instruction being coded to or associated with or linked to a respective geographic location or waypoint. The control is operable to provide an output corresponding to each of the at least two instructions in response to a then current geographic position of the vehicle. The control is operable to provide each instruction only when the then current geographic position of the vehicle at least generally matches or corresponds to the particular respective geographic location associated with the particular instruction.
For instance, a first instruction is typically downloaded that comprises information as to the initial geographic position and heading of the vehicle (e.g., âYou are now heading East on Maple Street. Continue until you reach Oak Road.â). A second instruction may then provide information as the vehicle approaches the appropriate turn or intersection or the like to take (e.g., âYou are now within two blocks of Oak Road. Prepare to turn Right at Oak Road.â). A subsequent instruction may then provide information as to the geographic position of the vehicle after the previous step has been completed (e.g., âYou are now heading South on Oak Road. Continue until you reach Elm Street.â). The output thus provides separate instructions or steps of the directional information, with each instruction coded to a particular geographic location and provided in response to the then current geographic position of the vehicle.
Also, if the driver of the vehicle does not correctly turn or passes an appropriate turn or the like, the control of the present invention knows this via an input from the in-vehicle or vehicle-based global positioning system. As a consequence, a warning instruction may be communicated to the driver indicating that the directions are not being appropriately followed (e.g., âYou have passed Oak Road. Please execute a U-Turn and proceed West on Maple Street to Oak Road and turn Left at Oak Road.â). Also, if the driver turns off a given road onto an incorrect road or otherwise strays from the given route, the control may communicate a similar warning or instruction to alert the driver that the vehicle is no longer traveling along the given route (e.g., âYou have left Maple Street, but are not on Oak Road. Return to Maple Street and continue East on Maple Street to Oak Road, then turn Right on Oak Road.â).
The control is operable to tag or code each of the instructions with a respective geographic location or waypoint (alternately, each of the instructions may be tagged or coded or associated with a respective geographic location or waypoint at the remote source before downloading to the control of the vehicle, without affecting the scope of the present invention). The control is then operable to only display a particular instruction when the geographic location tagged or coded to the particular instruction matches or generally matches the actual, then current geographic position of the vehicle.
The control also receives, preferably continuously, an input from the vehicle-based global positioning system that is indicative of the actual, current geographic position of the vehicle as the vehicle travels along the road, highway or the like. The control is then operable to compare the tagged or coded geographic location (as associated with the respective instructions) with the GPS-derived actual geographic position information. Thus, the control may determine when a particular instruction is appropriate to be displayed and/or communicated to the driver by determining that the GPS-derived actual geographic position of the vehicle is now at or at least close to the geographic location associated with a particular instruction.
The user input may comprise a vocal input from the driver of the vehicle to the remote source or service center, or may comprise a keypad input or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention. Preferably, the geographic position of the vehicle is provided to the remote source (such as a service center or the like) via the global positioning system of the vehicle and the telematics system of the vehicle.
In one form, the output of the control is provided to the driver as an audible message. In another form, the output of the control is provided to the driver as a visible display. The visible display may comprise a video display element, an alphanumeric or iconistic display element or the like, and may comprise a display on demand type display element, a thin film transistor liquid crystal display element, a multi-pixel display element, and/or a multi-icon display element and/or the like. In another form, a combination of a visible and audible output may be used.
Optionally, the system may include a seat adjustment system that is operable to adjust a seat of the vehicle in response to data received via at least one of the vehicle-based telematics system and the vehicle-based global positioning system. The seat adjustment system may be operable in response to biometric data pertaining to the occupant of the seat of the vehicle.
According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for providing navigational directions to a driver of a vehicle comprises accessing a remote source or service center via a vehicle-based wireless communication system and downloading local information from the remote source to a control of the vehicle via the wireless communication system in response to a user input. The local information comprises at least two driving instructions. Each of the at least two driving instructions is associated with or linked to a respective, particular geographic location. A current geographic position of the vehicle is provided to the control via a vehicle-based global positioning system. Each of the at least two driving instructions is provided by the control to the driver in response to the then current geographic position of the vehicle and only when the current geographic position of the vehicle at least generally matches or corresponds to the particular geographic location electronically associated with or linked to the respective one of the at least two driving instructions.
Preferably, the method includes associating or tagging or coding or linking (such as electronically, digitally or the like) each of the instructions with a respective particular geographic location. The control may tag or code the instructions to be associated with the respective geographic locations after the instructions have been downloaded, or the remote service center may tag or code the instructions to be associated with the respective geographic locations before downloading the instructions to the control, without affecting the scope of the present invention.
In one form, the at least two driving instructions are visibly displayed to the driver at a display of the vehicle. In another form, the at least two driving instructions are audibly communicated to the driver via at least one speaker of the vehicle. In a third form, a combination of a visible display and audible communication may be used.
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a navigation system for a vehicle comprises a vehicle-based telematics system, a vehicle-based global positioning system, and a control. The telematics system is operable to receive a user input from a driver of the vehicle and to download directional information to the control of the vehicle in response to the user input and an initial geographic position of the vehicle. The directional information comprises at least two instructions. The control is operable to tag or code or link each of the instructions with a respective geographic location. The control is operable to provide an output corresponding to a particular instruction only when the geographic location tagged or coded or linked to the particular instruction at least generally corresponds to the actual current geographic position of the vehicle.
The present invention thus provides for step-by-step instructions or driving directions to the driver of a vehicle as the driver is driving the vehicle according to the instructions. Each step or instruction is provided either after the previous step or instruction has been completed or as the vehicle approaches a turn or intersection or location where the next step is to be performed, so that the driver is not overwhelmed with multiple instructions to remember as the driver drives the vehicle toward the targeted destination. The control or the remote source or service center is operable to electronically or digitally or otherwise tag, key, code or otherwise associate each instruction or step with a geographic location or waypoint, and the control is operable to only display that instruction when the geographic location tagged to the instruction generally matches the actual, current geographic position of the vehicle. All of the instructions are provided or downloaded to the vehicle during a single, short communication with the remote source or service center via the telematics system, so as to avoid multiple communications to the remote service center or a lengthy communication with the remote service center, thereby reducing the cost of the instruction service to the driver of the vehicle.
These and other objects, advantages, purposes, and features of the present invention will become more apparent from the study of the following description taken in conjunction with the drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a navigation system 10 of a vehicle 12 includes a control 14 which is operable to communicate an output 16, such as step-by-step directions or driving instructions, to a driver of the vehicle based on an initial, current or present geographic position of the vehicle and the desired or targeted final destination of the vehicle (FIGS. 1 and 2). The initial geographic position of the vehicle and the targeted destination is communicated to a remote source or service center 20 via a telematics system 18 of the vehicle and a global positioning system 22 of the vehicle. In response to a user input 24 from the driver or other occupant of the vehicle and the initial geographic position of the vehicle, the service center 20 provides or downloads a set of instructions or driving directions 26, which is received by the control 14 from the service center via the telematics system or wireless communication system 18 of the vehicle. Each of the particular instructions is electronically or digitally or otherwise coded, tagged, keyed, or otherwise associated with a respective particular geographic location or waypoint. The control 14 then provides the instructions or output 16 to the driver in a step-by-step manner based on the GPS-derived, actual, then current geographic position of the vehicle, and with the stepping from one step to the subsequent step of the instructions being linked to the then current geographic position of the vehicle in relation to the particular geographic locations or waypoints associated with the instructions, as discussed below.
The driver or the other occupant of the vehicle provides the user input 24 to the telematics system or wireless communication system 18 of the vehicle. The user input 24 may include a vocal communication or request for driving instructions or directional information to the final destination to an operator or voice input/recognition system of the service center or the like 20 associated with the telematics system 18 of the vehicle, or may be a keyed-in request or instructions via a keypad or the like to a remote computer system or computerized service center or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The driver or other occupant of the vehicle may provide (such as via a vocal communication or via a keypad input or the like) the initial position of the vehicle to the service center or the geographic position of the vehicle may be communicated to the service center via a global positioning system 22 of the vehicle.
The remote service center 20 is then operable to download the local map and/or the driving instructions or directions to a memory storage or control 14 of the vehicle while the communication link is open between the service center and the vehicle. Because only the local information necessary to direct the driver to the targeted destination is downloaded to the control or memory of the vehicle, the download may be completed in a relatively short period of time (thus minimizing the time and cost of the communication) and does not require a large amount of memory or storage space for the information. After the instructions or directions are downloaded to the vehicle, the driver may disconnect from the service center to avoid additional charges for the communication and service.
Each of the output instructions provided by the control is electronically or digitally or otherwise keyed or coded or tagged or otherwise associated with or linked to a respective or corresponding geographic location or waypoint. The instructions may be tagged or coded by the remote source or service center before the instructions are downloaded to the vehicle, or the instructions may be tagged or coded by the control at the vehicle after the instructions have been downloaded to the control, without affecting the scope of the present invention.
The control 14 also receives, preferably continuously, an input from the in-vehicle or vehicle-based global positioning system 22 which is indicative of the actual, current geographic position of the vehicle as it travels along the road, highway or the like. The control is then operable to compare the tagged or coded geographic locations as associated with the respective instructions with the GPS-derived actual geographic position information. Thus, the control is operable to determine when a particular instruction is appropriate to be displayed or communicated to the driver of the vehicle by determining that the actual GPS-derived geographic position of the vehicle is now at or at least close to the geographic location associated with a particular instruction. The control is then operable to provide the separate or particular output instructions to the driver of the vehicle in response to the actual, then current geographic position of the vehicle matching or corresponding to or approaching a particular geographic location or waypoint keyed to or coded to or tagged to or associated with a respective, particular instruction.
Preferably, the output or instructions are provided to the driver of the vehicle in a step-by-step manner, where each individual instruction or step is provided based on the then current geographic position of the vehicle with respect to the keyed or coded geographic location. More particularly, each particular instruction is provided to the driver by the control only when the actual geographic position of the vehicle at least generally corresponds to or matches the particular geographic location associated with or linked to the respective, particular instruction. The particular instruction is thus provided to the driver of the vehicle at the particular time at which the vehicle is positioned at or near a geographic location where the particular instruction is most useful to the driver of the vehicle.
For example, an initial instruction may be electronically or digitally coded to the initial geographic position of the vehicle when the directions/instructions are first requested (e.g., âYou are heading East on First Streetâ). Each subsequent individual step may be provided in response to the control detecting or determining (in response to an output of the global positioning system) that the vehicle is approaching, at or near the next geographic location or waypoint, such as a turn, location, intersection or the like, at which the next step is to be performed (e.g., the car is approaching and within a predetermined or threshold distance from Main Street and the next instruction is âTurn Left on Main Streetâ), or in response to the control detecting or determining (again in response to the global positioning system of the vehicle) that a previous instruction or step has been completed (e.g., the car has turned left and is now traveling along Main Street and the next instruction is âProceed North on Main Streetâ). The control is thus operable to provide the next step or instruction only when the driver can readily understand the instruction and focus on performing that particular step. The driver thus does not have to remember all of the multiple steps or turns or street names or exits or the like while also driving the vehicle. The driver also thus does not have to remain on the line with the remote service center operator and/or does not have to repeatedly contact the service center to obtain the instructions again if any of the instructions are forgotten, since the local instructions and/or map have been downloaded to the vehicle.
The telematics system or wireless communication system 18 of the vehicle may be operable to connect to a corresponding service center or operator or voice input/recognition system or the like 20 which may provide a variety of information or assistance to the driver of the vehicle in response to a vocal message from the driver or other occupant of the vehicle (although the user input may be a keypad input or the like to a computerized service center or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention). Such a communication system and service center may be substantially similar to known systems and centers, such as General Motors' ONSTARÂ®, Daimler's TELEAIDâ¢, Ford's RESCUÂ® or the like, which are common in vehicles today. The communication link may be accomplished utilizing various linking principles, such as the principles disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,420,975; 6,278,377; 6,243,003; 6,329,925; 6,428,172; 6,326,613, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
The driver or occupant of the vehicle may actuate a communication link (such as via a push button or the like at the interior rearview mirror or at a console of the vehicle), and request from the operator, such as via a voice input, the driving instructions or directions as to how to get to a desired or targeted location or destination. The service center may receive the initial geographic position of the vehicle (such as in response to the global positioning system of the vehicle or from the driver), and may access a database to obtain the appropriate local map and/or local directions to the targeted destination. The operator may even access the vast data banks available at the service center for destinations or locations and may provide human interaction to help find the destination of choice if the driver does not know the exact address. The operator or service center then downloads the local information or step-by-step or turn-by-turn directions 26 to the control or memory or storage system 14 of the vehicle 12 in a single download. Optionally, it is envisioned that the service center may download or provide the information to the vehicle in real time (which may result in a longer opened communication link between the vehicle and the service center), without affecting the scope of the present invention.
The control 14 is operable to provide the downloaded instructions to the driver of the vehicle while the vehicle is driven by the driver toward the targeted destination. The control 14 provides the information or directions or output 16, such as when/where to turn, how far until the turn, and the direction to travel, to the driver as needed. The control may be operable to update the output display or message in real time based on the current geographic position of the vehicle as the vehicle travels along the given route.
The output or instructions may be provided to the driver by the control via an audible message or signal, such as via one or more speakers of the vehicle, such as by utilizing principles of audio systems of the types disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,243,003; 6,278,377 and 6,420,975, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, or may be provided via a display, such as in a display of an interior rearview mirror 28, such as a scrolling display of the type disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/799,414, filed Mar. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,477,464, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, or a display on demand type display, such as the types disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,663 and 5,724,187, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/054,633, filed Jan. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,381; and Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, or in a display screen or the like at the interior rearview mirror assembly or elsewhere within the vehicle, without affecting the scope of the present invention. Other types of visible displays or locations for such visible displays may be utilized, such as at an accessory module or pod or windshield electronic module, an instrument panel of the vehicle, a console of the vehicle and/or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The visible display may comprise written instructions, icons (such as left and right arrows or the like), or any other characters or symbols or indicia which convey to the driver of the vehicle when/where to turn and/or which direction to travel in order to arrive at the targeted destination. Optionally, the output may comprise a combination of a visible display and an audible message or signal, without affecting the scope of the present invention.
As indicated above, a variety of means may be utilized to visually convey the direction instructions to the driver of the vehicle. For example, and such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/799,414, filed Mar. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,477,464, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, a text display may be provided and/or an iconistic display may be provided, such as a display readable through the interior rearview mirror reflective element itself. In this regard, use of a display on demand (DOD) type display (such as disclosed in commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/054,633, filed Jan. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,381, and Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,663 and 5,724,187, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein), may be preferred. For example, a video display element or a video display screen or an information display element can be used (such as an elongated alphanumeric/multi-pixel/multi-icon display element and/or such as an LCD display or an emitting display element, such as a multi-pixel electroluminescent display or field emission display or light emitting diode display (organic or inorganic) or the like) which is disposed within the mirror housing of the interior mirror assembly of the vehicle, and located behind the mirror reflective element in the mirror housing, and configured so that the information displayed by the display element (that is positioned to the rear of the reflector of the mirror reflective element) is viewable by the driver through the mirror reflective element. Such a display can be accomplished by partially or wholly removing the reflector in the area of the display or, more preferably, by providing a display on demand type display, whereby the reflective element comprises a transflective element, as discussed below.
Preferably, and such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, the video display screen or other visible display element or elements may be disposed behind the mirror reflective element so that the information displayed is visible by viewing through the mirror reflective element of the interior rearview mirror assembly, with the reflective element preferably comprising a transflective mirror reflector such that the mirror reflective element is significantly transmitting to visible light incident from its rear (i.e. the portion furthest from the driver in the vehicle), with at least about 15% transmission preferred, at least about 20% transmission more preferred, and at least about 25% transmission most preferred, while, simultaneously, the mirror reflective element is substantially reflective to visible light incident from its front (i.e. the position closest to the driver when the interior mirror assembly is mounted in the vehicle), with at least about 60% reflectance preferred, at least about 70% reflectance more preferred, and at least about 75% reflectance most preferred.
Preferably, a transflective electrochromic reflective mirror element is used (such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268; and/or in U.S. Pat.

With the likes of a TFT LCD video display or a light emitting information display disposed behind the rear substrate of a third-surface transflective electrochromic mirror reflective element in a âdisplay-on-demandâ configuration (such as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/054,633, filed Jan. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,381, and Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference), the presence of (and the image or information displayed by) the video display screen or information display is only principally visible to the driver (who views the display through the transflective mirror reflective element) when the information display element is powered so as to transmit light from the rear of the mirror reflective element through the transflective mirror reflector to reach the eyes of the driver. Preferably, a single high-intensity power LED, such as a white light emitting LED comprising a Luxeonâ¢ Star Power LXHL-MW1A white light emitting LED having (at a 25 degree Celsius junction temperature) a minimum forward voltage of 2.55 volts, a typical forward voltage of 3.42 volts, a maximum forward voltage of 3.99 volts, a dynamic resistance of 1 ohm and a forward current of 350 milliamps, and as available from Lumileds Lighting LLC of San Jose, Calif., is used as a backlight for the TFT LCD video screen. Alternately, a plurality of such single high-intensity power LEDs (such as an array of two or of four such power LEDs) may be placed behind the TFT LCD video screen so that the intense white light projected from the individual single high-intensity power LEDs passes through the TFT LCD element and through the transflective electrochromic element, preferably producing a display intensity as viewed by the driver of at least about 200 candelas/sq. meter; more preferably at least about 300 candelas/sq. meter; and most preferably at least about 400 candelas/sq. meter. Alternately, cold cathode vacuum fluorescent sources/tubes can be used for backlighting and optionally can be used in conjunction with LED backlighting.
Optionally, and in accordance with incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, a reverse-aid rearward viewing camera can be mounted to the rear of the vehicle in order to display to the driver, upon selecting a reverse gear, a field of view immediately rearward of the vehicle so as to assist the driver in reversing the vehicle. Such vehicle reverse-aid camera systems are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/313,139, filed May 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,447; Ser. No. 09/776,625, filed Feb. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,611,202.
Note that other display locations are possible for display of the video image or information display, such as a map and/or a text message comprising driving instructions, to the driver or occupant of the vehicle. For example, a video image may be displayed on an LCD video screen of flip-down display (such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, incorporated above), or on a video screen incorporated into the rearview mirror assembly, such as the type disclosed in U.S. provisional applications, Ser. No. 60/439,626, filed Jan. 13, 2003; Ser. No. 60/489,812, filed Jul. 24, 2003; and Ser. No. 60/492,225, filed Aug. 1, 2003, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Optionally, for example, a video display located in the front instrument panel can be used, or a video display located in an overhead console (such as an overhead accessory module or system as described in U.S. provisional applications, Ser.

Alternately, as outlined above, a local area map may be downloaded to the control from the external service provider or service center and the control may be operable (such as by using the principles disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/054,633, filed Jan. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,381, and Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference) to feed such a map to the likes of a thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal (LC) video screen or other type of video screen or display element or display system, and with the instructions being conveyed by alphanumeric characters and/or indicia or the like and/or by highlighting portions of the map display. Such highlighting may be controlled by the in-vehicle control or control unit based on actual, current vehicle position information as determined by the in-vehicle or vehicle-based global positioning system. Thus, the vehicle owner need not buy into or have in the vehicle a full map of all areas to which the vehicle may be driven (such as regional maps or national maps or the like).
Alternately, a low cost, multi-pixel display (such as the type disclosed in U.S. provisional application, Ser. No. 60/373,932, filed Apr. 19, 2002, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/418,486, filed Apr. 18, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,005,974, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference), such as a low cost multi-pixel vacuum fluorescent display, a low cost multi-pixel organic light emitting diode (OLED), a low cost multi-pixel field emission display, or any other or similar multi-pixel light emitting display or the like may be utilized, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The local area map, with the instructions iconistically displayed thereon, may be displayed on such a multi-pixel display or the like in response to the control receiving an input or download from the telematics system and/or the in-vehicle or vehicle-based global positioning system.
As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/054,633, filed Jan. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,381, incorporated above, suitable LEDs for a light source unit include a white light emitting light emitting diode, such as described in U.S. provisional applications, Ser. No. 60/263,680, filed Jan. 23, 2001; Ser. No. 60/243,986, filed Oct. 27, 2000; Ser. No. 60/238,483, filed Oct. 6, 2000; Ser. No. 60/237,077, filed Sep. 30, 2000; Ser. No. 60/234,412, filed Jul. 21, 2000; Ser. No. 60/218,336, filed Jul. 14, 2000; and Ser. No. 60/186,520, filed Mar. 2, 2000, and U.S. utility applications entitled VIDEO MIRROR SYSTEMS INCORPORATING AN ACCESSORY MODULE, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, and REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, Ser. No. 09/585,379, filed Jun. 1, 2000, including a thermostable LED, which emits the same color light even when the temperature varies. Thus, regardless of the interior or exterior temperature of the vehicle and/or of the accessory equipped with the thermostable non-incandescent light emitting diode source, the same color light is radiated. Such a thermostable white light emitting non-incandescent light emitting diode source can incorporate a trio of red, green, and blue fluorescent materials that together create white light when struck by 380 nm wavelength light from a gallium-nitride LED, and is available from Toyoda Gosei Co. and Toshiba Corp of Nagoya, Japan.
One suitable white light emitting diode (LED) that is thermostable is available from Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. of Irvine, Calif., Part No.: TLWA1100. The thermostable white-light LED integrates multiple colored phosphors and a short peak wavelength (preferably, approximately 380 nanometers (nm) in peak spectral output intensity) light-emitting diode junction in a phosphor-mixed transparent resin package to achieve a high luminosity, low power consumption light source. Such thermostable LEDs adopt a technological approach differing from that used in conventional LEDs. Light emission in the visible wavelength band is controlled by excited phosphors, not by using temperature changes in the LED to achieve a change in color output. The fact that the LED emission does not directly determine the color brings advantages in overall controllability and wavelength stability. Incorporated in vehicular accessories, such as those disclosed above, the thermostable diode achieves improved tonic reproduction and enhanced color durability during temperature shifts. Such thermostable LEDs utilize a short wavelength light source by reducing the indium in an indium-doped GaN emission layer. This excites red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphors in the transparent resin of the device package to output white light. The RGB balance of the phosphor layer determines the output color, and different colored output can be achieved through modified phosphor balance. The emission light from the LED itself does not directly contribute to the white color. The phosphors used in the new LED offer excellent performance in terms of operating temperature range and color yield. Specifications of such thermostable white LEDs include a compact package (3.2Ã2.8 millimeter), provided in a Surface Mount Device (SMD). Luminosity is typically about 100 millicandela (mcd) at 20 mA and luminous flux/electrical watt is about 4.5-5.0 lumens per watt at 20 mA. Correlated color temperature is about 6,500-9,000 K. Operating temperature is about â40Â° Celsius-100Â° Celsius and storage temperature is about â40Â°-100Â° Celsius.
Also, high brightness LEDS are available from Uniroyal Technology Corporation of Saratoga, Fla. under the tradename POWER-Ga(I)â¢ High Brightness InGaN LEDs which comprise high brightness, high luminous efficiency short wavelength LEDs utilizing a power ring n-Contact and a centralized p-Pad design feature. 450 nm and 470 nm high brightness blue LED die products are available that have a minimum power output of 2 milliwatts in die form which, when conventionally packaged, can result in packaged lamp power levels between 4 and 5 milliwatts. Such LEDs combine indium gallium nitride (InGaN) materials on sapphire substrates in order to produce higher efficiencies. GaN LEDs can be produced by MOCVD epitaxy on Sapphire (aluminum oxide) or can be produced on silicon carbide substrates. Ultraviolet light emitting LEDs can be produced.
Depending on the application, LEDs emitting a colored light can be used, such as high intensity amber and reddish orange light emitting diode sources, such as solid state light emitting diode LED sources utilizing double hydro junction AlGaAs/GaAs Material Technology, such as very high intensity red LED lamps (5 mm) HLMP-4100/4101 available from Hewlett Packard Corporation of Palo Alto, Calif., or transparent substrate aluminum indium gallium phosphide (AlInGaP) Material Technology, commercially available from Hewlett Packard Corporation of Palo Alto, Calif. Also, blue can be used, or a combination of individual different colored diodes, such as red, blue, white, green, amber, orange etc. can be used with color mixing thereof to form a desired color or to deliver a desired local intensity of illumination as noted above. Other suitable white emitting light-emitting diodes are available from Nichia Chemical Industries of Tokyo, Japan and from Cree Research Inc., of Durham, N.C. For example, a white light emitting diode is available from Nichia Chemical Industries of Tokyo, Japan under Model Nos. NSPW 300AS, NSPW 500S, NSPW 310AS, NSPW 315AS, NSPW 510S, NSPW 515S and NSPW WF50S, such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/448,700, filed Nov. 24, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,925, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/244,726, filed Feb. 5, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,613. A variety of constructions are used including GaAsP on GaP substrate, gallium aluminum phosphide, indium gallium nitride, and GaN on a SiC substrate. Optionally, a plurality of LEDs such as a cluster of two, three, four, six, eight or the like LEDs (each of the same color or the cluster comprising different colored LEDs) can be used to target and illuminate a local area for higher illumination at that area, such as may be useful in a map light or as a reading light or as an interior light or as an illumination source for an interior vehicle cabin-mounted and monitoring camera (most preferably illuminating the target area with white light). Such a cluster of high efficiency LEDs can be mounted at the mirror mount so as to project an intense pattern of light generally downwardly into the vehicle cabin for purposes of map reading, general illumination, courtesy illumination and the like. Also, a cluster of LED's, preferably including at least one white emitting LED and/or at least one blue emitting LED, can be mounted in a roof portion, side portion or any other portion of the vehicle cabin to furnish dome lighting, rail lighting, compartment lighting and the like. Use of white emitting LEDs is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,152,590, entitled LIGHTING DEVICE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES, filed Feb. 12, 1999, by Peter Fuerst and Harald Buchalla of Donnelly Hohe Gmbh & Co, KG.
Other suitable LEDs may include high-intensity, high current capability light emitting diodes such as the high-flux power LEDs available from LumiLeds Lighting, U.S., LLC of San Jose, Calif. under the SunPower Series High-Flux LED tradename. Such high-intensity power LEDs comprise a power package allowing high current operation of at least about 100 milliamps forward current, more preferably at least about 250 milliamps forward current, and most preferably at least about 350 milliamps forward current through a single LED. Such high current/high-intensity power LEDs (as high as 500 mA or more current possible, and especially with use of heat sinks) are capable of delivering a luminous efficiency of at least about 1 lumen per watt, more preferably at least about 3 lumens per watt, and most preferably at least about 5 lumens per watt. Such high intensity power LEDs are available in blue, green, blue-green, red, amber, yellow and white light emitting forms, as well as other colors. Such high-intensity LEDs can provide a wide-angle radiation pattern, such as an about 30 degree to an about 160 degree cone. Such high-intensity power LEDs, when normally operating, emit a luminous flux of at least about 1 lumen, more preferably at least about 5 lumens and most preferably at least about 10 lumens. For certain applications such as ground illumination from lighted exterior mirror assemblies and interior mirror map lights, such high-intensity power LEDs preferably conduct at least about 250 milliamps forward current when operated at a voltage in the about 2 volts to about 5 volts range, and emit a luminous flux of at least about 10 lumens, more preferably at least about 15 lumens and most preferably at least about 25 lumens, preferably emitting white light.

No. 60/234,412, filed Sep. 21, 2000; Ser. No. 60/218,336, filed Jul. 14, 2000; and Ser. No. 60/186,520, filed Mar. 2, 2000, all commonly assigned.
The video screen may be used for a baby minder system, such as the vehicle interior monitoring system described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,897 and 5,760,962 or the rear vision system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642, and Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610, and Ser. No. 09/433,467, filed Nov. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,613. An interior surveillance system permits the driver of the vehicle to observe behavior or the activities of babies or children or other passengers seated in the rear seat. This is especially advantageous when the child or baby is in a rearward facing car seat, where the child or baby would ordinarily not be visible to the driver while driving. For example, a camera, such as a CMOS or CCD camera, can be mounted to view the rear seat area of the vehicle so that the driver can view what is occurring, such as in a rear seat mounted baby seat or with a rear seat passenger, such as children. Preferably, to enable viewing of the rear seat occupant or occupants even by night, the target field of view of the camera may be illuminated in a manner that provides adequate visibility for the camera to discern what is occurring in the rear seat in a darkened vehicle cabin but not illuminating in a manner that causes glare, distraction, and/or discomfort to any vehicle occupants, including the driver and/or rear seat passengers. For example, such a rear seat monitoring camera illumination is preferably achieved using directed low level non-incandescent light sources, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light emitting material, electroluminescent sources (both organic and inorganic), and the like, and most preferably such non-incandescent sources are low power and are directed low intensity sources, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,321 and application Ser. No. 09/287,926, filed Apr. 7, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,172. The baby minder camera may be mounted as a part of the rearview mirror assembly and, most preferably, may be mounted as a part of a roof area of the interior vehicle cabin such as a header, including a front header of a roof or a rear header or a header console of a roof. It may be desirable to mount a baby minder camera to the rear header of a roof when it is desirable to view rear facing child support seats. Most preferably, a plurality of at least two, more preferably at least four, and most preferably at least six LEDs (or similar low level, directed, low-current light sources such as electroluminescent sources and organic light emitting sources) are mounted with a camera (preferably, such as to form a ring around the camera) with the light projected from the individual LEDs directed to be coincident with the camera field of view and to illuminate the target area desired to be viewed. The LEDs being directed low level sources will not glare or cause discomfort to occupants when illuminated. Further, camera illumination sources can be illuminated whenever the ignition switch is on to operate the vehicle or at least when the ignition switch is placed in an âaccessory onâ position so that both the camera and illumination lights are operating on vehicle battery power even when parked. Alternately, the illumination lights can be operational only when the baby minder camera is selected to be operational. While it is preferred to use non-incandescent lights, incandescent light sources can be used, most preferably high intensity, low current incandescent light sources. For example, when the camera is activated to view the rear seat or to view a baby seat or the like, the dome light in the vehicle, which typically comprises an incandescent light source, can illuminate so that the rear seat area is illuminated to assist visibility for the camera. A circuit or other device can be provided that illuminates the dome light (or a similar rear seat-illuminating interior light source, such as a rail lamp or the like) whenever the camera is selected to view the rear seat. Optionally, the dome light or similar interior light within the interior cabin, once caused to illuminate when the camera is activated, can cease to illuminate after a determined time interval (such as 5 seconds or ten seconds or longer) under the control of a timeout circuit or device. By providing a timeout, the driver can selectively view the status of passengers in the rear seat of the vehicle by selecting a baby-minder camera or similar rear seat viewing function (such as by voice command, user-operated switch or the like). Upon selection of the camera function, whatever is being viewed on the video screen in the vehicle may be interrupted (or superimposed over or the like), the interior light in the cabin (such as the dome light) will illuminate, a timeout will initiate, and the driver (or other front-seat occupant) can view the rear seat status for the duration of the timeout. Once the timeout elapses, the interior light ceases to illuminate, and preferably, the camera ceases to be activated and the video screen reverts to its pre-event status. Optionally, a reverse-aid rearward viewing camera can be mounted to the rear of the vehicle in order to display to the driver, upon selecting a reverse gear, a field of view immediately rearward of the vehicle so as to assist the driver in reversing the vehicle. Such vehicle reverse-aid camera systems are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/313,139, filed May 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,447.
Light emitting sources, such as light emitting diodes, can be used to provide lighting for any camera that feeds an image to the mirror-mounted video screen (or feeds an image to an accessory module assembly such as a windshield electronics module assembly). Light emitting diodes can be used to provide illumination in various colors, such as white, amber, yellow, green, orange red, blue, or their combination, or the like, may be used. Alternately, other light emitting elements can be used to provide illumination for any camera that feeds an image to the mirror-mounted video screen, such as incandescent sources, fluorescent sources, including cold-cathode fluorescent sources, electroluminescent sources (both organic and inorganic), such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,321, and application Ser. No. 09/287,926, filed Apr. 7, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,172, and in such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466,010, filed Dec. 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,975, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/449,121, filed Nov. 24, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,428,172, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/585,379, filed Jun. 1, 2000, entitled REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS.
The mirror-mounted video screen can display the output from a rear vision back-up camera, such as disclosed in application Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610, and Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642, commonly assigned, along with vehicle instrument status, such as a vehicle information display, such as information relating to fuel gauge levels, speed, climate control setting, GPS directional instructions, tire pressure status, instrument and vehicle function status, and the like.
Also, and especially for a mirror assembly incorporating a video screen that is incorporated as part of an interior electro-optic (such as electrochromic) mirror assembly, a common circuit board and/or common electronic components and sub-circuitry can be utilized to control the electro-optic activity of the reflective element and to control the image displayed by the video screen, thus achieving economy of design and function, and for operating other electrical or electronic functions supported in the interior rearview assembly. For example, a circuit board of the interior mirror assembly may support, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs) for illuminating indicia on display elements provided on a chin or eyebrow portion of the bezel region of the interior mirror casing. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,671,996 and 5,820,245. It should be understood that one or more of these buttons or displays may be located elsewhere on the mirror assembly or separately in a module, for example of the type disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/244,726, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,613, and may comprise the touch-sensitive displays as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/192,721, filed Mar. 27, 2000. Note that button inputs can be provided along the lower bezel region of the interior mirror assembly such that, when actuated, a display appears within the mirror reflector region of the mirror reflective element. Preferably, the display appears local to the physical location of the particular button accessed by the driver or vehicle occupant (typically, immediately above it) so that the person accessing the mirror associates the appearance and information of the display called up by that individual button with the user's actuation of the button. Multiple actuations of that button can cause the display to scroll through various menu items/data displays, allowing the user to access a wide range of information. The button and associated circuitry can be adapted to recognize when a particular menu item is desired selected (such as holding down a particular input button for longer than a prescribed period, for example longer than about 1 second or longer than about 2 seconds or the like; if the button is held down for less than the prescribed period, the display scrolls to the next menu item). Preferably, whatever information is being displayed is displayed by a substantially reflecting and substantially transmitting reflective/transmissive reflector of the mirror reflective element such as the display on demand constructions disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,187. Also, these features can be provided for a non-mirror video display.
Optionally, one or more of the cameras of the vehicle may be equipped with infrared LED light emitting sources, such as are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/025,712, filed Feb. 18, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,953, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/244,726, filed Feb. 5, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,613, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/561,023, filed Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,308, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466,010, filed Dec. 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,975, in order to light up an area in or around the vehicle when it is dark. When an intrusion detector such as a motion detector (preferably a pyrodetector-based intrusion detection system such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/901,929, filed Jul. 29, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,625, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/516,831, filed Mar. 1, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,390,529, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/275,565, filed Mar. 24, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,131) is triggered by, for example, someone attempting to break into the vehicle or steal the vehicle, the vehicle-based security system triggers images captured by the vehicular camera(s) to be downloaded to the telemetry system which then forwards by wireless telecommunication (such as by radio frequency or by microwave transmission) the images (or a security alert signal derived from an in-vehicle image analysis of the captured images) to a security service, a mobile device in the possession of the driver of the vehicle when he/she is remote from the parked vehicle (such as a key-fob or a Palm Pilotâ¢ PDA), the cell phone of the vehicle owner, the home computer of the vehicle owner or the police or the like that is remote and distant from the vehicle where the security condition is being detected. Preferably, the in-vehicle camera-based security system silently and secretly records the events occurring in and/or around the vehicle while it is operating (such as when idling in traffic or moving on a highway or stopped at a traffic light) and provides a âblack boxâ recording of activities in the interior of the vehicle or exterior of the vehicle. For example, the security system may be used to record or document vehicle status including speed, brake activation, vehicle control status signals (for example, whether the turn signal has been actuated, vehicle traction, tire pressures, yaw and roll, geographic location, time and date) and other vehicle information as well as record visual images detected by the cameras. In an accident, such vehicle performance/function data in combination with a visual recording of the interior and/or exterior vehicular scene (and optionally, a microphone recording of sounds/voices interior and/or exterior to the vehicle) can help insurance and police investigators establish the causes and conditions of an accident. The camera-based vehicle performance/function recording system of the vehicle preferably records data onto a recording medium (such as onto electronic memory or onto digital recording tape) that is rugged and protected from the consequences of an accident so as to survive the impact forces, shocks, fires and other events possible in an automobile accident. Preferably, any electronic memory utilized is non-volatile memory that is non-erasing in the event of electrical power loss in the vehicle. For example, the camera-based in-vehicle security system may include an electronic memory recording medium and/or a video tape (preferably a digital) recording medium so that a pre-determined period of operation of the vehicle, such as up to the last about 1 minute of vehicle operation, more preferably up to the last about 5 minutes of vehicle operation, most preferably up to the last about 15 minutes of vehicle operation, or even greater, is continuously recorded (such as on a closed-loop tape or electronic recording that continually records the most recent events inside and/or outside the road transportation vehicle). The camera-based in-vehicle security system can maintain the stored images and/or vehicle data in the vehicle for downloading when desired such as after an accident. Alternately, the camera-based in-vehicle security system can transmit the images and/or vehicle data by wireless communication to a remote receiver such as a receiver distant and remote from the vehicle (such as at a security system or a telematic service such as ONSTARâ¢ or RESCUâ¢ or at the vehicle owners home or at a car rental center). This can occur continuously while the vehicle is being operated, so that in the event an accident occurs, retrieval and analysis of the recorded information is not impeded such as by damage or even loss of the vehicle in the accident. Also, the remote receiver of the information can alert authorities (such as a police, fire and/or ambulance service) of an accident immediately when such accident occurs (and thus potentially speed aid to any accident victims and/or dispatch the correct medical aid for the type of accident/injuries recorded by the camera(s)). The recorded information can include the gear in which the driver is operating the vehicle, the activation of the brakes, the speed at which the driver is traveling, the rate of acceleration/deceleration, the time, date and geographic location, the atmospheric conditions including lighting conditionsâbasically, the system can record what happened during a collision whereby the system provides an information recordation function. For example, when the system is used to record an accident when the vehicle is operating, the cameras may record scenes, vehicle instrument/function status, or the like which are kept on a tape or non-volatile electronic, solid-state memory, for example a continuous loop tape or electronic memory. Alternately, this information can be continuously transmitted or downloaded. For example, the information can be downloaded in response to a selected stimuli or trigger, such as when the brakes are activated, the air bag or bags are activated, when the horn is operated, or when the car de-accelerates, or the like. For example, the system may use accelerometers such as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/440,497, filed Nov. 15, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,411,204, and, furthermore, may be combined with the deceleration based anti-collision safety light control system described in the aforementioned application. This information recordation function can be used, as noted above, to record both interior activities and exterior activities and, therefore, can be used as noted above as a security system as well. When the system is used as a security system, the telemetry system may contact the security base who in turn can scroll through the camera images to determine whether the alarm is a true or false alarm. In this manner, various existing systems that are provided in the vehicle may be optionally used individually to provide one or more functions or collectively to provide even further or enhanced functions.
Examples of camera locations where vehicular cameras included in a vehicular camera-based accident recording system can be located include interior and exterior mirror assembly locations, roof areas such as a headliner or header console, front, side and rear exterior body areas such as front grilles, rear doors/trunk areas, side doors, side panels, door handles, CHMSL units, interior body pillars (such as an A-, B- or C-interior pillar) and seat backs, and such as are disclosed in U.S. provisional applications, Ser. No. 60/187,961, filed Mar. 9, 2000; Ser. No. 60/192,721, filed Mar. 27, 2000; and Ser. No. 60/186,520, filed Mar. 1, 2000; and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,897; 5,760,962; 5,959,367; 5,929,786; 5,949,331; 5,914,815; 5,786,772; 5,798,575 and 5,670,935; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/304,201, filed May 3, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,886; Ser. No. 09/375,315, filed Aug. 16, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,164; Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610; Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642; Ser. No. 09/372,915, filed Aug. 12, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,396,397; Ser. No. 09/304,201, filed May 3, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,409; and Ser. No. 09/313,139, filed May 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,447, which are all commonly assigned. For example, a camera, preferably a solid-state CMOS video camera, can be located within the interior cabin of the vehicle (and preferably located at, on or within the interior rearview mirror assembly or at or in an A-pillar), and adapted to capture a surveillance image of the front and rear occupants of the vehicle. In this regard, locating the interior cabin surveillance camera at, on or within the interior rearview mirror assembly is preferred as this location provides the camera with a good rearward field of view that captures an image of all front and rear seat occupants. Preferably, the vehicle is also equipped with the in-vehicle portion of a wireless communication telematic system such as an ONSTARâ¢ or RESCUâ¢ system, and the geographic location of the vehicle can also be established by a navigational system, such as an in-vehicle GPS system. Images of the interior vehicle cabin (including images of the various vehicle occupants) can be captured by the in-vehicle image capture device, preferably an interior mirror-mounted video camera, and this information, in conjunction with the geographic location of the vehicle provided by a position locator such as a GPS system, along with various vehicle information/function data such as the state of activation of any air bag in the vehicle, can be communicated by wireless telecommunication to an external service remote from the vehicle such as an ONSTARâ¢ or RESCUâ¢ service. Such communication can be periodic (such as when the ignition is first turned on during a particular trip, or initially when the ignition is first turned on and intermittently thereafter, such as every about 1 minute or so) or continuous during operation of the vehicle with its engine turned on. Should the receiver at the remote service be alerted that an accident has occurred (such as by receiving from the vehicle via wireless telematic communication an accident alert signal indicative that an air bag has activated), the remote receiver (which can be an ONSTARâ¢ operator or an automatic computer-based image analyzer or an emergency service such as a â911â service provider) can count, via the video imaged relayed from the vehicle, the number of occupants in the vehicle and can accordingly alert emergency services as to the location of the accident and the number of victims involved (thus ensuring that the appropriate number of, for example, ambulances are dispatched to deal with the actual number of potential victims in the vehicle at the time of the crash). Optionally, the owner/driver of the vehicle can register/notify the remote telematic service of any special medical needs, blood types and the likes of the likely driver(s) and/or likely occupants (such as family members) along with any next-of-kin information, insurance coverage and the like so that, in the event the like of an ONSTARâ¢ or RESCUâ¢ telematic service or telematically-linked â911â emergency response service determines an accident has occurred, medical and emergency relief specific to the likely/actual occupants of the vehicle can be dispatched. Likewise, should an in-vehicle fire be detected such as by visual determination via image analysis of video images telematically transmitted and/or by an in-vehicle temperature probe transmitting data telematically, then the fire brigade can be automatically sent to the crash site and/or an in-vehicle fire extinguisher can be activated to put out any fire (either by remote, wireless activation by the telematic service of the in-vehicle fire extinguisher or by automatic in-vehicle image analysis of the image recorded by an interior or exterior camera of the vehicle that, upon in-vehicle image analysis determining that a fire has occurred in the vehicle, causes a vehicular on-board fire extinguisher to actuate to put out the fire). Also, either remotely or via in-vehicle image analysis, the engine of the vehicle can be turned off after an accident has been detected via the vehicular camera system.
A variety of other electrical and electronic features can be incorporated into the assemblies, such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/433,467, filed Nov. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,613. For example, a microphone or a plurality of microphones may be incorporated, preferably to provide hands-free input to a wireless telecommunication system such as the ONSTARâ¢ system in use in General Motors vehicles. Most preferably, such microphones provide input to an audio system that transmits and communicates wirelessly with a remote transceiver, preferably in voice recognition mode. Such systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/382,720, filed Aug. 25, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,243,003.
In this regard it may be desirable to use audio processing techniques, such as digital sound processing, to ensure that vocal inputs to the vehicular audio system are clearly distinguished from cabin ambient noise such as from wind noise, HVAC, and the like. Digital sound processing techniques, as known in the acoustics arts and such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,865, entitled A METHOD FOR INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF SPEECH IN AN AUDIO SIGNAL, issued Sep. 25, 1990, to Stettiner et al., are particularly useful to enhance clarity of vocal signal detection when a single microphone is used, located in the interior mirror assembly such as in the mirror casing that houses the interior mirror reflective element, as part of a vehicular wireless communication system such as General Motors' ONSTARâ¢ system. Use of digital signal processing and a single mirror-mounted microphone (such as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/396,179, filed Sep. 14, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,278,377) is particularly advantageous for economical achievement of clear and error-free transmission from the vehicle, while operating along a highway, to a remote receiver, particularly in speech-recognition mode. Although advantageous with a single mirror-mounted microphone (or for a microphone mounted elsewhere in the vehicle cabin such as in the header region or in an accessory module assembly such as a windshield electronics module assembly), digital sound processing is also beneficial when multiple microphones are used, and preferably when at least two and more preferably at least four microphones are used.
As previously described, connection and communication between the video displays and/or the cameras and/or other electronic accessories can be by wired connection (including multi-element cables, wired multiplex links and fiber-optic cables) and/or by wireless connection/communication (such as by infrared communication and/or by radio frequency communication such as via BLUETOOTH, described below).
For example, the video displays may include a display of the speed limit applicable to the location where the vehicle is travelling. Conventionally, speed limits are posted as a fixed limit (for example, 45 MPH) that is read by the vehicle driver upon passing a sign. As an improvement to this, an information display (preferably an alphanumerical display and, more preferably, a reconfigurable display) can be provided within the vehicle cabin, and preferably displayed by a video display, and readable by the driver, that displays the speed limit at whatever location on the road/highway the vehicle actually is at any moment. For example, existing speed limit signs could be enhanced to include a transmitter that broadcasts a local speed limit signal, such signal being received by an in-vehicle receiver and displayed to the driver. The speed limit signal can be transmitted by a variety of wireless transmission methods, such as radio transmission, and such systems can benefit from wireless transmission protocols and standards, such as the BLUETOOTH low-cost, low-power radio based cable replacement or wireless link based on short-range radio-based technology. BLUETOOTH enables creation of a short-range (typically 30 feet or so although longer and shorter ranges are possible), wireless personal area network via small radio transmitters built into various devices. For example, transmission can be on a 2.45 gigahertz band, moving data at about 721 kilobits per second, or faster. BLUETOOTH, and similar systems, allow creation of an in-vehicle area network. Conventionally, features and accessories in the vehicle are wired together. Thus, for example, an interior electrochromic mirror and an exterior electrochromic mirror is connected by at least one wire in order to transmit control signal and the like. With BLUETOOTH and similar systems such as the IEEE 802.11a protocol which is a wireless local area network standard that preferably uses a 5 GigaHertz frequency band and with a data transfer rate of at least about 10 Mb/sec and more preferably at least about 30 Mb/sec, control commands can be broadcast between the interior mirror and the exterior mirror (and vice versa) or between a camera capturing an image in a horse box (or any other towed trailer) being towed by a vehicle and a video display located at the windshield or at the interior rearview mirror or at or adjacent to an A-pillar of that vehicle that is viewable by the vehicle driver without the need for physical wiring interconnecting the two. Likewise, for example, the two exterior mirror assemblies on the vehicle can exchange, transmit and/or receive control commands/signals (such as of memory position or the like such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,575) via an in-vehicle short-range radio local network such as BLUETOOTH. Similarly, tire pressure sensors in the wheels can transmit via BLUETOOTH to a receiver in the interior mirror assembly, and tire pressure status (such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/513,941, filed Feb. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,989) can be displayed, preferably at the interior rearview mirror. In the case of the dynamic speed limit system described above, preferably, the in-vehicle receiver is located at and/or the display of local speed limit is displayed at the interior mirror assembly (for example, a speed limit display can be located in a chin or eyebrow portion of the mirror case, such as in the mirror reflector itself, or such as in a pod attached to the interior mirror assembly), or can be displayed on any video display. More preferably, the actual speed of the vehicle can be displayed simultaneously with and beside the local speed limit in-vehicle display and/or the difference or excess thereto can be displayed. Optionally, the wireless-based speed limit transmission system can actually control the speed at which a subject vehicle travels in a certain location (such as by controlling an engine governor or the like) and thereby provide a vehicle speed control function. Thus, for example, a school zone speed limit can be enforced by transmission of a speed-limiting signal into the vehicle. Likewise, different classes of vehicles can be set for different speed limits for the same stretch of highway. The system may also require driver identification and then set individual speed limits for individual drivers reflecting their skill level, age, driving record and the like. Moreover, a global positioning system (GPS) can be used to locate a specific vehicle, calculate its velocity on the highway, verify what the allowed speed limit is at that specific moment on that specific stretch of highway, transmit that specific speed limit to the vehicle for display (preferably at the interior rearview mirror that the driver constantly looks at as part of the driving task) and optionally alert the driver or retard the driver's ability to exceed the speed limit as deemed appropriate. A short-range, local communication system such as envisaged in the BLUETOOTH protocol finds broad utility in vehicular applications, and particularly where information is to be displayed at the interior mirror assembly or on a video display, or where a microphone or user-interface (such as buttons to connect/interact with a remote wireless receiver) is to be located at the interior (or exterior) rearview mirror assembly. For example, a train approaching a railway crossing may transmit a wireless signal such as a radio signal (using the BLUETOOTH protocol or another protocol) and that signal may be received by and/or displayed at the interior rearview mirror assembly (or the exterior side view mirror assembly) or a video display. Also, the interior rearview mirror and/or the exterior side view mirrors and/or any video display can function as transceivers/display locations/interface locations for intelligent vehicle highway systems, using protocols such as the BLUETOOTH protocol. Protocols such as BLUETOOTH and the IEEE 802.11a wireless local area network standard that preferably uses a 5 GigaHertz frequency band and with a data transfer rate of at least about 10 Mb/sec and more preferably at least about 30 Mb/sec, as known in the telecommunications art, can facilitate voice/data, voice over data, digital and analog communication and vehicle/external wireless connectivity, preferably using the interior and/or exterior mirror assemblies as transceiver/display/user-interaction sites. Electronic accessories to achieve the above can be accommodated in any of the video displays/video mirrors/camera assemblies, and/or in the interior mirror assembly (such as in the housing disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/433,467, filed Nov. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,613).
Furthermore, information displays may be incorporated which provide information to the driver or occupants of the vehicle, such as warnings relating to the status of the passenger airbag or a train approaching warning. Such a train approaching warning system alerts the driver of the vehicle of the eminent arrival of a train at a railroad crossing. Such a warning system can activate audible and/or visual alarms in the vehicle if a train is approaching. Such train warning displays may override any existing displays so that the driver is fully alert to any potential hazard. One suitable train control system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/561,023, filed Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,308. Vehicle to road-side communication antennas can be attached to railroad signs, crossing barriers, and the like and can transmit to antennas mounted in the vehicle located such as within the interior rearview mirror of the vehicle or within an interior cabin trim item or side exterior rearview mirror assembly. One such track side communication system is available from Dynamic Vehicle Safety Systems of Amarillo, Tex., which detects signals from trains approaching a crossing and transmits these signals along the road to forewarn of a railroad crossing ahead.
In application Ser. No. 09/244,726, filed Feb. 5, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,613, information displays are provided which include information relating to vehicle or engine status, warning information, and the like such as information relating to oil pressure, fuel remaining, time, temperature, compass headings for vehicle direction, and the like. The passenger side air bag on/off signal may be derived from various types of seat occupancy detectors such as by video surveillance of the passenger seat as disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US94/01954, filed Feb. 25, 1994, published Sep. 1, 2004 as PCT Publication No. WO/1994/019212, or by ultrasonic or sonar detection, infrared sensing, pyrodetection, weight detection, or the like. Alternately, enablement/displayment of the passenger side air bag operation can be controlled manually such as through a user operated switch operated with the ignition key of the vehicle in which the assembly is mounted as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/799,734, filed Feb. 12, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,772.
In addition, the interior rearview mirror assembly may include a blind spot detection system, such as the type disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/799,734, filed Feb. 12, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,772, or rain sensor systems, for example rain sensor systems which include windshield contacting rain sensors, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,973,844 or non-windshield contacting rain sensors, such as described in PCT International Application PCT/US94/05093, published as WO 94/27262 on Nov. 24, 1994.
The interior rearview mirror assembly may also incorporate one or more user actuatable buttons or the like for activating the various accessories housed in the assembly, for example an ONSTAR system, HOMELINKÂ® system, a remote transaction system, or the like. For example, one or more user actuatable buttons may be mounted at the chin area or eyebrow area for actuating, for example a video screen, or for selecting or scrolling between displays or for activating, for example, a light, including a map light which may be incorporated into the mirror casing. Furthermore, a dimming switch may be incorporated into the casing to provide adjustment to the brightness of the video screen.
Also, a single high-intensity power LED may comprise a single LED light source in a compact package or as an individual chip or circuit element (and with a diagonal size less than about 14 mm diagonal cross-sectional dimension when viewed from the light emitting side; more preferably less than about 8 mm; and most preferably, less than about 5 mm) that illuminates to emit a light beam when (powered at about 25 degrees Celsius or thereabouts) at least about 100 milliamps passes (i.e., conducts) through the LED element (more preferably when at least about 225 milliamps passes through the LED element and most preferably when at least 300 milliamps passes through the LED element), and with a luminous efficiency of at least about 1 lumen/watt, more preferably at least about 3 lumens/watt, and most preferably at least about 7 lumens/watt. Such high-intensity power LEDs, when normally operating, emit a luminous flux of at least about 1 lumen, more preferably at least about 5 lumens and most preferably at least about 10 lumens. For certain applications such as ground illumination from lighted exterior mirror assemblies and interior mirror map lights, such high-intensity LEDs preferably conduct at least about 250 milliamps forward current when operated at a voltage in the about 2 volts to about 5 volts range, and emit a luminous flux of at least about 10 lumens, more preferably at least about 15 lumens, even more preferably at least about 20 lumens, and most preferably at least about 25 lumens, preferably emitting white light.
Single high-intensity power LEDs suitable to use include high-intensity, high-current capability light emitting diodes such as the high-flux LEDs available from LumiLeds Lighting, U.S., LLC of San Jose, Calif. under the Sun Power Series High-Flux LED tradename. Such high-intensity power LEDs comprise a power package allowing high-current operation of at least about 100 milliamps forward current, more preferably at least about 250 milliamps forward current, and most preferably at least about 350 milliamps forward current, through a single LED. Such high-current/high-intensity power LEDs (as high as 500 mA or more current possible, and especially with use of heat sinks) are capable of delivering a luminous efficiency of at least about 1 lumen per watt, more preferably at least about 3 lumens per watt, and most preferably at least about 5 lumens per watt. Such high-intensity LEDs are available in blue, green, blue-green, red, amber, yellow and white light emitting forms, as well as other colors. Such high-intensity LEDs can provide a wide-angle radiation pattern, such as an about 30 degree to an about 160 degree cone. Typically, such high-intensity LEDs are fabricated using Indium Gallium Nitride technology. To assist heat dissipation and maintain the LED junction below about 130Â° Celsius (and more preferably below about 100Â° Celsius and most preferably below about 70Â° Celsius), a heat sink can be used. Preferably, such a heat sink comprises a metal heat dissipater (such as an aluminum metal heat sink) with a surface area dissipating heat of at least about 1 square inch, more preferably of at least about 2.5 square inches, and most preferably of at least about 3.5 square inches. When used as, for example, a map light assembly mounted in an interior rearview mirror assembly (such as in the mirror housing or in a pod attaching to the mirror mount to the vehicle), a single high-intensity power LED (for example, a single white light emitting LED passing about 350 mA and emitting light, and preferably white light or any other color, with a luminous efficiency of at least about 3 lumens per watt, and with a light pattern of about 120Â° or so) can be combined with a reflector element and a lens to form a high-intensity power LED interior light module capable of directing an intense light beam of light from an interior mirror assembly mounted to a windshield or header region of the vehicle to the lap area of a driver or a front-seat passenger in order to allow a reading function such as a map reading function and/or to provide courtesy or theatre lighting within the vehicle cabin. Also, a single high-intensity power LED (for example, a single white light emitting LED or a red light emitting or any other colored light emitting diode passing about 350 mA and emitting light, preferably white light or any other color, with a luminous efficiency of at least about 3 lumens per watt, and with a light pattern of about 120Â° or so) can be combined with a reflector element and a lens to form a high-intensity LED security light module capable of directing an intense light beam of light (or any other color) from an exterior mirror assembly to illuminate the ground adjacent an entry door of the vehicle in order to provide a security lighting function. Also, a single high-intensity power LED (for example, a single white light emitting LED or a red light emitting or any other colored light emitting diode passing about 350 mA and emitting white light with a luminous efficiency of at least about 3 lumens per watt, and with a light pattern of about 120Â° or so) can be combined with a reflector element and a lens (and optionally with high-intensity and/or conventional near-IR light emitting diodes), and be used in conjunction with a reversing or forward parking camera mounted on the exterior of a vehicle (such as at a license plate holder) in order to provide illumination for the, for example, reverse-aid camera when reversing at night.
For applications such as ground illumination from exterior mirror assemblies and map/reading lighting from interior mirror assemblies or from windshield-mounted accessory modules such as windshield electronic modules or for ground illumination/camera-field-of-view illumination in association with video-based reverse-aids systems or park-aid systems or tow hitch-aid systems, it is preferable to use a single high-intensity power LED source having a luminous efficiency of at least about 7 lumens/watt; more preferably at least about 15 lumens/watt; and most preferably at least about 20 lumens/watt, with such single high efficiency power LED light source preferably being provided in a module that includes a heat sink/heat dissipater and most preferably, that further includes a power regulator such as a series power resistor and most preferably, a DC to DC voltage converter. Such high efficiency power LEDs are available from LumiLeds Lighting, U.S., LLC of San Jose, Calif. under the Sun Power Series High-Flux LED tradename, for example.
Also, a video display element or screen can be used (such as an LCD display or an emitting display element such as a multi-pixel electroluminescent display or field emission display or light emitting diode display (organic or inorganic)) disposed within the mirror housing of the interior mirror assembly of the vehicle, and located behind the mirror reflective element in the mirror housing, and configured so that the image displayed by the video display element is visible to the driver by viewing through the mirror reflective element. Preferably, and such as is disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, the mirror reflective element (behind which the video display screen is disposed so that the image displayed is visible by viewing through the mirror reflective element) of the interior mirror assembly preferably comprises a transflective mirror reflector such that the mirror reflective element is significantly transmitting to visible light incident from its rear (i.e. the portion furthest from the driver in the vehicle), with at least about 15% transmission preferred, at least about 20% transmission more preferred and at least about 25% transmission most preferred, while simultaneously, the mirror reflective element is substantially reflective to visible light incident from its front (i.e. the position closest to the driver when the interior mirror assembly is mounted in the vehicle), with at least about 60% reflectance preferred, at least about 70% reflectance more preferred and at least about 75% reflectance most preferred. Preferably a transflective electrochromic reflective mirror element is used (such as is disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,663; 5,724,187) that comprises an electrochromic medium sandwiched between two substrates. The front (i.e. closest to the driver when the interior mirror assembly is mounted in the vehicle) substrate preferably comprises a glass substrate having a transparent electronic conductive coating (such as indium tin oxide or doped tin oxide) on its inner surface (and contacting the electrochromic medium). More preferably, the front substrate of the twin-substrate electrochromic cell that sandwiches the electrochromic medium comprises a glass substrate having a thickness of about 1.6 millimeters or less; most preferably, about 1.1 millimeters or less. The rear (i.e. furthest from the driver when the interior mirror assembly is mounted in the vehicle) substrate preferably comprises a glass substrate having a transflective mirror reflector on the surface thereof that the electrochromic medium contacts (such a configuration being referred to as a âthird-surfaceâ reflector in the electrochromic mirror art). For example, the mirror reflector can comprise a transparent semiconductor/metal conductor/transparent semiconductor multilayer stack such an indium tin oxide/silver/indium tin oxide stack (for example, a third-surface electrochromic mirror reflective element can be used comprising a front substrate comprising an about 1.1 mm thick glass substrate having a half-wave ITO coating of about 12 ohms/square sheet resistance on its inner surface; a rear substrate comprising an about 1.6 mm thick glass substrate having a transflective mirror reflector thereon comprising an about 350 angstrom thick silver metal layer sandwiched between an about 800 angstrom thick indium thin oxide transparent semiconductor layer and another about 800 angstrom thick indium thin oxide transparent semiconductor layer; and with an electrochromic solid polymer matrix medium such as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,245,262 disposed between the transflective mirror reflector of the rear substrate and the half-wave indium tin oxide layer of the front substrate. Visible light reflectivity of the transflective electrochromic mirror element is about 60-65%; transmission is about 20-25%. With a TFT LCD video display disposed behind the rear substrate of such a third-surface transflective electrochromic mirror reflective element in a âdisplay-on-demandâ configuration, the presence of (and image displayed by) the video display screen is only principally visible to the driver (who views through the transflective mirror reflective element) when the video display element is powered so as to project light from the rear of the mirror reflective element).
Also, and as disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, incorporated above, an image on the screen includes a video view rearward of the vehicle, and also preferably includes electronically generated indicia overlaying the video image on the video screen and indicating the distance of detected objects (such as via a graphic display or via an alphanumeric display in feet/inches) and/or highlighting of obstacles/objects that a reversing vehicle is in jeopardy of colliding with (such as a child or a barrier). For example, red highlighting can be used, or a screen portion can strobe/flash to draw the driver's attention to an object in the screen. Also, the control can provide an audible output signal to a speaker that audibly alerts the driver that the vehicle is reversing closer and closer to a rear-situated object. The combination of a video reverse-aid system with an audible reverse-aid system based off an object detection system such as an ultrasonic obstacle detection system is a significant advance over reversing systems known to date, and particularly with distance or similar graphics overlaying the video image of the rearward scene.
Also, any of the video screens of the above embodiments, and such as disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268, can display the image output by a forward facing image capture device (preferably positioned to capture a video image of the ground surface/objects/persons immediately in front of the vehicle, most preferably encompassing an area that encompasses substantially the entire front fender width of the vehicle) and/or can display the image output by a rearward facing image capture device positioned to capture a video image of the ground surface/objects/persons immediately to the rear of the vehicle, most preferably encompassing an area that encompasses substantially the entire rear fender width of the vehicle. Preferably, a graphic overlay with indicia of forward or backup travel, such as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/313,139 filed May 19, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,447, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/776,625, filed Feb. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,611,202, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,331. For example, the intended path of travel and/or a distance grid can be electronically superimposed upon the video image from a reverse-aid camera as displayed on any screen of the above video mirrors, video display assemblies and accessory modules.
As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268 (incorporated by reference above), a towing vehicle is equipped with a reversing-aid camera (that is mounted, for example, at the rear license plate region of vehicle). The reversing-aid camera has its field of view directed to include the tow bar/hitch connection, as well as the leading portion of the towed container. The driver is provided with a control that allows him/her toggle between the reversing-aid camera and a tow container reverse-aid camera. When the driver selects the reversing-aid camera, a view of the tow-bar/tow container (that may be a boat or a U-Haul trailer or an animal container or a trailer tent or any other trailer type) is displayed on a video display screen (that can be any of the video display screens of the present invention). When the driver selects the tow container reverse-aid camera, a view to the rear of the tow container (that may be a boat or a U-Haul trailer or an animal container or a trailer tent or any other trailer type) is displayed on the video display screen (that can be any of the video display screens of the present invention).
Also, a variety of lenses (both refractive and diffractive) can be used to define the field of view of the cameras of the present invention. For reverse-aid type cameras, a wide angle lens is useful so that a view of the entire road immediately to the rear of the vehicle, and of width of the vehicle, is captured. To reduce any image distortion, optical image distortion reduction means and/or software-based image distortion reducing means, as known in the art, can be used. Optionally, two cameras can be used to assist reversing; one equipped with a wide-angle lens and mounted such as at the rear license plate of the vehicle in order to view a near field of zero to 5 feet or so immediately exteriorly, and a second camera, aimed more far field to capture an image of traffic and obstacles further down the path the vehicle is reversing in, can be used. Selection of one or the other of the first and second camera can be at the driver's discretion, or alternately, engagement of the reverse gear handle by the driver initially selects the first, near-field view so that the driver can check it is safe to initiate a reverse move, and then once the reverse gear is fully engaged and the vehicle is actually moving in reverse, the second, far-field view is selected.
The video screen can be used with at least one of a rear back-up camera, a baby-minder camera, and a sidelane-viewing camera. An image capturing device is in communication with the video screen, which displays images captured by the image capturing device and, further, displays indicia overlaying the video image. For example, the indicia may comprise a graphic display or an alphanumeric display.
The video screen may display an information display selected from the group consisting of a rain sensor operation display, a telephone information display, a highway status information display, a blind spot indicator display, a hazard warning display, a vehicle status display, a page message display, a speedometer display, a tachometer display, an audio system display, a fuel gage display, a heater control display, an air conditioning system display, a status of inflation of tires display, an email message display, a compass display, an engine coolant temperature display, an oil pressure display, a cellular phone operation display, a global positioning display, a weather information display, a temperature display, a traffic information display, a telephone number display, a fuel status display, a battery condition display, a time display, a train approach warning display, and a toll booth transaction display.
The video screen may comprise one of a vacuum fluorescent display element, a light emitting diode display, an electroluminescent display element, a multi-pixel display element, a reconfigurable display element, and a scrolling display element.
In another aspect, a video mirror system includes a variable intensity control which is in communication with the video screen, which varies the display intensity of the video screen, for example, in response to ambient lighting conditions.
Note that since a rear-facing camera will have a portion exposed to the outdoor elements such as rain, ice, snow, road splash, dirt etc., it is desirable that a cleaning means be included to maintain any lens/lens cover clean/contaminant-free. For example, use of vectored airflow can be used to blow away any accumulated rain drops etc. on the lens/lens cover. Thus, the camera assembly, and its installation into the rear of the vehicle, can be constructed so as to include air channeling elements such as baffles to channel airflow over the rear-facing lens portion, and so remove water drops therefrom. A lens heater (such as a glass plate coated with a transparent resistive coating such as indium tin oxide or doped tin oxide) can be included to defog/de-ice the camera lens. Alternately, or in addition, a mechanical wiper can be provided. Also, a lens cover can be provided that mechanically removes only when the rear-facing camera is accessed to view rearward, so as to minimize the time that the lens is exposed to the outdoor elements. Thus, for example, a metal or plastic shield or shutter can be disposed over the camera lens when the camera is not in use (such as when the vehicle is parked or when the vehicle is driving forward). However, when the engine is operating, and reverse gear of the vehicle transmission system is engaged by the driver, the cover over (and protecting) the camera lens is mechanically opened/removed (such as by rotating out of the way) to expose the lens of the camera and to allow the camera view rearwardly. Once reverse gear is disengaged, the mechanical shutter closes over the camera lens, protecting it once again from the outdoor elements. An output of the camera is provided as an input to a control. The system also includes an object-monitoring sensor (preferably, an ultrasonic sensor such as is known in the art, or a radar sensor or an infrared sensor, or the like, such as is known in the art). The object monitoring sensor generates an output indicative of detection of an object rearward of the vehicle, and preferably includes a measure of the distance of that detected object from the rear of the vehicle. The output is also provided to the control. The control generates a video output signal which is provided as an input to the video screen, which preferably is mounted at, on, or within the interior rearview mirror assembly in the vehicle. The image on the screen generated thereby includes a video view rearward of the vehicle, and also preferably includes electronically generated indicia overlaying the video image on the video screen and indicating the distance of detected objects (such as via a graphic display or via an alphanumeric display in feet/inches) and/or highlighting of obstacles/objects that a reversing vehicle is in jeopardy of colliding with (such as a child or a barrier). For example, red highlighting can be used, or a screen portion can strobe/flash to draw the driver's attention to an object in the screen. Also, the control can provide an audible output signal to a speaker that audibly alerts the driver that the vehicle is reversing closer and closer to a rear-situated object. The combination of a video reverse-aid system with an audible reverse-aid system based off an object detection system such as an ultrasonic obstacle detection system is a significant advance over reversing systems known to date, and particularly with distance or similar graphics overlaying the video image of the rearward scene.
Preferably, the video screens used in this present invention are pixelated liquid crystal displays, or most preferably, are pixelated emitting displays such as field emission displays or plasma displays or electroluminescent displays such as organic electroluminescent displays. Alternately, a cathode ray tube video screen can be used. Also note, as described above, the display on the video screen can be a reconfigurable display capable of displaying a plurality of vehicle functions. Also, the field of view of any camera inside or outside the vehicle can be fixed, or it can be variable such as by manipulating a joystick or the like. For example, a manual control to move the field of view of the camera and/or its focus and/or its zoom can be included in the joystick or similar controls conventionally provided to adjust outside sideview mirror reflectors.
Also, dynamic color selection can be used in operating the video display. Also, optionally, a Kopin display, as known in the art, can be used. Optionally, the electronics to generate an image can be located at, on or in the interior mirror assembly, and an image can be projected from the interior mirror assembly toward the vehicle windshield for viewing by the driver of the vehicle by looking at or through the vehicle windshield.
Note that communication between any camera and the display screen can be by wire (such as a direct wire connection or via an optical fiber link) or via a bus system (such as a CAN or LIN system, as known in the arts) or wirelessly such as by IR or RF communication (such as using a local area RF broadcast network such as the BLUETOOTH protocol from Motorola).
Also, to minimize cost in the system, the video screen can connect to a control that provides a direct row/column drive to the pixelated array of the video screen; and with the control itself receiving a direct row/column feed from the pixelated array of the camera (such as a CMOS camera) used to capture the image desired displayed on the video screen. Row and column drivers for the video screen can be included in the video screen package itself, such as via flexible circuitry attached to the back of the video screen element (typically a glass element) itself.
Also, because ambient light washout can be a problem for a mirror-mounted video display (or any other video display of the present invention), a contrast enhancement filter can be disposed over the video screen (or incorporated into its construction) to increase the contrast ratio between the video image and ambient light. Optionally, anti-reflective coatings/films/layers can be used to reduce surface reflections off the video screen. Suitable anti-reflective coatings/films/layers are known in the art and can include diffuser surface layers and interference layers. Optionally, an electrically variable contrast enhancement filter can be used overlying the video screen, such as an electro-optic (preferably electrochromic) contrast enhancement filter.
Also, optionally, a video screen displaying an image of the rearward scene of the vehicle, and preferably displaying a panoramic image such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,670,935 and 5,550,677 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/199,907, filed Nov. 25, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,610, and Ser. No. 09/361,814, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,642, can be used instead of a conventional mirror reflector.
Also, and especially for video mirror assemblies where the video screen is incorporated as part of an interior electro-optic (such as electrochromic) mirror assembly, a common circuit board and/or common electronic components and sub-circuitry can be utilized to control the electro-optic activity of the reflective element and to control the image displayed by the video screen, thus achieving economy of design and function and for operating other electrical or electronic functions supported in the interior rearview assembly. For example, a circuit board of the interior mirror assembly may support, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs) for illuminating indicia on display elements provided on a chin or eyebrow portion of the bezel region of the interior mirror casing. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,671,996 and 5,820,245. It should be understood that one or more of these buttons or displays may be located elsewhere on the mirror assembly or separately in a module, for example of the type disclosed in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/244,726, entitled âREARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY INCORPORATING VEHICLE INFORMATION DISPLAYâ, filed by DeLine et al., and may comprise the touch-sensitive displays as disclosed in U.S. provisional application entitled âINTERACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REARVIEW SYSTEMâ, Ser. No. 60/192,721, filed Mar. 27, 2000.
Also, the video display in any of the video mirror applications of the present invention can function as the display screen for a portable computer device, a portable cellular phone, and/or a portable personal digital assistant device (PDA) such as a Palm Pilotâ¢ or other personal digital assistant. When serving as the display screen of a PDA, the PDA/in-vehicle display screen can optionally operate in combination with a cellular phone or as a stand-alone device. Also, any of the video screens of the present invention can serve multiple purposes such as a video screen for an on-board vehicular camera and/or as the video monitor screen for a portable computing/PDA/cellular phone/telecommunication device. The video display system of the present invention can itself function as an in-vehicle PDA and/or cellular phone, in addition to other functions as described above. Portable devices such as PDAs, cellular phones, and palm/notebook/laptop portable computers can connect to/communicate with the video mirror systems of the present invention by direct wired connection/docking or by wireless communication such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/561,023, filed Apr. 28, 2000, entitled âVEHICLE-BASED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH SMART MAP FILTERING, PORTABLE UNIT HOME-BASE REGISTRATION AND MULTIPLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM PREFERENTIAL USEâ, to Uhlmann et al.; U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/131,593, filed Apr. 29, 1999, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/199,676, filed Apr. 21, 2000. Preferably, the video mirror systems of the present invention are equipped with a mobile device communication port (such as an IrDA-port) that transmits/receives data via wireless infrared communication. For example, any of the video display housings and/or any of the video attachment members/mounts and/or any of the interior mirror assemblies can be equipped with a mobile device communication port (such as an IrDA-port) that transmits/receives data via wireless infrared communication. Also, any of the video display assemblies, including any of the video screens or video display housings can be adapted to receive data input by touch such as by a human finger or a stylus such as via a touch screen, and such as is disclosed in U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/192,721, filed Mar. 27, 2000, entitled âINTERACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REARVISION SYSTEMâ, to Lynam et al.
As disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268), incorporated above, a forward facing camera can be mounted such as at the front grille or front fender/bumper or front bonnet/hood area of the vehicle, and with its field of view directed to capture an image of the road surface immediately in front of the vehicle. With such as forward parking-aid camera device (that can utilize wide-angle optics and other techniques as previously described and referenced with regards to reverse back-up aid cameras), the driver of a vehicle, such as a large SUV such as the MY2000 Ford Excursion vehicle from Ford Motor Company, can see how close the front fender/bumper is from another vehicle or a barrier or the like when the driver is parking the vehicle. Optionally, a driver actuatable switch can be provided to allow the driver select display of the view from the forward-facing park-aid camera device. Alternately, and preferably, the image from the forward-facing park-aid camera device is displayed on the in-vehicle video screen (such as any of the screens disclosed herein) whenever the vehicle is moving in a forward direction at a velocity less than a predetermined slow velocity (for example, when moving forward at less than about 7 miles/hour or less than about 5 miles per hour or less than about 3 miles per hour), such slow forward speed of travel being potentially indicative of a parking event occurring. Optionally, the forward facing park-aid view can be displayed whenever the vehicle is stationary with its engine operating as a safety measure to prevent inadvertent collision with obstacles or persons upon moving forward.
As disclosed in U.S. utility patent application Ser. No. 09/793,002, filed Feb. 26, 2001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,268) incorporated above, interconnection to and communication with the components of the video mirror systems of the present invention can be via a variety of means and protocols including J2284, J1850, UART, optical fiber, hard wired, wireless RF, wireless IR and wireless microwave. Also, the image displayed on the display screen can adapt/change depending on the driving task condition. For example, if reverse gear is selected, and as previously described, the display can automatically change to display the image immediately behind the vehicle. If this is the current view at the time the reverse gear is initially engaged, no change is necessary. Also, reverse gear selection can turn on any additional illumination sources (IR, visible etc.). For vehicle equipped with blind spot cameras as well as a reversing camera, a split screen display can be used to show the area immediately behind the vehicle and to the vehicle sides. When reverse gear is disengaged, the additional illumination can automatically turn off, and the video screen can revert to its pre-reversing display image. When reversing, additional warning inputs can be displayed or audibly communicated to the driver such as a warning of objects detected, peripheral motion, the direction in which an object detected lies, and the distance to an object (determined by radar, ultrasonic, infrared, and/or vision analysis). Such objects/data detected can be displayed as icons and/or an alphanumerical display on a video image of the rearward scene and/or on a graphic representation of the rearward view.
As disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 5,670,935, incorporated above, a rearview vision system for a vehicle includes at least one image capture device directed rearwardly with respect to the direction of travel of the vehicle. A display system displays an image synthesized from output of the image captive device. The display system is preferably contiguous with the forward field of view of the vehicle driver at a focal length that is forward of the vehicle passenger compartment. A plurality of image capture devices may be provided and the display system displays a unitary image synthesized from outputs of the image captive devices which approximates a rearward-facing view from a single location, such as forward of the vehicle.
For enhancing the interpretation of visual information in the rearview vision system by presenting information in a manner which does not require significant concentration of the driver or present distractions to the drive, the rearview vision system has at least two image capture devices positioned on the vehicle and directed rearwardly with respect to the direction of travel of the vehicle. A display is provided for images captured by the image capture devices. The display combines the captured images into an image that would be achieved by a single rearward-looking camera having a view unobstructed by the vehicle. In order to obtain all of the necessary information of activity, not only behind but also alongside of the vehicle, the virtual camera should be positioned forward of the driver. The image synthesized from the multiple image capture devices may have a dead space which corresponds with the area occupied by the vehicle. This dead space is useable by the driver's sense of perspective in judging the location of vehicles behind and alongside of the equipped vehicle.
Techniques are provided for synthesizing images captured by individual, spatially separated, image capture devices into such ideal image, displayed on the display device. This may be accomplished by providing at least three image capture devices. At least two of the image capture devices are side image capture devices mounted on opposite sides of the vehicle. At least one of the image capture devices is a center image capture device mounted laterally between the side image capture devices. A display system displays an image synthesized from outputs of the image capture devices. The displayed image includes an image portion from each of the image capture devices.
Preferably, perspective lines are included at lateral edges of the dead space which are aligned with the direction of travel of the vehicle and, therefore, appear in parallel with lane markings. This provides visual clues to the driver's sense of perspective in order to assist in judging distances of objects around the vehicle.
Image enhancement means are provided for enhancing the displayed image. Such means may be in the form of graphic overlays superimposed on the displayed image. Such graphic overlap may include indicia of the anticipated path of travel of the vehicle which is useful in assisting the driver in guiding the vehicle in reverse directions. Such graphic overlay may include a distance grid indicating distances behind the vehicle of objects juxtaposed with the grid.
The vehicle, which may be an automobile, a light truck, a sport utility vehicle, a van, a bus, a large truck, or the like, includes a rearview vision system for providing a driver of the vehicle with a view rearwardly of the vehicle with respect to the direction of travel of the vehicle. The vision system includes at least two side image capture devices positioned, respectively, on opposite sides of vehicle and a center image capture device positioned on the lateral centerline of the vehicle. All of the image capture devices are directed generally rearwardly of the vehicle. The rearview vision system additionally includes an image processor for receiving data signals from image capture devices and synthesizing, from the data signals, a composite image which is displayed on a display.
Images captured by image capture devices are juxtaposed on the display by the image processor in a manner which approximates the view from a single virtual image capture device positioned forwardly of the vehicle at a location and facing rearwardly of the vehicle, with the vehicle being transparent to the view of the virtual image capture device. The vision system provides a substantially seamless panoramic view rearwardly of the vehicle without duplicate or redundant images of objects. Furthermore, elongated, laterally-extending, objects, such as the earth's horizon, appear uniform and straight across the entire displayed image. The displayed image provides a sense of perspective, which enhances the ability of the driver to judge location and speed of adjacent trailing vehicles.
Each of the side image capture devices has a field of view and is aimed rearwardly with respect to the vehicle about an axis which is at an angle, with respect to the vehicle, that is half of the horizontal field of view of the image capture device. In this manner, each of the image capture devices covers an area bounded by the side of the vehicle and extending outwardly at an angle defined by the horizontal field of view of the respective side image capture device. The center image capture device has a horizontal field of view, which is symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The field of view of each side image capture device intersect the field of view of the center image capture device at a point which is located a distance behind the vehicle.
Rear blind zones are located symmetrically behind the vehicle extending from the rear of the vehicle to a point. Side blind zones located laterally on respective sides of the vehicle extend rearwardly of the forward field of view of the driver to the field of view of the respective side image capture device.
A left overlap zone and a right overlap zone extend rearward from respective points where the horizontal fields of view of the side image capture devices intersect the field of view of the center image capture device. Overlap zones define areas within which an object will be captured both by the center image capture device and one of the side image capture devices. An object in an overlap zone will appear on the display in multiple image portions in a redundant or duplicative fashion. In order to avoid the presentation of redundant information to the driver, and thereby avoid confusion and simplify the task of extracting information from the multiple images or combined images on the display, the object should avoid overlapping zones.
When operating the vehicle in the reverse direction, it may be desirable to provide additional data concerning the area surrounding the immediate rear of the vehicle. This may be accomplished by utilizing non-symmetrical optics for the center image capture device in order to provide a wide angle view at a lower portion of the field of view. Alternatively, a wide angle optical system could be utilized with the electronic system selectively correcting distortion of the captured image. Such a system would provide a distortion-free image while obtaining more data, particularly in the area surrounding the back of the vehicle.
Use of more than three image capture devices is comprehended. In addition to side image capture devices positioned at the front sides of the vehicle and a center image capture device positioned at the center rear of the vehicle, additional image capture devices may be useful at the rear corners of the vehicle in order to further eliminate blind spots. It may additionally be desirable to provide an additional center image capture device at a higher elevation in order to obtain data immediately behind the vehicle and thereby fill in the road surface detail immediately behind the vehicle. Such additional detail is particularly useful when operating the vehicle in the reverse direction. Of course, each of the image capture devices could be a combination of two or more image capture devices.
An image display device displays a composite image made up of a left image portion, a right image portion, and a center image portion. The display may additionally include indicia such as the readout of a compass, vehicle speed, turn signals, and the like as well as other graphical or video displays, such as a navigation display, a map display, and a forward-facing vision system. In this manner, the rearview vision system may be a compass vision system or an information vision system.
The display is of a size to be as natural as possible to the driver. This is a function of the size of the display and the distance between the display and the driver and is preferably positioned within the driver's physiological field of view without obstructing the view through the windshield. It is known that the driver's field of view, with the head and eyes fixed forward, extends further in a downward direction than in an upward direction. The display could be located above the vertical view through the windshield wherein the display may be observed at the upward portion of the driver's field of view. However, the position for the display is preferred wherein the display is within the lower portion of the driver's field of view.
The display is a flat panel display, such as a back-lit liquid crystal display, a plasma display, a field emission display, or a cathode ray tube. However, the synthesized image could be displayed using other display techniques such as to provide a projected or virtual image. One such virtual display is a heads-up display. The display may be mounted/attached to the dashboard, facia or header, or to the windshield at a position conventionally occupied by an interior rearview mirror.
Although various camera devices may be utilized for image capture devices, an electro-optic, pixelated imaging array, located in the focal plane of an optical system, is preferred. Such imaging array allows the number of pixels to be selected to meet the requirements of rearview vision system. A commercially available display may be used, however, by leaving a horizontal band of the display for displaying alpha-numeric data, such as portions of an instrument cluster, compass display, or the like.
The image capture devices are CMOS imaging arrays of the type manufactured by VLSI Vision Ltd. of Edinburgh, Scotland, which are described in more detail U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/023,918 filed Feb. 26, 1993, by Kenneth Schofield and Mark Larson for an AUTOMATIC REARVIEW MIRROR SYSTEM USING A PHOTOSENSOR ARRAY, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,550,677. However, other pixelated focal plane image-array devices, which are sensitive to visible or invisible electromagnetic radiation, could be used. The devices could be sensitive to either color or monochromatic visible radiation or near or far infrared radiation of the type used in night-vision systems. Each image capture device could be a combination of different types of devices, such as one sensitive to visible radiation combined with one sensitive to infrared radiation. Examples of other devices known in the art include charge couple devices and the like.
The relationship is enhanced between the driver's primary view and the image presented on the rearview vision system. This is accomplished in a manner which provides ease of interpretation while avoiding confusion so that the driver does not have to concentrate or look closely at the image. In this manner, information presented on the display is naturally assimilated. This is accomplished while reducing blind spots so that other vehicles or objects of interest to the driver will likely be displayed to the driver. Additionally, the use of perspective allows distances to be more accurately determined.
It is further envisioned that the control may provide a warning or alert to the driver of the vehicle when the actual geographic position of the vehicle (as provided by the global positioning system of the vehicle) is not where it should be based on the instructions received from the remote service center. For example, the control may instruct the driver to turn around or otherwise get back onto the given route, or the control may instruct the driver to contact the service center to obtain updated directions based on the new position of the vehicle. This may be done if, for example, the geographic position of the vehicle is outside of a predetermined or threshold range or distance of the next location or waypoint, or if the geographic position of the vehicle is past the location or waypoint. Optionally, the control may provide audible chirps or other audible signal or the like delivered by a speaker to alert the driver when approaching a turn or to indicate to the driver that the driver has missed a turn.
The control may also be operable to continuously monitor the actual geographic position of the vehicle and compare to the locations or waypoints associated with the instructions even after the vehicle has strayed from the given route. As discussed above, the control may provide instructions to turn around to get back on the given route. However, if the vehicle continues along a different path (such as in situations where the driver gets lost and attempts to find a way back to the given route, or where the driver may take an alternate route, such as an alternate route known to the driver or a detour or the like), but eventually arrives at one of the geographic locations or waypoints associated with the downloaded instructions, the control may be operable to recognize that the vehicle is back on the given route and resume communicating/displaying the appropriate instructions to the driver to direct the driver to the targeted destination.
During operation, as the driver is driving the vehicle, the driver may access or contact a service center via the telematics system 18 of the vehicle, such as ONSTARÂ®, TELEAIDâ¢, RESCUÂ® or the like, depending on the type of vehicle, and request driving directions to a particular desired destination or targeted location. The operator or service center may provide the directions to the desired destination from the known position of the vehicle (which may be provided by the driver to the service center or may be known by the service center in response to the global positioning system of the vehicle). Preferably, the service center communicates the directions and downloads the directions to a storage location or control of the vehicle. The directions or instructions are electronically or digitally or otherwise coded or tagged or otherwise associated with or linked to a particular geographic location or waypoint either by the remote service center or by the control. The control is then operable to provide the directions in sections or parts or steps, with each separate, particular step or instruction being provided to the driver in response to the current geographic position of the vehicle (based on a signal from the global positioning system of the vehicle) generally corresponding to a particular geographic location or waypoint associated with the particular step or instruction. For example, a step may be provided in response to the vehicle completing a previous step of the directions, and/or may be provided in response to the vehicle approaching (such as the vehicle being within a threshold distance of) the street, intersection, location or the like at which the next step or turn is to be performed, without affecting the scope of the present invention.
Therefore, the present invention provides a navigation system which is operable to provide step-by-step instructions to a targeted destination to a driver of a vehicle while the driver is driving the vehicle toward the targeted destination. The instructions are downloaded from a remote database at a remote service center or the like via a telematics system or wireless communication system of the vehicle. The instructions may then be provided to the driver only as needed by the driver, since they are coded or associated with or linked to particular geographic locations or waypoints, thereby simplifying the instructions so that the driver will be able to understand each step and execute the step accordingly. The instructions may be downloaded to a storage or memory location or system of the vehicle during a brief communication or connection with the remote service center, so that the driver does not have to remain connected with the remote service center or repeatedly contact the service center to receive updated instructions as the driver drives the vehicle toward the targeted destination. The downloaded instructions are only the local instructions and thus do not require an excessive amount of time to download nor do they require an excessive amount of storage space or memory on the control. Thus, the remote service center, operator, computerized system or the like maintains the detailed maps and directories, and feeds back or downloads wirelessly to the vehicle the local information or map for communication or display to the driver of the vehicle for directional guidance information.
Optionally, the telematics system or communication link or other system may be operable to download data, such as via ONSTARÂ® or other communication system, or via a global positioning system or the like, to the vehicle or to a control or system or accessory of the vehicle. The data may be used to adjust an accessory or system of the vehicle or to set the accessory or system of the vehicle to a desired or appropriate setting in response to the data and/or in response to other vehicle or driver characteristics or status.
For example, data pertaining to the location of the vehicle, the time of day, the date, weather conditions and/or driving conditions may be provided to the vehicle for use in adjustment of an accessory or system of the vehicle. For example, such data may be used by a seat adjustment system, such that adjustment of the driver or passenger seat of the vehicle may be made in response to changes in such data. This may be beneficial because, for example, during long journeys, the seat adjustment or position at the start of the journey may not be comfortable or appropriate later on in the long journey. The seat adjustment system of the present invention thus may be operable to adjust the seat position or lumbar support or the like (and the mirror position or positions may also be adjusted accordingly) in response to various conditions, such as the length of the journey, altitude of the vehicle, driving conditions and/or the like. The seat adjustment system thus may make dynamic adjustments of the seat or seats to keep the driver or occupants of the vehicle comfortable or alert.
Optionally, it is envisioned that the seats of the vehicle may have a massage capability. In such applications, the seat adjustment system or seat control system may detect that the vehicle is on a long journey, and may activate the massage function to enhance the comfort to the driver of the vehicle. Such an adjustment or control may also be enabled if rural highway conditions are detected or other driving conditions where such a feature may be desired. It is further envisioned that the seat adjustment or control system may be programmable, such that a particular driver or occupant may indicate what changes he or she may desire in certain conditions. The seat adjustment system may then automatically activate such features or changes when the specified conditions are detected.
Optionally, the adjustment may also or otherwise be made in response to biometric data about the driver or occupant that is presently occupying the seat. It is known to use body measurements to order clothing tailored to the body measurements. Many catalogue clothing companies are now taking body scan measurements to order clothing on line. These measurements ensure a substantially perfect fit of the ordered clothing. Such body scan measurements or data or other such biometric data may be entered into the vehicle seat adjustment system, or may be communicated to the vehicle seat adjustment system, such as via the telematics system or other communication system or data system or the like. The seat adjustment system may then adjust the seat (and the mirrors may be adjusted as well) in response to detection of a particular person and/or their biometric characteristics or data.
Referring now FIGS. 3 and 4, a biometric seat adjustment system 110 is operable to adjust the seats 112 of a vehicle 114. The biometric seat adjustment system 110 may adjust a driver seat 112 a, a front passenger seat 112 b, and/or one or more rear passenger seats 112 c via a powered seat adjustment mechanism 116 (FIG. 4) at the respective seats in response to biometric data or information pertaining to a person that may be sitting in or may be about to sit in one of the vehicle seats. As shown in FIG. 4, biometric seat adjustment system 110 includes a control 118, which may store biometric data 120 in a memory and/or may receive biometric data 120 from a remote source or an input device or communication (not shown). Control 118 is operable to control or adjust the seat adjustment mechanism 116 to adjust the seats 112 of the vehicle (such as lumbar support, seat travel, seat height, etc.) in response to the stored biometric data and/or input. For example, a person may have their biometric data or characteristics stored in a memory of control 118, and may select a particular code or setting corresponding to their data (such as âposition 1â of the seat adjustment system), whereby control 118 adjusts the adjustment mechanism of the particular selected seat in response to the data. Alternately, a person may have their biometric data or characteristics stored in a portable device (such as a key fob, PDA, or the like) or at a remote location or device, and may have the biometric data or characteristic communicated to the control 118, whereby control 118 may adjust the adjustment mechanism of the particular selected seat in response to the communication. The control 118 may also be operable to control or adjust a setting of an interior rearview mirror 122, an exterior rearview mirror or mirrors 124, a steering wheel 126 and/or the like in response to the input or communication.
The present invention thus provides a vehicle seat adjustment in response to biometric data, such as various body dimensions, weight, sex, age and the like. Such body dimension measurements, such as those taken for ordering clothing, may be made on a person and may be contained in the person's computer or the like, along with other biometric data or characteristics of the person (and optionally may include preferences of the person). These data may be loaded into the vehicle computer and/or seat adjustment system. The seat adjustment system receives the data and may be operable to pre-adjust the driver seat (or passenger seat or other seat) of the vehicle in response to the data so that the seat that the person will sit in is set to the person's precise body measurements and other data. Additionally, the adjustment system may pre-adjust an interior rearview mirror, exterior rearview mirror or mirrors, steering wheel and/or the like in response to the measurements or inputs.
The body dimensions may be saved in a person's computer or PDA, such as done for ordering clothing. Such measurement and saving technology now exists and is used by some catalogues, such as Lands' End and/or Levi (which provides for measurements in their stores and these measurements are stored in the person's file for ordering perfect fit jeans). Alternately, a vehicle dealer may perform simple measurements on a person (like a tailor with a new suit). This information may then be used to adjust the seat in the person's vehicle to the person's body size, weight, age, sex, etc. For example, the vehicle dealer may download the information or data for a person or person's (such as a driver and their spouse) into memory positions 1 and 2 of a vehicle seat adjustment memory of the person's vehicle. Optionally, the data may be downloaded into a Bluetooth (or other communication protocol) enabled phone, PDA or key fob, which may then be used to communicate the data to the targeted vehicle. Such an approach would be particularly suitable for and advantageous to use with rental cars.
The biometric seat adjustment system preferably utilizes the normal memory seat adjustment system or mechanisms currently in some vehicles, such as high end vehicles. While the seats today can be adjusted to a person's particular preferences, it is likely that most people take a while to get themselves comfortable. By using a few body dimensions and the person's weight (and maybe other information or characteristics as well), the present invention may set the seat or seats substantially perfectly before or when the person or persons first get into the vehicle.
It is envisioned that the biometric data measurement event may occur in the vehicle (such as by an in-vehicle laser or similar scanners and/or cameras that measure the driver's and/or passengers' biometric dimensions). Alternately, the biometric data may be measured external to the vehicle (such as at a dealership âboothâ when the driver is ordering and/or receiving delivery of the vehicle or at a biometric measurement booth at a Mall or other store or facility or the like) and may be provided to the vehicle in a manner such as described above and/or via, for example, an ONSTARÂ® telematics service or via a similar telecommunication system or event or the like.
It is further envisioned that more than the seat or seats (lumbar support/seat travel/seat height etc.) may be adjusted in response to the individual biometric data stored in or communicated to the vehicle memory system. For example, exterior and/or interior mirror reflective elements may be moved or adjusted in response to such stored or input biometrics data, which may be called up or loaded when that particular individual sits in one of the seats of the vehicle. Additionally, other accessories or systems of the vehicle may be adjusted or customized, such as suspension characteristics; steering column tilt; size of display characters (for example, older drivers may desire larger alphanumerical display digits); and/or the like, in response to the biometric data of a particular individual.
Therefore, the present invention provides a navigation system which is operable to provide step-by-step instructions to a targeted destination to a driver of a vehicle while the driver is driving the vehicle toward the targeted destination. The instructions are downloaded from a remote database at a remote service center or the like via a telematics system or wireless communication system of the vehicle. The instructions may then be provided to the driver only as needed by the driver, since they are coded or associated with or linked to particular geographic locations or waypoints, thereby simplifying the instructions so that the driver will be able to understand each step and execute the step accordingly. The present invention may also provide a seat adjustment function that automatically adjusts the seat of the vehicle in response to data communicated to the vehicle via a telematics system or a global positioning system or the like. The seat adjustment system or function may be operable to adjust the seat of the vehicle in response to biometric data of the person occupying the seat. The interior and/or exterior rearview mirrors may also be adjusted in response to the data or seat adjustments.
Changes and modifications in the specifically described embodiments may be carried out without departing from the principles of the present invention, which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims as interpreted according to the principles of patent law.
