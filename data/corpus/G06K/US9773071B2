BACKGROUND
1. Field
The present invention relates to a system and a method for providing mobile services using a code pattern, and specifically, to a system and a method for providing mobile services, for example, a content providing service, a geographical information providing service, a product information providing service, a taxi call service, a personal contact information providing service, a payment service etc, using the code pattern.
2. Description of the Related Technology
Recently, mobile terminals have been widely used and mobile communication technologies are also being rapidly developed. Further, various mobile services using mobile terminals are being developed. However, there are still needs for a new mobile service to provide various content more conveniently and to allow users to use various services more easily.
Now, it has been common that companies, which have their own websites, provide their URL information along with product information in advertising their products in a newspaper, magazine or catalog. This can be an effective marketing method over a conventional advertisement method, which does not provide such website information, in that customers can visit the websites and obtain more information about the products that they are considering purchasing.
However, in reality, it is less likely that a person, who reads the advertisement having the URL information, remembers or writes down the URL, and visits the Internet site and buys the product from the website since it is not convenient to memorize the website address. So, there has been a need to effectively induce a person who reads the advertisement having website information to actually buy the product.
Travelers carry a guidebook when they travel. But, due to a limited space, guidebooks generally do not provide detailed and helpful information. Particularly, when those books contain certain foreign language information, travelers usually do not find those books very helpful.
Furthermore, when travelers try to visit, e.g., a specific building, certain publicly available directions, for example, shown at a subway station, to the building, may not be sufficient for them to find the place. Thus, there has been a demand for conveniently providing sufficient travel information to travelers.
Recently, according to the development of mobile communication technology and the spread of mobile terminals, a transportation calling service using a mobile terminal is being used. However, a user cannot use this service if he does not know the telephone number of a calling service company. Even if a user (traveler) knows the contact information, he may have difficulty in explaining his location if he is a stranger in that area. Thus, there has been a demand for conveniently providing a taxi calling service with the use of a mobile terminal.
Meanwhile, a bar code has been extensively used in many places, such as retail stores and book stores. Recently, a business card, containing a bar code for, e.g., telephone number, has been developed. The bar code can be used to call or store the telephone number in a mobile terminal. However, to do so, a bar code reader is required to be either embedded in or connected to a mobile terminal.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE EMBODIMENTS
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. The same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components.
 FIG. 1 is a view showing the construction of a content providing system using a barcode 60 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
As shown in FIG. 1, the content providing system using the barcode 60 according to the present invention comprises a user terminal 10, a service provider server 130 and a plurality of Web servers 150.
The user terminal 10, which is a mobile communication terminal connected to the service provider server 130 through a communication network 20 including a wireless communication network and a wired communication network, transmits and receives information to and from the service provider 130 through the communication network 20. A wireless communication terminal, such as a mobile phone, a Personal Communications Service (PCS) and a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), can be used as the user terminal 10. The terminal 10 used in the present invention has a function of reading and decoding the barcode 60, so that the terminal 10 reads the barcode 60 printed on a printed matter, such as a newspaper or a magazine, extracts Uniform Resource Locator (URL) information recorded on the barcode 60 and accesses the service provider server 130, or extracts code information and transmits the extracted code information to the service provider 130 through the communication network 20. In this case, the URL information may be the numeric URL of a corresponding domain. The detailed construction of the user terminal 10 will be described later with reference to FIG. 3. Further, a Personal Computer (PC) or a notebook computer, as well as a mobile terminal, can be used as the user terminal 10.
The service provider server 130 is a computer provided in a service provider that provides the content providing service of the present invention, and functions to extract corresponding content and transmit the content to the user terminal 10, or extract the information of a Web page, providing the corresponding content, and transmit the Web page information to the user terminal 10, if a content request message is received from the user terminal 10 through the communication network 20. In this case, the service provider server 130 may be the computer of a service provider independent of a communication service provider (not shown) that provides the communication network 20, or the computer of a communication service provider if the communication service provider personally provides the service using the communication network 20 and the computer thereof.
The Web server 150 is a computer provided in a service provider that has content related to information recorded on the barcode, and functions to extract Web page information corresponding to a Web page information request message received from the user terminal 10 and provide the Web page information to the user terminal 10. That is, the Web server 150 is used when the service provider server 130 has information on Web servers, including corresponding content, without personally providing the content providing, service.
 FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the internal construction of the service provider server 130 of FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 2, the service provider server 130 includes a code distribution unit 132, a barcode image analyzing unit 133, a code information analyzing unit 135, a transmitting/receiving unit 136, a code information database managing unit 137 and a control unit 134.
The code distribution unit 132, which is adapted to analyze a service identifier 91 included in a content request message 90 received from the user terminal 10 and classify service types, analyzes the service identifier 91, recognizes that a service type is the content providing service, and transmits a received barcode image or code information to the barcode image transmitting unit 133 or the code information analyzing unit 135 according to embodiments.
The barcode image analyzing unit 133 is adapted to receive a barcode image photographed by a photographing unit (11 of FIG. 3), extract code information from the barcode image and transmit the code information to the code information analyzing unit 135 in a case where a decoder 13 for decoding the barcode 60 is not provided in the user terminal 10.
The code information analyzing unit 135 functions to analyze code information 95 received from the code distribution unit 132 or the barcode image analyzing unit 133 and extract the information of a Web page, including content information, from the analyzed code information. The code information analyzing unit 135 extracts the Web page information corresponding to the code information 95 with reference to the code information database 140 storing therein user contact information corresponding to the code information 95.
The transmitting/receiving unit 136 functions to receive the content information request message 90 from the user terminal 10, and transmit extracted content information or Web page information to the user terminal 10.
The code information database managing unit 137 functions to manage the code information database 137 storing therein the Web page information of a Web server 150 corresponding to the code information 95.
The control unit 134, which is adapted to control the respective components, generates control signals required to control the barcode image analyzing unit 133 and the code information analyzing unit 135, extracts content corresponding to the received content request message 90, and transmits the content to the transmitting/receiving unit 136.
 FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the internal construction of the user terminal 10 used in one embodiment of the present invention.
As shown in FIG. 3, the user terminal 10 used in the present invention includes a photographing unit 11, a decoder 13, a control unit 15, a user interface unit 17 and a transmitting/receiving unit 19. In FIG. 3, for convenience of description, components equal to those of a typical mobile terminal are omitted, but only components related to the present invention are depicted.
The photographing unit 11, which is a means for recognizing or photographing an image, functions to recognize (or photograph) the barcode 60, convert recognized (photographed) analog image data into digital image data, and transmit the digital image data to the decoder 13 in the present invention. The photographing unit 11 can be internally or externally provided in or on the user terminal 10. A scanner, a PC camera, a digital camera, a Web camera or the like can be used as the photographing unit 11.
The decoder 13 functions to analyze digital image data received from the photographing unit 11 and extract code information from the analyzed digital image data. The decoder 13 can be implemented with a one-dimensional or two-dimensional code recognizer depending on the type of the barcode 60. The code information extracted by the decoder 13 may be a preset code value. However, in other embodiments of the present invention, such as a third embodiment which will be described later, the user terminal 10 may not include the decoder 13. In this way, the user can be provided with the content providing service of the present invention using a conventional user terminal 10 equipped with a camera. In this case, the service provider server 130 should include a component for decoding.
The user interface unit 17 is a part to provide an interface between the user and the user terminal 10. In detail, the user interface unit 17 functions to provide a user interface so that the user can access the service provider server 130 to be provided with Internet content. Further, the user interface unit 17 functions to provide the user interface so that the user can access a corresponding Web server when Web page information is received from the service provider server 130. A Web browser is generally used as the user interface unit 17. Currently, a second-generation mobile communication terminal and a third-generation mobile communication terminal, such as a mobile terminal for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2000, have therein a wireless Web browser to support the downloading of multimedia data, such as moving images. Such a wireless Web browser generally supports a wireless Internet function using a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which is a protocol designed to simplify the amount of data to be processed so as to implement an Internet browser function in a mobile terminal having limitations in display and memory capacity.
The transmitting/receiving unit 19 functions to transmit the user content request message 90, including the code information 95 received from the decoder 13, to the service provider server 130. Further, the transmitting/receiving unit 19 transmits a barcode issue request message, including user contact information, to the service provider server 130 at a barcode issuing step.
The control unit 15, which is used to control the respective components, generates a photographing control signal and transmits the photographing control signal to the photographing unit 11 when a photographing button is pressed by the user, generates a decoding control signal, transmits the decoding control signal to the decoder 13, and transmits a transmission/reception control signal to the transmitting/receiving unit 19 so that the user content request message 90 is transmitted to the service provider server 130.
In FIG. 3, an example of the barcode 60 is depicted. The barcode 60 includes a one-dimensional barcode, and a PDF-417 code, a QR code and a data matrix, which are two-dimensional barcodes, depending on the type of the barcode 60.
The barcode 60, which is widely used at the present time, is a one-dimensional barcode capable of representing only simple and limited information, such as alphabet letters and numeric characters. In contrast, the two-dimensional barcode is implemented in a plane form by arranging data horizontally and vertically, and is capable of representing even the Korean alphabet and image. In the present invention, the two-dimensional barcode is used to record a large amount of information in the present invention.
 FIG. 4 is a view conceptually showing the data configuration of the user content request message 90.
As shown in FIG. 4, in the user content request message 90, a service identifier 91, terminal information 93 and code information 95 are recorded.
The service identifier 91 is a part on which the type of a service the service provider server 130 should provide is to be recorded. The service provider server 130 can provide a plurality of services, which can utilize the barcode 60, for example, a content providing service, a taxi call service, an advertising service and a commodity purchase connecting service. For example, four bits are allocated to the service identifier 91, so that 0001, 0010, 0011 and 0100 can be used as identifiers to represent the taxi call service, the advertising service, the purchase connecting service, and the content providing service, respectively. In this case, the number of bits allocated to the service identifier 91 can be properly changed depending on the type of the service which the service provider server 130 provides, or if necessary.
The terminal information 93 is the phone number of the user terminal 10.
The code information 95 is generated by decoding the barcode 60 in the decoder 13 in the user terminal 10, and includes the information of a Web page having content related to the barcode. However, this data configuration is only an embodiment. In a first embodiment which will be described later (when the service provider server 130 personally provides content), code information is not necessary, and in a third embodiment (when the user terminal 10 is not provided with the decoder 13), a barcode image, not code information, may be included in the content request message 90.
 FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a content providing method using a barcode according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The first embodiment shows a case where the user terminal 10 is provided with the decoder 13.
First, the user terminal 10 photographs a barcode 60 printed on a printed matter at step S500. For example, the user selects a barcode menu on the user terminal 10, presses a photographing button, and then photographs the barcode 60 printed on the printed matter using the photographing unit 11, such as a camera provided in the terminal.
The decoder 13 provided in the user terminal 10 decodes the photographed barcode 60 to extract the URL information of the service provider server 130 recorded on the barcode 60 at steps S510 and S520.
The user terminal 10 accesses the service provider server 130 using the extracted URL information, and transmits a content request message 90 to the service provider server 130 at step 530.
The service provider server 130 analyzes a service identifier 91 included in the received content request message at step S540. That is, the code distribution unit 132 in the service provider server 130 recognizes that a service type is a content providing service by analyzing the service identifier 91.
The control unit 134 extracts corresponding content on the basis of a content providing service recognition signal received from the code distribution unit 132 at step S550.

 FIG. 13 is a first configuration view showing a system for providing a taxi call service using a code pattern according to one embodiment of the present invention.
As shown in FIG. 13, the taxi call service providing system using a code pattern of the present invention comprises a user terminal 10, a service provider server 1330, a transport service provider server 1340, and a taxi terminal 1350.
The user terminal 10, which is a mobile communication terminal connected to the service provider server 1330 through a communication network 20 including a wireless communication network and a wired communication network, transmits and receives information to and from the service provider 1330 through the communication network 20. A wireless communication terminal, such as a mobile phone, PCS and PDA, can be used as the user terminal 10. The terminal 10 used in the present invention has a function of reading and decoding the barcode 60, so that the terminal 10 reads the barcode 60 printed on a portion of a station, extracts code information recorded on the barcode 60, and then transmits the code information to the service provider server 1330 through the communication network 20.
The detailed construction of the user terminal 10 is identical with that of FIG. 3. However, the code information extracted by a decoder 13 may be a preset code value or URL information of the transport service provider server 1340. A transmitting/receiving unit 19 functions to transmit a taxi call message, including the code information received from the decoder 13, to the service provider server. However, if the code information analyzed by the decoder 13 is URL of the transport service provider server 1340, the transmitting/receiving unit 19 may directly transmit the taxi call message to the transport service provider server 1340 without passing through the service provider server 1330.
The service provider server 1330 is a computer provided in a service provider that provides the taxi call service of the present invention, and functions to receive the taxi call message, including the code information obtained by decoding the barcode 60, from the user terminal 10 through the communication network 20, and then transmit the taxi call message to the transport service provider server 1340. In this case, the service provider server 1330 may be the computer of a service provider independent of a communication service provider (not shown) that provides the communication network 20, or the computer of a communication service provider, such as KTF corporation of Korea, if the communication service provider personally provides the service using the communication network 20 and the computer thereof. The service provider server 1330 may include an index database (not shown) for storing therein a barcode mapping table so as to extract transport service provider information and station location information based on the code information received from the user terminal 10 in a seventh embodiment, which will be described later.
The transport service provider server 1340 is connected to the service provider server 1330 through a network in a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) or Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) manner. For such a network, there are the Internet, Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), etc., however, the Internet is most generally used. The transport service provider server 1340 detects the nearest taxi from a station where the user is currently located on the basis of the taxi call message received from the service provider server, and transmits a taxi call message, including the station location information, to the taxi terminal 1350 provided in the taxi.
In this case, for a method of detecting the location of the taxi, there can be used a method using cell ID which allows the user terminal 10 to inform a base station (not shown) of the current location of the user terminal 10 in advance and then enables a switching center (not shown) to detect the location of the mobile terminal, a method using a Global Positioning System (GPS) which tracks the location of the user terminal 10 using a GPS satellite, and a method using Advanced Global Positioning System (AGPS) which tracks the location of the mobile terminal in combination with the positioning information obtained by the base station through the combination of the cell ID method with the GPS technology when the mobile terminal enters the central area of a town having a difficulty in measuring through a satellite.
The taxi terminal 1350, which is a mobile terminal provided in a taxi, can employ a mobile phone, PCS, PDA or the like, similar to the mobile terminal 10. If the taxi terminal 1350 receives the taxi call message from, the transport service provider server 1340, the taxi terminal 1350 transmits a taxi call approval message, including expected arrival time information, to the user terminal 10.
 FIG. 14 is a second configuration view of a system for providing a taxi call service using a barcode 60 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
The second configuration of the system of the present invention is different from the first configuration of FIG. 13 in that the second configuration does not include the transport service provider server 1340.
In the second configuration of the system, because the functions of the user terminal 10 and the taxi terminal 1350 are equal to those of the first configuration of the system, detailed descriptions thereof are omitted.
The service provide sever 1330 tracks the location of the taxi terminal 1350, detects a nearest taxi from a station where the user terminal 10 is located, and transmits a taxi call message to the taxi terminal 1350, besides the above-described functions. In this case, the service provider server should have a location tracking device, or be provided with the location information of the taxi terminal 1350 from an external location tracking device. That is, the service provider server 1330 should be provided with the location information of the taxi terminal 1350 based on the cell ID method from a communication service provider, or provided with the location information of the taxi terminal 1350 from a GPS satellite. If the Web server operated by the communication service provider is a service provider server that provides the taxi call service of the present invention, it is possible that the communication service provider tracks the current location of the taxi terminal 1350 depending on the cell ID method through the use of the communication network 20 of the communication service provider.
 FIG. 15 is a view conceptually showing the information which is stored in the barcode 60 used in one embodiment of the present invention.
The barcode 60 includes a one-dimensional code and a PDF-417 code, a QR code and a data matrix, which are two-dimensional barcodes, depending on the types of the barcode 60.
The barcode 60, which is generally and recently used, is a one-dimensional barcode and is capable of representing only simple and limited information, such as alphabet characters, numerals. In contrast, the two dimensional barcode is formed to be expanded by arranging data horizontally and vertically, and is capable of presenting even Korean alphabet and image. In the present invention, a two-dimensional barcode is used to record a large amount of information in the present invention.
As shown in FIG. 15, in the barcode 60 used in the present invention, a service identifier 61, station location information 63 and information 65 about transportation service provider server are recorded.
The service identifier 61 is a part in which a service type the service provider server 1330 should provide is recorded. The service provider server 1330 can provide a plurality of services, which can be provided using the barcode 60, such as a taxi call service, an advertising service, a commodity purchase connecting service and telephone connecting service. So, for example, four bits are allocated to the service identifier 61, so that 0001, 0010, 0011 and 0100 can be used as identifiers to represent the taxi call service, the advertising service, the purchase connection service, and the telephone connecting service, respectively. In this case, the number of bits allocated to the service identifier 61 can be properly changed depending on the types of services which the service provider server 1330 provides or if necessary.
The station location information 63 is part which indicates the present location of the user terminal 10. Barcode maker records the number which is allocated to the station, in which the user terminal 10 is currently located, into the barcode 60.
The information 65 about transportation service provider server is a part which indicates the information about web server which the company, which runs taxi service, operates.
