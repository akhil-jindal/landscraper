BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In the prior art the primary methods of communication are primarily voice based such as by means of a communication device such as the telephone, cellular telephone or other mobile devices augmented as needed by textual methods such as handwriting. In recent times the communication methods have expanded to include such digital and electronic methods as e-mail with the ability to receive files of voice, audio, video and data files as attachments and the means for recoding, playing and or viewing these files. In the prior art these files are discrete and separate and do not necessarily exist as one composite file thus limiting utility.
However, the primary means of communication in the prior art is not visual based whereas human beings by nature relate better to image based communication and visual stimuli. Hence, there is a need for a high quality visual web comprising of images and videos. There is a need for a plurality of mobile devices including smartphones and glasses to aid in acquisition and presentation of this information. The ability of human beings to recognize an image and respond to an image may be far superior to other cognitive senses and may be preferred by itself and or in combination with other methods such as voice. The communication systems of the prior art have a number of limitations making communication between individuals that have a physical limitation such as a hearing impairment or a language barrier difficult. Consequently, it is desirable to have a means for communicating primarily by means of images coupled as desired by the user with one or more other methods selected by the user, such as voice, audio, text and data and other methods as deemed appropriate for the desired application. In the prior art the means for interfacing with a mobile device such as cell phone has certain limitations for data entry being key stroke based, pen based for touch screens or voice based. There is a need for image based communication since the integration of image acquisition capabilities with a mobile device allow for the sending and receiving of images on a mobile device. However, the prior art just enables the viewing of the images and does not enable the image to be endowed with different types of related information thus rendering the images of the prior art to have limited utility and no functionality that could be associated with the image and or launched by touching an entire image or a subset of an image such as a photo.
Further the means of acquiring images in the prior art remain limited. There is a need for multimodal and multifunction mobile device including intelligent electronic glasses and discrete image acquisition sensors.
The present disclosure is intended to solve the problem enumerated above and other problems. The present disclosure teaches multifunction mobile devices including smartphones and glasses that allow for computing to be better integrated into everyday activities. As an example, glasses worn on the face may allow continuous access to an electronic display. These glasses may further allow for continuous capture of images, video, and audio. These glasses may bridge the physical and virtual worlds and provide an augmented reality experience.
The present disclosure describes and teaches a novel method for constructing image network/augmented reality network s for efficient and intelligent communication between one or more mobile devices/intelligent electronic glasses/headset, stationary devices, servers and individuals using images as a medium of communication with related device profiles and user profiles. The present disclosure additionally teaches novel means for associating the image with one or more attributes and characteristics coupled with other forms of communication such as text, voice, data and other methods. The present disclosure in a novel manner leverages the ability to digitize all types of data inclusive of images, voice, text, data and other information enabling the establishment of relationships with the different types of the data components coupled with the ability to use the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset by itself and one or more servers in conjunction with the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset to deliver unique and novel utility not offered by the prior art.
The image network/augmented reality networks of the present disclosure are constructed enabling secure and trusted communication by means of encryption and other novel security features. Images by their very nature require the processing and storage of a large amount of digital data. Additionally, when an image is coupled with various types of other data such as text, voice, and digital data, the resulting combination requires significant real time processing and storage. The present disclosure teaches a novel method for enabling the real time processing and storage of images by means of the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset acting by itself and or in conjunction with other mobile devices/intelligent electronic glasses/headsets, and local, central and or network servers.
The present disclosure additionally teaches the system level means for associating the image of an animate or inanimate aspect with collateral information relating to the aspect acquired by one or more means inclusive of, image sensors, NFC and RFID tags also known as radio frequency identification tags to enable intelligent image network/augmented reality network s that are capable of being integrated into a larger digital network existing locally or on the Internet.
The present disclosure teaches the system for using the image that is displayed on a standard display or the image that is displayed on a touch sensitive display to be associated with various profiles relating to the image comprising of audio, voice, text, data, function and other information; further providing the means for actuation and control of functions and applications based on images and or subsets of the images being displayed.

In turn each object may broadcast using RFID or other means information about itself to glasses, phones, server, or other devices. This RFID may be a label and can affix it to other devices.
Alternatively, the label may be a bar code or other image. This label may be a physical or virtual label and may include a barcode or other identifier. A table stored on a server or other device may map the label to data about the object. An owner, gifter, seller, or other person or system may create a data table including object location and other meta data, including purchase data, purchase price, ownership, useful life, willingness to sell object at an offer price. The data set may also pull in real time data including current price used on various exchanges. These objects may be automatically placed on an internet auction for immediate sale. A user may set an aspiration price including for family heirlooms. This obviates the need for the owner to manually post these items on an online exchange.
A user may then use their interface component such as glasses or mobile phone to assess the value of all objects within a home or environment.
The camera mounted on the glasses, smartphone, vacuum cleaner, or other robot may automatically scan home environment. For example, a robotic vacuum cleaner of a hotel may constantly scan a room to determine whether any objects are missing. This map of objects and paths may also be posted to an Internet server or database.
In another embodiment, a user may move a virtual object in a display and have the object move in the physical world by a robot. For example, a chef may move virtual images of objects such as a tomato and a robot may move the tomato in the physical world. This may enable remote cooking for elderly people or friends.
In another embodiment, it may be that one eye or multiple eyes may be impaired. The display may alter resolution, magnification, and other factors by lens to compensate for physical deficiencies.
In another aspect, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset/watch may be able to convert spoken audio to text in real time and post the information on one or more displays. As an example, a conversation may appear in the left lens of the glasses as a person is speaking. In the right lens, a set of conversation topics or Internet search terms related to the spoken content may appear.
In another aspect, distance may be measured by modifying one lens and another lens to focus on different focal areas.
In another aspect, a camera at the top of the glasses may zoom in on a hands and a projector may display an image of a keyboard so as to allow typing on the air. A laser may be used to track the gestures. Alternatively an inward facing camera may be used to track eye movement to understand the focus areas of the individual and map these focus areas to the gestures or control activities.
In another aspect, eye-tracking may be enabled on a camera focused on an individuals eyes. This camera may be integrated into the intelligent electronic glasses. Alternatively, it may be a second camera on a mobile phone. This may be used to measure advertising effectiveness such as when an individual watches television or when an individual walks down a street and sees billboards.
Alternatively, eye tracking may be used for fatigued drivers and they may measure pupil dilation, eye strain redness and other factors to assess exhaustion and the potential of falling asleep at the wheel. Alternatively, the glasses may measure physiological problems for medical diagnosis such as glaucoma and cataracts.
In another aspect, the glasses may be used for gaming including scavenger hunts or other activities.
In yet another aspect, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may be used to control actions in a different area. As an example, a person may be at the office and wish to control appliances at home. The display may show the inside of the person's house and allow the individual to make gestures such as turn off and on lights in the virtual reality view. These actions and commands may be recorded by mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset, sent to a server, and in turn sent to a home server or the home device to implement the action. This may allow full home automation and control using the mobile devices/intelligent electronic glasses/headset from remote locations.
The glasses may be part of a network and allow a first individual to take control of another person's glasses. Glasses may be identified by IP address or another unique numeric or alphanumeric ID. In this instance, a user or system may login to the glasses device, update configurations and software, and change the camera acquisition activities and display. As an example, an individual wearing glasses that enters a retail store, may not find a retail store employee to help with a purchase. The store may allow for virtual retail assistants or avatars that can be activated on the display of the glasses or external display. This may allow for automated sales without the need for people. Other payment mechanisms including RFID, NFC, and cloud based storage of credit card information may be used to allow for immediate purchases of products.
In yet another embodiment, digital content may be recorded, streamed, or viewed on a time lapsed basis.
In yet another embodiment, objects and items may be automatically tagged with location, context, purchase, and other related data. For example this may aid a person in identifying where the person left their keys. Information about the last known location of the keys may be automatically recorded by the camera or tagged by the device. This content may be indexed and searched. Alternatively, it may allow a person to run a search query such as identifying all the items in house that were touched.
In yet another embodiment, various statistical, behavioral, and predictive models may be built based on the large or big data obtained from the input devices. As an example, a prediction function may suggest to a concerned family member the likely activities of a relative. Alternatively, a prediction may be made by a server on which types of people tend to look at certain objects and which types tend to ignore certain objects. This could be helpful for a real-estate ad-network.
In yet another object, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headsets and distributed camera arrays may be used as a security system. Multiple people may opt their devices into a centralized sharing server that may be searched and used for various predictions. This may be helpful in identifying erratic behavior.
In yet another embodiment, various micro-expressions and emotions may be detected by the facial expressions of a person.
In yet another embodiment, a camera may perform lip reading to understand spoken words when audio is not available. This may enable a person wearing intelligent electronic glasses to read the lips of a person far across a room.

As an example, an individual that is playing tennis may desire for the filter to provide more clarity on a yellow tennis ball and the white markings on the court.
In yet another variation the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may be enabled with training specific software. A laser configured on the housing of the glasses, headband, necklace or other external device may be used to assess the speed of objects or people. A laser on the glasses may target a tennis ball. A camera may image the tennis ball. A specialized miniaturized radio transmitter and receiver such as a radar gun including various radar forms could be used to determine the speed of the ball by transmitting a signal focused on the object, measuring the return signal, and calculating the frequency of the signal. The data captured associated with the device may be processed in real time by a local device or a remote server to predict the movement of the object. The predicted position of the object may be used to allow an individual more time to react to the object. For example, the tennis ball may be shown in glasses in a virtual representation as being closer to the individual than in the physical world so that a user may react more quickly to the ball if the user is shown to be responding slow to the tennis balls. Alternatively, the perception may be a calibration setting that can be configured on the glasses, a CT/MD, or a server. The speed of the ball may be displayed on the glasses, a CT/MD, posted to an Internet web page, or stored on a server.
In yet another embodiment, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may also be used in other sports such as golf. In this embodiment, a camera may image the golf ball, stroke, and distance of the ball from the tee.
Alternatively, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may be used in a football context where the ball may be measured for the appropriate spin, speed, and distance. In yet another embodiment, a biker may use the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset while biking on city streets or through nature. In this embodiment, the glasses may identify cars around the biker. The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may further provide a speedometer, acceleration, and various other statistics about the movement of the individual.
Example: Transportation and Glasses in Moving Vehicles
In yet another variation, the intelligent electronic glasses may be used in a car. The glasses may image the cars in front, on the side and/or behind the vehicle that an individual is presently in. The glasses may send the data to the CT/MD for further processing, a watch, wireless processor enabled necklace, server located in the car, or a remote server. The glasses may acquire the images of the vehicles in close proximity to the current vehicle, measure the speed of the neighboring vehicles, and track the trajectory of the vehicle. If a vehicle is moving closer than predicted by the system to the present user, the glasses may present a warning indicator on the screen of the classes; a spoken audio through the speakerphone of the CT/MD or car; a vibration of the phone or the glasses. A camera may further be integrated a car vehicle on the top and/or sides of the car. These images may further be sent to the displays in the car, on the mobile device, or the intelligent electronic glasses/headset.
The glasses when used by a driver may also be a tool to give feedback on the driving experience, potential for road hazards or incorrect driver behavior. The glasses may image the road ahead of the vehicle. The images may highlight potholes, sharp turns, obstructions in the roadway, animals, and other objects. The glasses may send the images acquired using the camera to the CT/MD or server for further processing or the glasses may optionally be configured with a higher end processor to perform some level of processing. The CT/MD may assess the danger of the object such as a pothole and suggest a corrective action to the driver. The corrective action may be a synthesized spoken audio command indicating the action to take or it may be a visual message that appears on the lens of the glasses or projected from the glasses onto the windshield of the car.
In yet another embodiment, the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset may be enabled with thermal imaging capabilities or with radiation scanner which identifies radiation such as terahertz radiation. This may be used by TSA personnel to scan a person in an airport or by local police to scan individuals in a crowd for illicit objects.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
These features and other novel features are described in detail to further illustrate and explain with reference to the appended figures.
Referring now to FIG. 1 in detail, describes a mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset 100 configured with standard features and or additional special features that define and enable the functionality of cell phones, laptop computers, personal digital assistant PDA, and other mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headsets. The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset 100 is configured with a display 101 which may be touch sensitive or alternately not touch sensitive. The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset 100 may be configured with a plurality of display windows and display types. The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset is characterized by one or more device profiles, 102, 103 and 104. The device profile comprising of information such as device model, device identification number, one or more mobile telephone numbers to empower the user to program and or select the desired device profile for the desired purpose and at the desired time. The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset user is further enabled to establish, modify and enable a plurality of user profiles, 105, 106 and 107 for use by itself and or in conjunction with the selected device profiles for the desired purpose.
The mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset is enabled with the capability to acquire images by built in camera or external means 109, send 110, receive 111, process with a built in processor 112, store information locally 113, recognize and compare image and other patterns 114, with the composite functions being represented by 108 for providing the needed functionality for wired or wireless communication of images and other information.
The image entity 120 describes the relationship between the image 130, and video 131 and other collateral and associated information which is defined as an image profile 121. The image profile 121, comprises of audio 140, voice/speech 141, language 150, text 151, handwriting 152, data 160, location 170, time 171, encryption 180, compression 181, description 190, function 191, behavior 192 and relationship 193.
The image 130 and video 131 can be expressed as purely digital data and all of the other information associated with the image profile 121 may also be represented as purely digital data. The digital rendering of the composite data creates a purely digital image entity 120 comprising of an image and an image profile. Thus an image entity can be efficiently communicated across a wired or wireless physical network, received and sent and further processed for the desired utility to form a virtual network composed of images and associated image profiles. As an example an image entity can be viewed just as an image only or activated to deliver voice, music or other functions by selecting the functionality by appropriate interface means such as touching a portion of the image, by voice command and or other means.
Efficient communication is achieved through compression and decompression as may be appropriate at the send or receive side of a device in the physical network. The conversion of voice, speech, text and handwriting is enabled by digital processing of the data at the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset level, the local server level, the central server level, the network server level and or the network server level to provide enhanced utility to the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset user based on mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset profiles and or user profiles. The behavior of an image by itself and or in relation to other images is capable of being modeled. The dynamic construction, storage and use of a virtual image entity is enabled by software means using the software, processing power/databases/lookup-tables resident within the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset and or in conjunction with the software, processing power/databases/lookup-tables resident in a physical network at the local, central, escrow and or the network server by fully leveraging the wired or wireless connectivity.
In the present system a plurality of device profiles and user profiles, with the capability to acquire images and related information by mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset means, capability to recognize the images and compare the images, and the capability to send, receive, process and store by wired or wireless communication means is described. The image further being described as a virtual image entity by software means wherein the image entity comprises of an image profile that associates the image with collateral information such as audio, voice, text, speech, location, time data, handwriting, encryption/decryption, compression/decompression, description, behavior, function and relationships to other images/aspects to form an image profile.
An image entity thus is unitized as a distinct and identifiable digital entity, said unitized image entity having embedded multimedia capabilities, location, security and executable functions that are inherently associated with the image with the added ability to launch the desired multimedia method for rendering and or actuating a desired virtual or physical function. The unitized digital image entities are linked together to form an image network/augmented reality network with the ability to send the selected unitized image entity across a physical network or across one virtual image network/augmented reality network to another and or propagate an entire image network/augmented reality network across a physical network to a mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset, servers and other devices for delivering utility to the user based on device/user profiles. The linking of image entities to form a image network/augmented reality network is relationship based, where the user defines the relationship or the relationship is learnt by software means based on the past user behavior patterns and potential user behavior patterns.
A mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset is enabled in the present disclosure to digitize and unitize an image entity by means of the software/processing power, storage/databases/lookup-tables resident on the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset and or in conjunction with the software/processing power, storage/databases/lookup-tables resident on the local, central, escrow and or network servers leveraging the high speed wired or wireless connectivity between mobile devices, intelligent electronic glasses and stationary devices. Currently, transmission across a digital network is by means of digital packets. The image entity is composed of digital data packets. However, these packets of digital data have a pre-existing relationship in the form of an image entity that is digitized and unitized. The image entity may be described as a super sized packet of digital data enabling the transmission of image entities efficiently across a network to dynamically construct/deconstruct and switch and rout image entities in an image network/augmented reality network.
Referring now to FIG. 2 in detail, the image entity 200, the image entity 210 and the image entity 230 form a basic image network/augmented reality network wherein the image entities are virtually connected by means of the relationship 231, 232 and 233. The relationship between image entities is defined and executed in software which is resident on the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset and or the servers. The relationship data is further stored in lookup-tables for enabling dynamic lookup of a relationship between images for providing efficient routing and delivery of the image and the image profile across an image network/augmented reality network.
Referring now to FIG. 3 in detail, a plurality of image entities, 300, 310 and 330 comprise an image network/augmented reality network with defined relationships 330, 331 and 332 which describe the detailed and specific relationships between each image entity. The image entity 300 comprises of sub image entities 301, 302, 303, and 304 that share a relationship with each other in addition to the parent image entity 300. The image entity 310 comprises of a set of constituent sub image entities that are labeled as 311, 312, 313, and 314. These sub-image entities share a relationship to portions of the larger image entity 310. The image entity 320 comprises of a set of constituent sub image entities 321, 322, 323, and 324. These sub image entities derive properties from sections of the larger image entity 320 and include certain attributes and parameters that are not explicitly part of image 320.
Referring now to FIG. 4 in detail, a plurality of super image entities, 400, 410, 420 comprise an image network/augmented reality network with defined relationships 430, 431, and 432. The super image entity 400 maintains relationships with image entities 401, 402, 403, and 404. The relationship between image entity 400 and 402 is determined by the relationship between image entity 400 and 401 and the relationship between image entity 401 and 402 and or other combinations. The image entity 420 and 430 may maintain similar or other types of serial, combinational and or hierarchical relationships with their respective constituent images.
Further referring now to both FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the foregoing architecture, system of organizing and establishing virtual relationships between various super image entities, image entities and sub image entities enables the dynamic construction of highly useful and relevant image network/augmented reality networks. The software for constructing, deconstructing, modifying and enabling of the image network/augmented reality networks may be reside within the mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headset and or the servers with specific protocols and complex algorithms being employed using the processing power and data bases of one or more mobile device/intelligent electronic glasses/headsets by itself, in combination and or in conjunction with a local, central, escrow and or network server.

Referring now to FIG. 6 in detail, the Image Switch/Router 610 comprises of an I/O processor, 611 for the processing of image entities as inputs and outputs; a digitizer and formatter 612 to enable the inputs/outputs to be digitized as needed and formatted as needed for further processing/send/receive/storage. Means for encryption/decryption, 614 of outgoing image entities, wherein each image entity may be encrypted at one or more levels of security and various sub image entities may be encrypted at one or more different levels of security for providing granular security.
The image switch/router further comprising the capability for pattern recognition of images by the image processor, 615, a means for comparison of images and image profiles 616, a general purpose processor and one or more special purpose processors, 618 for processing audio and other digital signals, a means for storage and means for establishing lookup-tables, 619 and an I/O manager for enabling the desired switching and routing across a physical network or the virtual image network/augmented reality network.
The inputs to the image switch/router consist of an image entity, 600 that further comprises of an image, 601 and an image profile, 602. The outputs to the image switch/router consist of an image entity, 630 that further comprises of an image, 631 and an image profile, 632. The foregoing architecture is for illustrative purposes and the novel features of processing an image entity may be executed by software by a single processor and other modifications to form an image switch/router for switching and routing of images in an image network/augmented reality network.
The image network/augmented reality network, 640 comprising of sub image entities 641 through 645; the image network/augmented reality network, 650 comprising of sub image entities 651 through 652 and the image network/augmented reality network, 660 comprising of sub image entities 661 through 663 are virtual entities that exist on the network at one or more nodes and storage devices. The entire image network/augmented reality network such as 640, 650 and 660 and or a specific image entity within these image individual image network/augmented reality networks may be swapped from one network to another by image switching and routing; and or generally sent across a physical network to a physical device by means of routing tables/protocols 670, 671 and 672.
The novel system of the present disclosure thus enables an image to be linked with its associated profile, the profile further having audio, text, data and other information to form an image entity that is purely digital and virtual; enabling the image entities to be linked together by a user defined relationship to form a virtual image network/augmented reality network which can be propagated across a physical network to a physical device for the desired display format and or further utility to the user based on device profiles and user profiles. The utility may be derived by visual means only and or coupled with other mediums such as voice, text and others since the image entity comprises of such collateral forms of information.
The actuation of the image entity may be executed by a plurality of interface methods to access the specific digital data individually and or in combination inclusive of the capability to launch an application that performs a specific function and or action, said functions and actions being virtually executed and or physically enabled. An example of this is by clicking on an image of a garage door the door may be opened or closed. Another example is the image entity may be associated virtually with another image entity. For example the image of a car, a car whose image is characterized and related to the home owner, that is approaching the garage from the outside may cause the garage door to open, since these two images are linked by a relationship that was previously defined and approved by the user. The garage door was physically opened in this example since the software caused a function to be executed. The behavior can also be learned based on user defined profiles. Thus image based networks of the present disclosure are of great utility and practical applications. An image based network may include still images and video.
Referring now to FIG. 7 in detail, a plurality of objects, 700, 710 and 720 comprise an object network with defined relationships 730, 731 and 732 which describe the detailed and specific relationships between each object. This forms an object network describable in software as an object network. The object when coupled with its associated descriptions, identification, parameters and relationships is defined as an object entity. The object entity 700 comprises of sub object entities 701, 702, 703, and 704 that share a relationship with each other in addition to the parent image entity 700. An example of this is a side chair of a dining table ensemble with four legs wherein the chair and the legs of the chair have a defined relationship that may be described in software as an object sub-network. The image entity 710 comprises of a set of constituent sub object entities that are labeled as 711, 712, 713, and 714. These sub-image entities share a relationship to portions of the larger image entity 710. As an example this object sub-network may represent in software an arm chair within the same dining table-chair group. The image entity 720 comprises of a set of constituent sub image entities 721, 722, 723, and 724. These sub image entities derive properties from sections of the larger image entity 720 and include certain attributes and parameters that are not explicitly part of image 720. The object entities 700, 710 and 720 form an object network that is virtually defined by a software program. The object network may be linked to various real images of the different objects to enable a real visual representation forming a virtual image network/augmented reality network that is of utility as explained elsewhere in the present teaching.
Referring now to FIG. 8 in detail, a plurality of super object entities, 800, 810, 820 comprise an object network with defined relationships 830, 831, and 832. The super object entity 800 maintains relationships with object entities 801, 802, 803, and 804. The relationship between object entity 800 and 802 is determined by the relationship between object entity 800 and 801 and the relationship between object entity 801 and 802 and or other combinations. The object 820 and 830 may maintain similar or other types of serial, combinational and or hierarchical relationships with their respective constituent objects.
Further referring now to both FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, the foregoing architecture, system of organizing and establishing virtual relationships between various objects that may be animate or inanimate is of great utility especially when associated with a real image or a virtual computer generated image enabling the user to visualize, design and even actuate the desired function of an object or cause a desired transformation of form and function of a physical object by remote network access means.

The object network may be transformed or modified automatically, based on device and user profiles and rendered for a specific purpose and or for a specific duration with the desired security levels. The security key for a virtual object network may be dynamically enabled by a mobile device acting alone and or in conjunction with an escrow server. The object networks may be interrelated with the associated image network/augmented reality network.
Referring now to FIG. 9 in detail, an object may be viewed from the outside from all 360 degrees of angle to present the best visual representation of its characteristics. At times it is not possible to obtain a full 360 degree view and a visual representation must be rendered by extrapolation means. A mobile device and or other devices may be used for image acquisition for obtaining a full or partial real and visual representation of the object. The object 900 with the associated object profile 901 forms an object entity. The object profile contains detailed information about the object such as object type, object identification by RF tag or other means, object relationships and other relevant information.
The object entity 900 may be viewed by a camera, image sensors or other image acquisition methods from all angles when physically possible to get an image with an associated image profile to form an image entity that best describes the object when viewed from that particular angle or vantage point.
