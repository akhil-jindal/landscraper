\LOGIC CIRCUIT (NEUTROPHILE) April 18, 1967 E. T. SMITHLINE- BLOD CELL RECOGNIZER 14 Sheets-Sheet 14 Filed Dec. 3l, 1963 mda United States Patent O 3,315,229 BLOOD CELL RECGNIZER Edward T. Smithline, Lake Mohegan, N.Y., assignor to International Business Machines Corporation, New York, N.Y., a corporation of New7 York Filed Dec. 31, 1963, Ser. No. 334,876 21 Claims. (Cl. 340-1463) This invention relates to pattern recognition and, more particularly, to the recognition and classification of blood cells. 
 The automatic recognition of patterns finds important application in blood cell analyses, inasmuch as manual interrogation of blood samples to be categorized is timeconsuming. Little has been done in the past, however, to adapt pattern recognition to this field. As a result, mass testing of entire population groups to detect the presence of disease has been impossible. 
 The present invention is directed toward a pattern recognition system primarily dealing with the recognition and categorization of blood cells. A slide containing a blood smea-r is stained and each of the blood cells thereon is interrogated. Specifically, the contour of each cell is detected to determine the size of the cell as well as its general configuration. Discriminating techniques are employed to consider for classification only cells of a specific shape and size. Following this, the cell is scanned to develop information concerning its internal features, e.g., the color of the cytoplasm as well as the presence and color of a nucleus and granules. The information regarding the cell size and shape and internal feature is utilized to classify the cell among the plurality of cell types normally present. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a cathode ray tube is employed to scan a slide containing blood cells stained with Wrights Stain. A typical raster scansion is used in a search mode to scan the slide. When the scanning beam strikes a blood cell, an alternate scanning mode is instituted. Specifically, the beam is caused to follow the contour of the blood cell. During this scanning mode, the peripheral length of the cell is detected to determine the size of the cell. Concurrently, the direction of movement of the scanning beam is detected to determine the general shape of the cell. 
Following the first complete encirclement of the blood cell, the scanning beam circles the cell a second time. 
During the second encirclement, selected scansions across the cell are employed to detect the internal features of the cell. For example, spaced horizontal scansions are utilized to detect the color of the cytoplasm, the presence and color of a nucleus, and the presence and color of granules. 
 Following the second complete encirclement of the cell, the scanning beam is caused to jump across the cell and to recommence the search scanning mode described above. The information regarding cell shape and size as Well as internal features for each cell detected is utilized to classify the cell.

The system of FIG. 2 
 The system of FIG. 2 recognizes, classifies and tabulates ilferent types of blood cells. The system comprises a lood slide scanner'72 which scans a blood slide contain- 1g blood cells stained with Wrights Stain, for example. 'he scanner is under the control of a primary scan control 4 which typically initiates a Search raster scansion across 1e slide. When the scanning beam encounters a blood ell, a cell following scanning action is instituted so that 1e scanning beam followsrthe contour of the cell. The rimary scan control is coupled to a cell contour length etector 76 which determines the peripheral length of 1e cell during a complete encirclement of the cell by the :anning beam. The detector 76 applies this information J a cell recognizer and tabulator 73. 
 During the encirclement of the cell, a cell contour line irections detector 80 determines the direction of movelent of the scanning beam and hence the directions of 1e various line segments which together define the periphry of the cell. This information is applied to a cell hape detector 82 and to -a secondary scan control 84. he shape detector determines the shape of the cell and pplies this information to the cell recognizer and tabu- 1tor 78. 
 After the encirclement of the cell, the secondary scan ontrol 84 is activated which causes the scanning beam 3 encircle the cell a second time. During the second enirclement, and when the scanning beam is travelling in elected directions, the beam is caused to scan across the ell in spaced scansions to determine the internal feaures of the cell. As the scanning beam scans across the ell, the internal features are detected by an internal feaures detector 88 which supplies this information to the ell recognizer and tabulator 78. 
 The cell recognizer and tabulator 78 classifies the 'lood cells scanned based upon the information regarding ell contour length, cell shape and internal configuration. 
raster scansion is discontinued, and contour-following scan 104 is instituted, which proceeds around the periphery of the cell in the direction of the arrow I106. 
 FIG. 5 shows the second com-plete encirclement of the scanning beam around the neutrophile 34. The beam commences from the point 102 after the first complete encirclement shown in FIG. 4. Selected horizontal scansions 10S-1, 10S-2, 10S-3 and 10S-4 are employed -across the cell to determine its internal configuration. During each of these transverse scansions, the circular motion of the beam is normally terminated. Each scansion proceeds from left to right in FIG. 5 and `occurs lafter a predetermined number of interceptions of the scanning beam with the periphery of the cell. For example, the scansion 10S-1 from left to right across the cell occurs after the fourth intersection of the scanning beam with the cell at point 3'4-2. When the 'beam hits righthand point 34-1, it is blanked and returns to the point 34-2 to continue its course around the cell. 
 In similar fashion the scansions 1084, `1618-3 and 108- 4 occur. These commence from points 34-3, 34-4 and l34-5, respectively, after every fourth intersection o-f the scanning beam with the periphery of the cell. The scansions across the -cell occur when the beam is travelling generally in the northwest, north or northeast direction. Thus, after the intersection 34-2, the beam makes only two more intersections 109 and 110 with the periphery of the cell while travelling in the northeasterly `direction at the top of the cell. These two intersections, `together with the two intersections =111 and 34-3 when the beam is travelling in a northwesterly direction at the bottom of the cell, constitute four intersections and trigger the line scan 10S-2 across the cell. 
 After the scanning beam has returned to the starting point 102, the beam moves across the cell to beyond point 112, and again commences the raster scansion until the next cell is encountered. 
 FIG. 6 shows the scanner 72 in detail. It comprises a cathode ray tube 1114 having a beam-forming electrode 116, beam intensity control electr-ode 118, Iand x and y `deflection Iplates 12@ and 122, respectively. The electrode 116 is connected to a terminal 124 which is supplied with a suitable potential. The control electrode 118, and the x and y deflection plates 120 and `122 are connected to terminals 126, 128 and 130, respectively, which receive signals, as will Ibe explained later, to control the `scanning action. A lens 132 images the beam within the tube upon the slide 90 `containing the dilerent blood cells t-o be recognized and iclassied. Light passing through the slide is imaged by lenses 134, 136, 138 and 140 upon filters 142 and 144, photomultiplier 146 and filter 148, Irespectively. The iilters 142, 144 and 148 are color separation filters which pass light only when light of the colors pink, red and blue, respectively, are imaged thereupon from the slide 90. `Light from the lters 142, 144 and 148 is detected by photomultipliers 150, 152 and 154, respectively, to generate output signa-Is at terminals 156, 1458 and 160, respectively. 
 The photomultiplier 146 detects all the light that passes through the slide 90 and generates a representative signal. This signal is clipped in a clipper 162 and applied to an output terminal 164. 
Primary scan control 74 FIG. 7 shows a circuit for controlling the search raster scan and the cell following scan of the scanning beam in the cathode -ray tube 114 of FIG. 6. As pointed out with respect to FIGS. 3 and 4, the beam follows a search raster across the slide 90 with a small circular motion superimposed thereupon. This is accomplished by x and y sawtooth generators 166 and 168 which generate sawtooth signals applied to x adder 170 and y adder 172, respectively. The output signals from the x and y adders appear at the terminals 128 and 130; the sawtooth signals produce the raster scansion across the blood cell 90. A 'blanker 173 connected -to the sawtooth generators 166 and y178 generates blanking signals at the terminal 126 (FIG. 6) for blanking the scanning beam during horizontal and Vertical retrace. 
 It should be noted that the distance between the active line scans 94-1, 94-2, 94-3 in FIG. 3 is typically chosen to be much greater than the diameter of the average blood cell. In this fashion, when a blood cell is encountered by the scanning beam and then interrogated, it is fairly certain that lthe cell will not -be encountered again when the search raster scan is recommenced. 
 The small -circular motion of the scanning beam is developed through the use of an oscillator 174 which generates a signal representative of sine kt, where k is la constant and t represents time. This signal is passed through an analog gate 176 inhibited by a signal applied to a terminal 178. Normally no signal is present at the terminal, and the analog gate passes the signal from the oscillator to a phase shifter 180, to an attenuator 182 and directly to an output terminal 184. The phase shifter 180 typically shifts the phase of the signal from the oscillator 174 iby 90, -thereby generating a signal rep- -resentative of cos kt which is applied to an attenuator 186. 
 The attenuators 182 and 186 normally do not attenuate the signals applied thereto, and the sine :and cos signals are passed unmodiiied to integrators 188 and 190, respectively. The output signal from the integrator 188 is representative of -cos kt, while the Ioutput signal from the integrator 190 is representative of sine kt. The cos and sine signals are applied to the x `and y ladders 170 and 172, respectively, to be added to the x and y sawtooth signals applied to the deection plates of the cathode ray tube 114. As is well known, cos and sine signals applied to the deflection plates of a cathode ray tube produce a circular motion of the beam developed in the tube. 
 Accordingly, the beam in the cathode ray tube follows the search scanning raster shown in FIG. 3, with the small circular motion superimposed thereupon as shown at 100 in FIG. 4. 
 When the scanning beam hits a bl-ood cell, las at the point 102 in FIG. 4, a signal is generated by the clipper 162 of FIG. 6 appearing at the terminal 164. From FIG 7, the terminal 164 is connected to AND gate 192, als( supplied with a signal from terminal 194, after inversior in inverter 195, and with signals from inverters 196 anc 198. Normally, all of the inverters energize the gate 192, and accordingly the signal from the terminal 164 is passed through the gate to activate a single shot (mono stable multivibrator) 200. The single shot generates a pulse signal of limited duration which sets a flip-o; (bistable multivibrator) 202. An output signal from the set iiip-op is applied to hold inputs 204 and 206 of x and y sawtooth generators 166 and` 168, respectively, to prevent the output signals from the generators from changing. Accordingly, the scanning raster stops, as at the point 102 in FIG. 4, after the blood cell is hit by the scanning beam. 
 The pulse from the single shot 200 is also applied to the attenuators 182 and 186 to attenuate the sine and cos signals applied thereto and hence to reduce the radius of the circular movement of the scanning beam. Typically, the radius is reduced many times. The duration of the pulse signal from the single shot 200 is chosen to be typically equal to 180 or one half the period of the signal from the oscillator 174. During this time, the scanning beam passes into and out of the blood cell 34 shown in FIG. 4 with a tiny semicircular movement. When the signal from the single shot 200 terminates, the large circular 'beam movement is reinstated since the attenuators 182 and 186 are no longer energized. The terminating single shot signal triggers a single shot 208 whose output signal is inverted by the inverter 198. The energized inverter removes an enabling input from the AND gate 192, preventing a signal from passing through the gate. The time that the single shot 208 is triggered on is generally equal to 30 or one twelfth of the period of the signal from the oscillator 174. This prevents a signal from the clipper 162 of FIG. 6 from triggering the single shot 200. Such a signa-l may be present if the scanning beam is still within the blood cell `when the large circular lbeam movement is reinstated. 
 The action of the circuit in FIG. 7 in controlling the attenuators 182 and 186 is the same as that described in the copending application of Evon C. Greanias, Ser. No. 248,585, filed December 31, 1962 for Electronic Servo System, assigned to the assignee of the present application. As there described, the circuit operates to cause the scanning beam to follow the contour of the blood cell, as shown by the scansion 104 proceeding in the direction of the arrow 106 in FIG. 4. The selected attenuation of the sine and cos signals produces this scanning action. The integrators 188 and 190 generate signals representative of the x and y coordinates of the scanning beam with respect lto the beginning point 102 shown in FIG. 4. These signals are added in the adders and 172 to the iixed signals from the sawtooth generators 166 and 168, respectively. 
 The signals from the integrators 188 and 190` are applied to null detectors 210 and 212, respectively, whose output signals are applied to .an AND gate 214. Signals from the null detectors are generated when the x and y coordinates of the beam with respect to the point 102 in FIG. 4 are zero. These signals are together generated, activating the AND gate 214, when the scanning beam makes .a complete encirclement of the cell 34 of FIG. 4 and returns to the point 102. At this time, a single shot 216 is triggered to gener-ate a pulse signal of limited duration applied to an output terminal 217, to `an AND gate 218, and through a delay 220 to a flip-flop 222. Successive signals from the delay 220 alternately set and reset the iiip-flop. In this instance, after the first encirclement of the blood cell, the iiip-op is set, providing an enabling input to the AND gate 218. The delay period of the delay 220, however, is suiiiciently long so that the ilip-flop 222 is not set until the single shot 216 has returned to its off condition. Accordingly, the circuit FIG. 7 operates to provide a second complete encircleant of the blood cell. 
After the second complete encirclement of the blood ll, the null detectors 210 and 212 again energize the 1gle shot 216. Inasmuch as the flip-op 222 is presently t, the AND gate 218 is now activated, generating an ltput signal at a terminal 224. The signal from the ND gate 218 is also employed to reset the flip-op 202, ereby removing the signal from the inputs 264 and 206 the x and y sawtooth generators 166 and 168, which :rmits the sawtooth generators again to generate the gnals producing the search raster of the scanning beam. oncurrently, the signal from the AND gate 218 is applied the inverter 196, which removes an enabling input to e AND gate 192 `and prevents the single shot 21M) from :ing triggered. 
 It will be noted that the x integrator 188 is coupled i a peak detector 226 which detects and stores the :ak magnitude of the x signal from the integrator, repre- `nting the diameter of the cell scanned. This signal coupled through an analog gate 228, enabled by the gnal from the AND gate 218, to the x sawtooth generator 56. Accordingly, at the time the search raster of the :anning beam :is reinstituted following the completi-on E the second encirclement of the blood cell, the signal om the x sawtooth generator is increased by the amount f the signal from the peak detector 226 to ensure that le scanning raster commences beyond the point 112, las lown in FIG. 5. By this time the inverter 196 is no nger energized, and the gate 192 is open to trigger the ngle shot 21N) when the next blood cell is encountered nd to repeat the cell following scanning action just escribed. 
Cell contour line directions detector 80 During the first complete encirclernent of the scanning earn around a blood cell, the signals from the x and y dders 170 and 172 of FIG. 7, representative of the x and coordinates o-f the scanning beam, are employed to de- :rmine the directions of movement of the beam. This 1 effect determines the directions of the line segments aat define the periphery of the blood cell. Referring to 11G. 8, an arrow 230 depicts the direction of movement f a scanning beam following a circular cell. The movenent may be broken into eight basic directions such aS J, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW. Of course more lirectional indications may be provided, but generally ight are sufficient to categorize the beam movement. 
 Referring to FIG. 9, a circuit is shown for detecting he directions of movement of the scanning beam. The ignals from the x and y adders 171D and 172 appearing .t the terminals 128 and 131i, respectively, are coupled o filters 232 and 234, respectively. The filters remove rom the x and y signals the components representative )f the relatively high frequency circular movement of he scanning beam. The signals from the filters are ap- )lied to latching analog gates 236 and 238 which are :nabled by the first signal generated by the clipper 162 )f FIG. 6 appearing at the terminal 164. This signal is generated when the scanning beam first strikes the blood :ell and the first encirclement of the blood cell is initiated. 
 The signals from the gates 236 and 238 are differen- :iated in differentiators 240 and 242, respectively. The differentiated signals are amplified in ampliers 244 and 2.46 coupled to clippers 24S, 250 and 252, 254, respectively. The output signals from the clippers 248 and 250 are representative of +de and x', respectively, i.e., the positive and negative derivatives of the x signal from the fllter 232. The signals from the clippers 252 and 254 are representative of -l-y and y, respectively, i.e., the positive and negative derivatives of the y signal from the filter 234. 
 The following table tabulates for eight different directions of scanning beam movement the values of the y and x derivatives. 
Tab1e2 l t l X NW -l- N l- 0 NE -i- -l- E 0 -I- SE S 0 SW W 0 For example, when the scanning beam is travelling in a general northeasterly direction along the periphery of a blood cell, the x and y components of the beam movement are both increasing, resulting in positive derivatives. 
 In FIG. 9, AND gates 256-NW, 256-N, 256-NE, 256-E, 256-SE, 2565, 256-SW and 256-W generate output signals representative of the different directions of scanning beam movement. The direction represented by each gate is given by the letters following the number 256. The following table is an amplification of Table 2, and designates the input signals necessary to produce a directional output signal from a particular one of the AND gates 256. 
TABLE 3 +V -v l -I-X -x NW Yes Yes N Yes No No NE Yes Yes E No No Yes SE Yes Yes S Yes No No SW Yes Yes W No No Yes It will be noted that the presence of any one or more of the derivative signals +y', -l-a'? and -r' for a particular direction is represented in Table 3 by yes in the appro-V priate column and in the row corresponding to that direction. A O value of any derivative input signal, for example, the O value of the y derivative for the direction E in Table 2, is`represented in Table 3 by the designation no in both of the columns -t-y' and -y' for the direction E. 
 The absence of a derivative signal results in the generation of a discrete signal through the use of an inverter. In FIG. 9, it will be noted that inverters 258, 260, 262, 264, 266, 266, 270 and 272 are employed for this purpose. For example, from Table 3 it is indicated that when the beam is moving in a general easterly direction +17 and -17 signals are both absent while the signal -I-:i: is present. In FIG. 9 the AND gate 256-E is accordingly provided with the signal -i-a from the clipper 248 and with the signals +y' and y from the clippers 252 and 254, respectively, after inversion in the inverters 264 and 262, respectively. 
 The AND gates 256, when activated, generate output signals at the output terminals designated NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W. 
Cell shape detector 82 The signals from the circuit of FIG. 9 representing the general directions of movement of the scanning beam in following the contour of a blood cell are utilized to determine the shape of the cell. It Will be noted from FIG. l that the blood cells there shown are generally circular in shape. The terms circle and circular as used herein, including the claims, are intended not to be limited to pure `circles 'but rather to designate curves that approximate circles as well as ellipses. The blood cells that are typically of interest in detecting various diseases are generally circular. Matter not of interest, such as the platelets 68 and the ruptured cell 70 of FIG. l, generally are not circular and may be distinguished on this basis.

 9 The present invention `determines whether or not a scanned object is circular. 
 In FIG. l() there is shown a blood cell 274 which is generally circular in shape. In following the contour of the cell, the scanning beam 100 generally moves in the directions shown in FIG. 8, with the sequence being N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW. FIG. 11 shows a noncircular blood cell 276. In this case, the scanning beam 100 striking point 278 travels first in a generally northeasterly direction when following peripheral segment 280. The beam next travels generally northerly when following the next segment 282. The next direction of beam movement, however, is generally northwesterly along peripheral segment 284. 
 It will be noted, then, that whenever the scanning beam is following a generally circular blood cell, the sequence of beam movement directions is given by the following diagram. 
Diagram 1 NW NE SW S E The initial beam movement may be NW, N,NE or E when a search scansion is employed that proceeds from left to right across a blood slide `and when the movement of the beam during the following action is in a clockwise direction around the blood cell. It is impossible to have an initial beam movement in any of the directions SE, S, SW and W unless the object is noncircular. The sequence of directions for a circle is obtained from Diagram 1 by starting at any of the directions NW, N, NE and E and proceeding in a clockwise fashion around the diagram. 
 The circuit shown in FIGS. 12a and 12b, which are to be taken together, and in FIG. 13 utilizes Diagram 1 in detecting whether or not a blood cell followed by the scanning beam is circular or noncircular. If the sequence of directions is as given in Diagram 1, the cell is taken as circular. If the sequence departs at any time during the following action from this sequence, the blood cell is taken as noncircular. 
 Referring to FIGS. 12a and 12b, signals representing the directions of movement of the scanning beam, as developed by the circuit of FIG. 9, appear at the terminals NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W. The circuit includes a plurality of flip-Hops 28d-NW, 28e-NE, 28d-E, The flip-flops 286-NW, 286-N, 28o-NE and 28o-E, representing the four permissible initial beam movement directions for a circle, are set by a signal applied to the terminal 224. This terminal is part of the circuit of FIG. 7 and receives a signal at the completion of the second encirclement of a blood cell, as described above. The signal from the terminal 224 resets the ip-ops 286-SE, 28o-S, 286-SW and 286-W. vThis readies the circuit for the next blood cell to be encountered. t 
4 The resetting of the flip-ops 28d-SE, 286-8, 286-SW and 286-W energizes one input of associated AND gates 288-SE, 288-8, 288-SW and ZSS-W, respectively. If, when the next blood cell is encountered, the initial beam movement is in one of the directions SE, S, SW and W, indicating a noncircular object, an associated one of single shots 290-SE, 290-8, 290-SW and 290-W is triggered, applying a pulse of limited duration to the associated one of AND gates 288. When one of these AND gates is energized, an output signal is generated a-t an associated one of terminals 292-SE, 292-8, 292-SW and 292-W. Referring to FIG. 13, these terminals are connected to an OR gate 294 which generates an output signal which is applied to another OR gate 296 and to a gate 298. The signal from the gate 298 sets a flip-flop 300, providing an output signal at a terminal 302, indicating that a cell of noncircular shape is being followed by the scanning beam. The flip-flop 300 was previously reset by a signal from the terminal 224 of the circuit of FIG. 7, following the scanning of the previous blood cell, after being delayed by a delay 304. 
 The signal from the OR gate 294 passing through the OR gate 296 is delayed by a delay 306 to thereafter set a flip-flop 308. The flip-flop 308 was also previously reset by the signal from the delay 304. The signal from the set tlip-flop 303 is applied as an inhibiting input to the gate 298 and to a gate 310. The gate 310 controls the setting of a flip-op 312 which applies signals to an output terminal 314 representative of a circular blood cell being followed. Accordingly, 4as soon as the OR gate 294 generates an output signal,l representing a noncircular blood cell, the gate 310 is inhibited, preventing the flip-flop 312 from ever being set and from ever indieating, during the scanning of this particular blood cell, that the cell is of a circular shape. Accordingly, the only output signal is that appearing at the terminal 302 representing a noncircular blood cell. 
 Referring again to FIGS. 12a and 12b, assume that the initial movement of the beam in following a blood cell is not in one of the directions SE, S, SW and W but is in one of the directions NW, N, NE and E. These latter four directions are permissible initial directions of beam movement for a blood cell of generally circular shape. A signal from the circuit of FIG. 9 representing one of these four directions of beam movement triggers an associated one of single shots: 290-NW, 290-N, 290-NE and 290-13, thereby to energize one input of an associated one of AND gates 316-NW, 31e-N, S16-NE and S16-E. The other inputs of these AND gates are already energized by the set flip-flops 28d-NW, 286-N, 286-NE and 286-15. The activated one of AND gates 316 sets an associated one of flip-flops 318-NW, S18-N, 318-NE and S18-E to generate an output signal at an associated one of terminals B20-NW, 320-N, S20-NE and S20-E. Referring to FIG. 13, these terminals are coupled to an AND gate 322 which generates an output signal if all of its inputs are energized. Accordingly, if the initial beam movement in followinng a blood cell iS in one of the four directions NW, N, NE and E, the associated one of the terminals 320 is energized, energizing that input of the AND gate 322. 
 Referring again to FIGS. 12a and 12b, the activation of one of the AND gates 31e-NW, .M6-N, S16-NE and 31e-E, representing a permissible initial direction of beam movement, resets all of the flip-flops 286 except the flipop providing an input to the activated AND gate 316 and the ip-flop `corresponding to the next permissible direction. For example, if the AND gate 31e-NW is activated, corresponding to a northwesterly initial beam movement, the flip-flops 28d-NE, 28o-E, 28d-SE, 28a-S, 286-SW and 28d-W are reset. The flip-ilop 28d-NW is not reset, inasmuch as this is the flip-flop that activates the AND gate 3l6-NW. The flip-flop 28o-N is not reset, inasmuch as this is the flip-hop corresponding to the northerly direction, i.e., the direction that follows NW in the proper sequence as given in Diagram 1 above. 
 By not resetting those of the flip-flops 286 corresponding to the same `direction of beam movement and the next permissible direction for a circle, the circuit is made ready to receive another signal representing these directions of beam movement. If any other direction of beam movement is produced, however, the associated one of single shots 290 is triggered, energizing one input of the associated one yof AND gates 288. The other input to the AND gate will be energized by virtue of the reset tlip-op 286, thereby generating an output signal at the associated one of terminals 292, `coupled to the OR gate 294 yof FIG. 13 and producing a signal at the output terminal 302 representing a noncircular blood cell. 
 For example, assume that the initial direction of beam iovement was in the northerly direction, causing a re- :tting of all the ip-ilops 286 except 28e-N and 286-NE. he next permissible beam direction for a circular blood :ll is NE. If, however, a northwesterly signal is rezived, the single shot 29tl-NW is triggered, energizing ne input of the AND gate 288-NW. The other input the AND gate is energized by the reset flip-flop 86-NW, thereby generating a signal at the terminal 924NW resulting in an ultimate output signal from the :rminal 302 of FIG. 13. 
 It will be noted that each of the terminals NW, N, IE, E, SE, S, SW and W is coupled either directly or irough an associated one of diodes 324 to the flip-op 86 associated with the next permissible direction for a ircular blood cell. For example, the terminal N is oupled through diode 324-N to the flip-flop 28e-NE. he terminal SE is coupled directly to the flip-flop 286-5. `his coupling of each directional terminal to the flip-nop 86 associated with the next permissible direction sets the .ip-flop to ready the circuit for a signal in the next ermissible direction. The flip-flop may have been pre- 'iously reset by one of the AND gates 316. 
 The action described above continues for all beam .irectional movements. For a proper directional sequence s given in Diagram 1, each new proper directional signal ets the next directional iiip-flop 236 and resets all other lip-ilops except the flip-flop for the same direction. If nything but a signal representing the same or the next lirection is received, the associated one of AND gates "88 is energized, energizing the OR gate 294 of FIG. 13 rnd producing an output at the terminal 332, representng a noncircular 4cell shape. If the sequence of beam lirectional movements is proper for a blood cell of cir- :ular shape, the AND gates 316 are energized in sequence ind all the terminals 320 of FIGS. 12a and 12b are ultinately energized. All of the inputs of the AND gate $22 (FIG. 13) are energized, with the exception of the erminal 217. This terminal is connected to the Icircuit )f FIG. 7 and is energized by the single `shot 216 at he end of the iirst complete encirclement of the blood :ell by the scanning beam to activate the gate 322. A aignal is generated which is applied to the gate 31) and o the OR gate 296. It the gate 311i is not already iniibited by the flip-flop 3118, which would occur if it had lready been determined that the blood cell is noncircular, :he signal from the AND gate 322 is applied through the gate 310 to set the ilip-op 312. The flip-flop 312 applies an output signal to the output terminal 314, indicating a blood cell of circular shape. 
 If it had not previously been determined that the cell were noncircular, the signal from the AND gate 322 passing through the OR gate 296 and delay 3% sets the flip-flop 308 to inhibit the gates 29S and 311D, preventing the llip-ilop 300 from being set and from indicating a noncircular cell shape during the remainder of the scanning o the particular blood cell. 
Cell contour length detector 76 FIG. 14 is a diagram of a circuit for detecting the peripheral length of a blood cell during the iirst complete encirclement of the cell by the scanning beam. A signal from the clipper 162 of the circuit of FIG. 6 is generated at the terminal 164 when the scanning beam iirst strikes the blood cell. This signal activates a latching analog gate 326 which holds itself open to apply a signal from the terminal 184 to a base clipper 323. The signal at the terminal 184 is generated by the oscillator 174 of the circuit of FIG; 7. The oscillator signal is responsible for the circular movement of the beannas described above, and passes through the analog gate 176 of FIG. 7 to the terminal 184. 
 Referring again to FIG. 14, the base clipper 328 clips the negative pulses, for example, of the signal from the analog gate 326 to produce a positive pulse for each 12 period of the signal from the oscillator 174. The pulse signals are applied to a `squarer 330 which generates relatively square wave pulses that are applied to a counter 332 for counting. Each pulse signal applied to the counter is representative of a unit length of the periphery of the blood cell being scanned. 
 For example, referring to FIG. 4, each pulse applied to the counter 332 corresponds to a different one of the intersections of the scanning beam 104 with the blood cell 34 following the initial intersection at the point 102. For the cell shown in FIG. 4, forty of such intersections and hence forty pulses from the squarer 330 are produced and counted in the counter 332 in one complete encirclement of the blood cell by the scanning beam. 
 The counter 332 operates to generate output pulses at different selected pulse counts. This is to aid in distinguishing the various types of blood cells encountered. Referring to Table l, it will be noted that the cell types there tabulated fall into roughly four groups, based upon diameter. The first group, occupied by the red blood cell, is designated by a diameter of 7-8 microns. The `second group, loccupied =by the lymphocyte, neutrophile, eosinophile and lbasophilc, is designated by a diameter of roughly 9-16 microns. The third group, occupied by the monocyte, is categorized by a diameter of 16-25 microns. The platelet and the yruptured cell constitute the fourth group and are categorized by diameters of l-3 microns and greater than 25 microns, respectively. 
 The following table relates the diameter of a cell to the pulse count from the counter 332 corresponding to the length of the perimeter of the cell. 
 For example, a cell diameter of from 7-8 microns corresponds to a pulse count in the counter 332 of FIG. 14 of from 21 to 25. It should be noted the pulse count depends upon the magnification of the lens 132 in FIG. 6, and the particular pulse counts in Table 4 are representative only. 
 In FIG. 14, the counter 332 operates to genera-te output signals on conductors 334, 336, 338 and 340 representative of pulse counts of 21, 26, 51 and 80, respectively. These particular counts are representative and may be varied as required in the identification of different cell types. 
 Output signals representative lof pulse counts falling within the ranges of the four groups of Table 4 are obtained as follows. The conductors 334, 336, 338 and 340 are coupled to flip-flops 342; 344 and 346; 348 and 350; and 352 and 354, respectively. 
 Consider a series of pulses applied to the counter 332 during a complete encirclement of a blood cell by the scanning beam. When twenty-one pulses have been applied to the counter 332, an output signal is generated on the conductor 334 which sets the flip-op 342 and energizes one input of an AND gate 356. Another input to the AND gate is received from the flip-flop 344 in the reset position. This flip-flop is reset unless it is set by a pulse signal on the conductor 336 from the counter 332 indicating a pulse count of 26. Accordingly, if the pulse count from the counter is within the range indicated in Group 1 of Table 4, the ip-iiops 342 and 344 energize two of the inputs of the AND gate 356. 
 At the end of the rst complete encirclement of the blood cell by the scanning beam, the pulse at the terminal 217 from the circuit of FIG. 7 lsets a normally reset flipflop 358. This energizes the remaining input to the AND
