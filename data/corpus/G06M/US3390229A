A I'ORNE YS United States Patent Otlice 3,390,229 Patented .lune 25, 1968 3,390,229 PARTICLE MEASURING AND COUNTING SYSTEM David A. Williams, Michigan City, Ind., assigner, by mesne assignments, to Raytheon Education Com pany, a corporation of Delaware Filed Nov. 1, 1962, Ser. No. 234,723 13 Claims. (Cl. 178-6) This invention relates to -a particle measuring and counting system and more particularly to a very efficient, accurate and reliable electronic system wherein the dimensions and numbers of particles or the like are rapidly determined from a video signal produced by scanning of an image area having images of the particles thereon. 
 rThe system disclosed herein was designed with the specic object of providing a system for the analysis of spray particles from a spray nozzle to determine characteristics of the nozzle and important yfeatures of the invention relate particularly to spray analysis. However, a general object of the invention is to provide a system having features usable in a wide range of applications, including the measurement of shape and dimensions of and size distribution of multiple images produced from blood cells, bacteria, electron microscope photographs of molecular or crystal structure, dust impurities, solid particles suspended in liquids, tracks of nuclear particles in bubble chambers, cloud chambers or nuclear emulsi-on, pits or ilaws on metal surfaces, etc. 
 The present invention involves the measurement of image dimensions by means of an intercept scanning technique which is disclosed and claimed in my copending application of even date, entitled Intercept Scanning System, Ser. No. 234,722. To measure dimensions with the intercept scanning technique, an image area is scanned to produce a video signal having pulses therein corresponding to images in the image area, and means are provided responsive to such pulses to produce output signals corresponding to dimensions of the images, Preferably, a conventional television camera is used wherein an image area on the screen of a camera `tube is scanned with a spot from a cathode ray beam moving in a line pattern. When the scanning spot initially intercepts the image, a time delay circuit is set into operation and after a delay on the same order of magnitude as a scanning line interval, a signal is applied to a interrogation gate to determine the presence of a video signal. If the video signal is then above a cert-ain amplitude, the time delay circuit is operated through another cycle. If not, the operation thereof is discontinued, Thus the number of cycles of operation of the time delay cir-cuit is a measure of the number of scan lines passing through a certain portion of the image and is a measure of its dimension, With particles having images of substantially circular form, such as particles from a spray nozzle, the measurement can be :performed in la direction perpendicular to the scanning lines, by using a time delay equal to the scanning line interval. 
 According to an important feature of the invention, the spray from -a spray nozzle is automatically analyzed by using flash illumination means to develop particle images in an image 4area which is then scanned. A specilic feature relates to the synchronization of the operation of the flash illumination and scanning means. 
 Further important features of the invention rel-ate to the provision of a multi-channel system for measurement of image dimensions wherein the size of an image may be measured in each channel during or prior to completion of the measurement of the dimensions of images in other channels, to thus permit rapid analysis. 
Another important feature of the invention relates t-o the synchronization of the operation of scanning means and the operation of time delay means u-sed in size measurement. 
 Still further features of the invention relate to the connection of the size measuring system to a system for indicating and recording the distribution of images according to size. 
 This invention contemplates other 4and more yspecific objects, features `and advant-ages Iwhich will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description taken -in lconjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment land in which:

 The illustrated system 20 operates to electronically analyze the spray from a spray nozzle 21 to determine droplet size distribution, so as to permit determination of the performance characteristics of the nozzle 21. 
 In the general operation of the system 20, a strobe ilash lamp unit 22 is energized to develop an image on the screen of a television camera 23 through a lens system 24 thereof. The image on the camera tube screen is scanned line-by-line by the spot of the cathode ray beam of a camera tube. For example, a horizontal scanning frequency of 15,750 cycles per second and a vertical scanning frequency of 20 cycles per second may be used, so as to give 787.5 scanning lines per field. 
 The principle of operation is illustrated in FIGURE 2 which shows diagrammatically the upper portion of a scanning raster with the vertically spaced horizontal lines representing the path of movement of the spot in the scanning operation and with the circles 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 representing the outlines of droplet images developed by the ilash illumination of the spray. To simplify and clarify illustration and discussion, the illustrated scanning lines are much fewer in number and are spaced much further apart than is generally the case in practice. 
 When the spot reaches a point as indicated by reference numeral 31 it intercepts the droplet image 25 near the top edge thereof and develops the leading edge of a pulse in the video signal. This leading edge of the video signal pulse initiates operation of a time delay circuit wherein the time delay is equal to the period of the horizontal line frequency of 15,750 cycles per second. At the end of one cycle of operation of the time delay circuit, when the spot is at a point 32 directly below point 31, an interrogation gate is operated. If a video signal of sufficient amplitude is then present, as is the case in this illustration, the time delay circuit is operated through another cycle to again operate the gate when the spot reaches a point 33 directly below the points 3l and 32 and the time delay circuit is then operated through another cycle to again operate the gate when the spot reaches a point 34, and finally the time delay circuit is operated through still another cycle to again operate the gate when the spot reaches a point 35. At this time, there is no video signal and the operation of the time delay circuit is discontinued after four cycles of operation thereof. The time delay circuit is then in condition to respond to the interception of another droplet. It will be appreciated that the number of cycles of operation of the time delay circuit is a measure of the diameter of the droplet image 25. By developing a pulse in each cycle of operation of the time delay circuit and counting the number of pulses, the size of the droplet images determined with a degree of accuracy determined by the spacing of the scanning lines in relation to the size of the droplet image. 
 As shown, more than one droplet image may be positioned on one horizontal scanning line, which could cause the system to miss droplets and operate improperly. To obviate this possibility, a multiple channel system is employed, with a time delay circuit and an interrogation gate in each channel. `In the illustrated system, five size sorting channel circuits 36-40 are used each having a time delay circuit and an interrogation gate. The outputs of the size sorting channel circuits 36-40 are connected to size counters 41-45 while the inputs of the size sorting channel circuits 36-40 are connected to outputs of a channel selector circuit 46 and also to the output of a video processing and shading circuit unit 47 which is connected to the video output of the camera 23. The unit 47 compensates for variations in port-holing or tilting and the effects of uneven lighting and also compensates for characteristic defects of the camera tube of the camera 23, which may preferably be a vidicon. The unit also operates to refer all video pulses (corresponding to droplets) tO a at electrical base line. In addition, the video signal is passed or rejected by an amplitude discriminator and those pulses which are passed are squared and the video rise time is checked to provide a basis for accepting or rejecting a particle for good or poor focus. 
 In the channel selector operation, the video pulse initiated when the spot is positioned at point 31 on the droplet image 25 is fed to the size sorting channel 36 to initiate operation of the time delay circuit thereof. Another video pulse is initiated when the scanning spot reaches a point 49 on the droplet image 26. Through the operation of the channel selector circuit 46, this pulse is fed to the second size sorting channel circuit 37 to initiate operation of the time delay circuit thereof. 
 In the next scanning line, the leading edges of five video pulses are developed at points S0, 51, 52, 53 and 54 on the droplet images 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 respectively. Through operation of certain blind gates the first two of such pulses are not fed to the third and fourth size sorting channels 38 and 39, since improper operation thereof would result, Instead, the video pulse developed when the spot reaches point 52 is fed to the third channel 38, the video pulse developed when the spot reaches point 53 is fed to the fourth channel 39, and the pulse developed when the spot reaches point 54 is fed to the fth channel 40. Thus the time delay circuits of all tive channels will be operative. With droplet images as diagrammatically illustrated in FIGURE 2, the time delay circuit of the first channel 36 will complete four cycles of operation, the time delay circuit of the second channel 37 will complete five cycles of operation, the time delay circuit of the third channel 38 will complete seven cycles of operation, the time delay circuit of the fourth channel 39 will complete four cycles of operation, and the time delay circuit of the fifth channel dt) will complete ten cycles of operation. Thus four pulses are applied to the first counter 41, live pulses to the second counter 42, seven pulses to the third counter 43, four pulses to the fourth counter 1M and ten pulses to the fifth counter 45. 
 At a point 55, the scanning spot intercepts the droplet image 30 to initiate another video pulse. At this point, the time delay circuits of the third and fifth channels 3S and 40 will be in operation. However, the time delay circuit of the first channel 36 and also the time delay circuits of the second and fourth Channels 37 and 39 will have completed their operation. This pulse is accordingly fed to the rst channel 36 to initiate another counting operation. 
 Means are provided for registering and recording the number of droplets falling into each of a plurality of size classifications, nine size classifications being used in the illustrated system. For this purpose, the size counters 4l- 45 have outputs coupled through coincidence gates to ten sections of a gating matrix 56 and through a code operated switch thereof to nine output lines which are connected to the inputs of nine tally counters 57-65. It may be noted that the number of sections of the matrix 56 depends upon the desired size capabilities of the system. In operation, when the time delay circuit of any one of the size sorting channels 36-4@ stops operating, after developing a number of pulses corresponding to the size of a droplet image, a readout pulse is applied to the associated one of the size counters i1-45. Signals are then applied through the coincidence gates to the associated section of the gating matrix 56 and through the code operated switch thereof to develop an output on one of the output lines to apply an input pulse to one of the tally counters 57-65. By way of example, signals may be applied to the tally counters 57-65 in accordance with the size of a droplet as measured in lines, according to the following table: 
Tally counters: Number of lines 57 4 58 5 59 6 60 7-8 61 9-10 62 ll-l3 63 14-16 64 17-21 65 21-31 For instance, if 11-13 output lines are registered on one of the size counters 41-45 when a readout pulse is applied, an input signal may be applied to the tally counter 62. 
 The actual sizes of the droplets so registered will of course depend upon the magnification of the lens system 24 of the television camera 23. By way of example, four optical ranges may be used wherein the 4-31 line range corresponds to droplets having sizes in the ranges of 20 to 130 microns, 100 to 650 microns, 500 to 3250 microns, or 2500 to 16,250 microns. 
 The tally counters 57-65 develops signals of analog form which are applied to suitable meters and also to a sampling switch 66 which is connected to a strip chart recorder 67. The sampling switch 66 may preferably be in the form of an electro-mechanical switch which successively steps through nine positions to succesively connect the analog outputs of the tally counters to the recorder. It may for example be operated at one step per second to apply a succession of DC levels of one second duration corresponding to the analog counts of the tally counters 57-65. 
 The recorder 67 preferably comprises a stylus motor responsive to such DC levels with a count of 1000 corresponding to full deflection of the stylus. The recorder may for example be set to run at the rate of 25 millimeters per second, to draw a line 25 millimeters long for the output of each of the nine channels, resulting in a bar graph depicting the size distribution of the various particle sizes. 
 To synchronize the operation of the camera 23 and the counting and registering circuits with the operation of the ash lamp unit 22, a timing generator 68 is provided which preferably divides a cycle power line frequency down to 20 cycles to control the vertical sweep of the camera through a line 69, and divides down further to four cycles per second to apply triggering signals through a line 70 to the strobe flash unit 22. 
 The timing generator 68 also generates horizontal drive pulses which are applied through a line 71 to the camera 23. The timing of such pulses is controlled from a high frequency oscillator 72, operated at 4.032 megacycles which is connected to the input of a divide-by256 circuit 73, pulses at the rate of 15,750 per second being applied from the output of the divider circuit 73 to the timing generator 68. 
 Referring now to FIGURE 3, which is a circuit diagram of the timing generator 68, the timing generator 68 functions to develop a four cycle per second strobe drive signal on an output terminal 75, a 20 cycle per second vertical drive pulse signal on an output terminal 76, a 15,750 cycle per second horizontal drive pulse signal on an output terminal 77, a chart drive signal on an output terminal 78, connected to the chart recorder 67, a monitor synchronizing signal on an output terminal 79, and a clock relay signal on an output terminal which may be used to energize an shown) which accumulates the total time that the system is in operation. In addition, the timing generator 68 generates a camera unblanking signal on an output terminal 81 and a video gate signal on an output terminal 82. The video gate signal is on only during the vertical scanning period of the iirst field immediately following the strobe ash. 
 ln operation of the circuit, a 60 cycle power line signal is applied to an input terminal 83 which is connected to the input of a Schmitt trigger circuit 84 operated at the 60 cycle rate. The output of the Schmitt trigger circuit is applied to the input of a divide-bythree circuit 85 which thereby develops a 20l cycle output signal applied through an emitter-follower 86 to a multivibrator 87 to develop a vertical drive pulse which is applied through a power driver stage S8 to the output terminal 76. 
 A 15,750 cycle per second signal is applied to an input terminal 89 connected to the input of a monostable horizontal drive multivibrator 90 Iwhich develops horizontal drive pulses applied through a power driver 91 to the out put terminal 77. 
 Vertical and horizontal drive pulses at the output terminals 76 and '77 are combined by an OR gate 92 and are applied through an inverter 93 and a power driver stage 9d to the output terminal 79 which is connected to a monitor 95 to apply a synchronizing signal thereto. 
 To initiate operation of the system, a start button 97 may be depressed to apply a signal from an input terminal 98, connected to a suitable voltage source, to an input ot a flipilop 99 which is then placed in a set condition. A signal is then applied through a power driver 100 to the clock relay output terminal 80. In addition, an AND gate 101 is enabled. A four cycle per second signal is then applied from a multivibrator 102 to a multivibrator 103 connected through a neon driver stage 104 to the output terminal 75. Multivihrator 102 receives a four cycle per second input signal from an emitter-follower 105 connected to the output of a divide-by-ve circuit 106, the input of the circuit 1,06 being connected to the 20t cycle per second output of the divide-by-three circuit 85. it may be noted that the multivibrator 102 provides a short delay from the output pulses from the divider 106 to the start of the strobe drive pulses generated by the multivibrator 103. 
 To generate the video gate signal on the output terminal 82, the terminal 82 is connected through an emitterfollower 107 and an inverter 108 to the output of an AND gate 109, one input of which is connected to the set output of the iiip-iiop 99u The other input of the gate 109 is connected to the output of another AND gate 110 on time indicator or clock (not Cil having one input connected through a selector switch 111 either to an output of the divideby-three circuit 85 or to a terminal 112 `which may be connected to a suitable DC source. The other input of the gate is connected to a set output terminal of a nip-flop 113 having a set input connected to a reset output of a iiip-op 114. A set input of the flip-nop 114 is connected to the output of the strobe drive multivibrator 103, while a reset input of the flip-flop `114 is connected to an output of the multivibrator 87 to reset the iiip-iiop 114 at the end of a vertical drive pulse generated by the multivibrator 87. In addition, a reset input of the -iip-liop 113 is connected to the output of the multivibrator 87. l'he operation is described below in connection with the Waveform diagram of FIGURE 4. 
 To generate the camera unblank signal on the output terminal S1, a flip-Hop 115 is provided having a set output connected through a power driver 116 to the terminal 81. A set input of the tlip-iiop 115 is connected to an output of the divide-by-ve circuit 106 while a reset input of the flip-nop 115 is connected to the set output of the flip-flop 113i. 
 Referring now to FIGURE 4, line 116 depicts the 60 cycle signal which is used to drive the Schmitt trigger circuit 84 which forms rectangular 60 cycle pulses as depicted by line 117. Line 11S depicts a series of 2O cycle rectangular pulses generated by the divide-by`three circuit 85. The leading edges of the 20 cycle pulses are used to trigger the vertical drive multivibrator 87, the output of which is shown by line 119. The vertical drive pulses are also used to blank the camera during the vertical retrace period. Line 120 shows a four cycle per second pulse train developed by the divide-by-ve circuit 106. The leading edges of the four cycle pulses of line 120 are used to trigger the multivibrator 102 which has a short delay and in turn triggers the multivibrator 103 to develop strobe drive pulses shown by line 121. The strobe drive trigger pulses fall within the vertical drive pulses of line 119 so that the strobe lamp is tired during the vertical retrace period when the camera is blanked ott. 
 Line 122 shows a video gate signal which is derived from the four cycle pulses, the flip-Hop '114 being set by pulses from the output of the multivibrator 103 and being thereafter reset by a signal from the multivibrator 87 at the end of a vertical drive pulse, hip-hop 113 being then operated to a set condition to enable the gate 110. The flip-Hop 113 is thereafter reset by the next 2O cycle vertical drive puise from the output of the multivibrator 87. 
 Line 123 shows an alternate gate signal which is controlled by the switch 111, wherein there is selected only the center one-third portion of the iield following the strobe trigger. 
 The video processing and shading circuits 47 are shown in FIGURE 5. The purpose of ivideo processing is to transform the analog video signal from the camera to a quantitized video signal wherein the peripheries of the particles are accurately dened and to determine whether or not the particles are suiciently in focus to be counted. In order to quantitize the video signal by means of the amplitude discriminator, it is iirst necessary to add corrective shading signals to the video signal and to maintan an exact relationship between the white level of the video signal and the amplitude discriminator reference level. 
 Shading corrections are necessary due to deciencies of the camera tube which is preferably a vidicon. These deciencies present themselves in the form of port-holing or darkening around the edges and might be caused by improper beam alignment of the vidicon, uneven target surface on the vidicon caused by defects in manufacturing or by beam landing errors generated within the deflection system. The shading waveforms are made avaiiable at both horizontal and vertical rates in the form of sawtooth and parabolic voltages. The vertical shading signal is generated by a circuit 125 having an input connected to an input terminal 126 which is connected to the vertical drive pulse output terminal 76 of the timing generator 68. The horizontal shading signal is generated by a circuit 127 which is connected through inverters 12S and 129 to the output of a monostable multivibrator 130 having an input connected to the output of another monostable multivibrator 131, the input of the multivibrator 131 being connected to an input terminal 132 to which horizontal drive pulses are applied from the output terminal 77 of the timing generator 68. The multivibrator 131 operates to provide a delay, preferably on the order of 2 microseconds, with the multivibrator 130 being operative to then generate a. pulse of a short duration, preferably on the order of microseconds. 
 The vertical shading circuit 125 may be constructed in a fashion similar to the horizontal shading generator' 127, except for diterences in time constants and the like due to the different frequencies of signals. In each circuit sawtooth and parabolic signals of selected amplitudes and polarities may be applied to mixing amplifiers. The sawtooth voltage may be generated by using a relatively long time constant RC circuit in the collector of a transistor amplifier, which may be applied to a split load amplier to provide sawtooth voltages of both polarities, one inverted with respect to the other. The desired amplitude of either polarity may then be selected by adjusting suitable potentiometers. From the push-pull sawtooth forming circuit, both polarities of parabolic correction voltages may be formed by integrating the sawtooth voltages by means of RC circuits. Here again, the desired amplitude of the proper polarity parabolic signal may be selected by suitable potentiometers and fed to the mixing amplifier. 
 The outputs of the vertical and horizontal shading circuits 125 and 127 are fed to a mixing amplifier 133, the output of which is applied through an emitter-follower 134 to an input of a video amplitier 135. Another input of the video amplifier 135 is connected through a low i pass filter 136 to an input terminal 137 to which a composite video signal is applied from the camera 23. 
 The lter 136 may preferably have a cutoff of approximately 2.5 megacycles and eliminates undesirable signal components and noise from the video signal. 
 The combined video signal and corrective shading voltages developed at the output of the video amplifier 135 are fed through an emitter-follower 138 to an amplitude discriminator 139. However, at this point, a key clamp signal is applied from a circuit 140 connected to the output of the inverter 129. The key clamp circuit 14) serves to clamp the video signal to a reference voltage at the beginning of each horizontal line. In order to achieve clean clamping of the signal, it is necessary that the clamping action take place well within the horizontal blanking interval, and it is for this purpose that the delay multivibrator 131 is provided. 
 An important feature is in the application to the key clamp circuit ot a reference voltage which automatically corrects for variations in a white level component of the video signal. In particular, the signal from the output of the lter 136 is applied through an amplifier 141 to a white level correction circuit 142 which applies a reference voltage to the key clamping circuit 140 through an emitter-follower 143. The white level correction circuit 142 may preferably comprise a coupling capacitor and a load resistor forming a network having a time constant which is a compromise between being very short for the eld rate and long compared to a horizontal period. The signal across the load resistor needs to have equal areas above and below ground potential and when the white level increases, the peak-to-peak signal out of the camera increases so that the portion of the video waveform which goes positive above ground potential will also increase by a proportioned amount. The signal across the load resistor is then clipped by a second amplitude disc-rintinator so that the video information is not included in the correction signal. It will be appreciated that suitable gain adjustment potentiometers are included in these circuits and with proper settings of video gain and white level correction gain, a change of 0.1 volt in the video channel will be mashed by 0.1 volt in the correction signal and -will therefore cancel when added at the keyed clamp circuit 149. 
 The output of the amplitude discriminator 133 is applied through an emitter-follower 144 to an amplifier 145 which may preferably be a four stage amplitier operating to amplify the pulses of video passed by the amplitude discriminator to a uniform level and thus produce squared-oit pulses. These squared-oit pulses are applied to one input of an AND gate 146 having two other inputs. One other input is the video gate signal from the output terminal 82 of the timing generator 68 which is applied to an input terminal 147 and from there through an inverter 148 to the gate 146. The remaining input of the gate 146 is a horizontal blanking signal which is applied from a multivibrator 149 through an inverter 150. The input of the multivibrator 149 is connected to an input terminal 151 which is preferably connected to an Output of the divide-by-l56 circuit 73, where an early horizontal drive pulse is generated. 
 Accordingly, the gate 146 is enabled during the vertical scanning period of the rst iield immediately following the strobe flash, except during the horizontal blanking interval, and passes the squared-off pulses from the amplifier 146. Such pulses are applied through an emitter-follower 152 to an OR gate 153 and also to a multivibrator 154 connected through an emitter-follower 155 to the OR gate 153. Thus the output ot the OR gate 153 is the additive combination of the video pulses plus a derived pulse from the multivibrator 154 triggered by the leading edge of the particle pulse. The purpose of the multivibrator 154 is to create a solid pulse for particles which may have a hole in the center of their image. 
 From the gate 154, the video pulses are amplified and inverted by an inverter 156 and 4are transmitted by an emitter-follower 157 to an output terminal 158. Terminal 158 is connected to the size sorting channels 36-40 where the signal is sampled at certain times by interrogation gates, described herenbelow. 
 The output of the emitter-follower 157 at the output terminal 158 is in the form of negative squared video pulses which are inverted by an inverter 159 and are applied to an AND gate 160 the output of which is connected through the emitter-followers 161 and 162 to an output terminal 163. The gate 160 has a second input connected through an emitter-follower 164 to an input terminal 165. A signal is applied to input terminal 165 which is the sum of tive blind gate circuits in the Size sorting channel circuits 36-40, and the purpose is to prevent pulses from being passed by the gate 160 if a counter circuit has already started to count the pulses corresponding to the same particle. Accordingly, a signal is developed at the output of the gate 160, and a corresponding signal at the output terminal 163, which is a positive squared video pulse corresponding to the first intercept of any given particle. Such pulses are applied as start pulses to measuring circuits in a manner fas described herenbelow. 
 A negative squared video signal used for monitor presentation is also generated in the circuit 47. In particular, an OR gate 166 combines the squared video pulses from the output of the gate 153, the vertical drive signal from the input terminal 126 and a horizontal gate signal applied from the output of the multivibrator 149 through an emitter-follower 167. This composite signal is amplified and inverted by an inverter 168 and is applied through an emitter-follower 169 to an output terminal 170v which is connected to the monitor 95. 
 The remaining portion of the circuitry illustrated in FIGURE 5 is for focus discrimination. The output of t@ the amplitude discrimnator 139 .through the emitter-follower 144 is transmitted to an amplilier 171 which may preferably have a gain control associated therewith. rthe output of the amplier 171 is differentiated by a circuit 172 and then amplilied by an amplifier 173 and applied to an amplitude discriminator or clipper 174. The amplitude of the differentiated pulses at the output of the amplier 173 is dependent upon the rise time of the video signal as it was passed by the amplitude discriminator 139. Particles which were in sharp focus have a fast rise time while those in poor focus have a slow rise time and produce low amplitude differentiated pulses. If the focus is suiiiciently sharp to produce pulses of large enough amplitude to be passed by the clipper or amplitude discriminator 174, they are then amplified by an amplifier 175 and are applied to an AND gate 17 6. 
 The gate 176 has a second input connected to the output of the inverter 150 which obviates the possibility of the blanking signal from the camera being passed as an in focus signal. The output of the gate 176 is applied to a multivibrator 177 which generates short duration pulses, preferably of 2 microsecond duration, which are applied through an inverter 173 and an emitter-follower 179 to an output terminal 180. 
 The functions of the channel selector circuit 46 and the size sorting channel circuits lid-iti are closely related since the circuit 46 operates to select individual ones of the circuits 36-40 as new particles are encountered. Each of the circuits 36-40 operates to measure the height or diameter of each individual droplet which is channeled to it by the selector circuit 46. 
 Referring to FIGURE 6, the channel selector circuit 46 comprises a ring counter which consists of five liipiiops 186-190 having outputs connected through emitterfollowers 191-195 to AND gates 19a-200 having outputs connected to output terminals 1-295. The ring counter is reset at the end of each vertical sweep by a verical drive pulse applied from the timing generator to an input terminal 206 connected to `all of the dip-hops 18d-190. 
 Assuming that the ring counter has been reset, only the output of the iirst flip-ilop 186 will be high and only the rst gate 196 will be open. The gates 19o-2d@ have second inputs all of which are connected to an input terminal 207 to which -a squared video signal from output terminal 163 of the circuit 47 is applied. 
 When a iirst particle is intercepted, Ithe squared video pulse will be applied through the gate 19d to the output terminal 201 and from the output terminal 291 to the first size sorting channel 36 to initiate operation of a time delay circuit therein and to measure the size of the particle. In particular, a signal is applied to an input terminal 209 of the size Sorting channel 36, shown in FIG- URE 7, to trigger a hip-flop 21d to a set condition. The set output of the iiip-iiop 210 is then applied through an emitter-follower 211 and through a voltage reference shift network 212, consisting of Zener diodes, to an arnplifier inverter' 213 where it is applied to a gate 214. The other input to the gate 214 is connected through an `inverter 215 to an input terminal 216 which is connected to the oscillator 72 so that high frequency pulses (4.032 megacycles) are applied to the gate 214i. The output of the gate 214 is connected through an inverter amplier 217 to a divide-by-ZS 6 circuit 218. 
 At the end of a time interval exactly equal to one scanning line interval, a pulse is developed at the output of the divider circuit 218 which is applied to a multivibrator l219. Multivibrator 219 generates a very short duration pulse, preferably on the order of l microsecond. This pulse -is applied through an emitter-follower 22% into an interrogation gate 221. The gate 221 has a second input connected through an emitter-follower 222 to an input terminal 223 to `which a negative squared video signal is applied from the output terminal 153 of the circuit 47. 
It is at the interrogation gate 221 that the video signal CTL liti 
is interrogated during each scanning line to determine whether or not a particle image is still present. The gate 221 will pass a signal only if both of its inputs are high. Since it is the negative polarity of the squared video signal which is applied to the gate 221, this means that during the scanning of a particle, the polarity of the video signal will bc negative so that the gate 221 will be in operative. As soon as the camera scanning has passed beyond a particle being counted, the video sign-al at input terminal 223 will then turn yto `white or positive. Accordinnly, the interrogation gate pulse from multivibrator 2i@ will be passed `by the gate 221. The output of the gate 221 is connected through an emitter-follower 22d to a reset input of the liip-r'iop 2id to reset the ilip-iiop 2id to its initial condition and to thereby close the gate 214. This completes one counting operation. 
 However, during thetime when a particle is 'being counted, each interrogation pulse from the multivibrator 219 and the emitter-follower 22@ is applied to an output terminal 225 which is connected to the size counter circuit 41. The circuit d1 then counts the number of pulses and determines the size of the particle being counted. 
 The circuit 35 also functions to form a blind gate pulse. In particular, an early pulse is taken from the divide-by- 256 circuit 218 on a line 226 when a count of less than 256 is reached,.preferably on the order of 240. This early pulse on line 226 triggers a multivibrator 227 which forms a blind gate pulse', preferably about 8 microseconds in duration. This pulse is shaped by an amplifier inverter 223 and is applied through a diode 229 to an output terminal 230. Terminal 23h and like terminals of 'the other size sorting channel circuits 374th are connected to the terminal 165 of the circuit 47, and the diode 229 together with like diodes of the other size sorting channel circuits form an OR gate. With the blind gate pulse from multivibrator 227 starting four microseconds ahead of the center line of a particle and having a duration of eight microseconds, it Will be seen that it bridges or encloses any particle which has a diameter of up to a diameter corresponding to eight microseconds, or 32 pulses at the 4.032 megacycle rate. 
 The in focus pulses from output terminal of the circuit 47 are applied to an input terminal 231 of the size sorting channel circuit 36 and also to like terminals of the other size sorting channel circuits. 37-40. Such in focus pulses are passed by an emitter-:follower 232 and are applied to a gate 233 having a second input connected through an emitter-follower 234i and an inverter 235 to the output of the inverter 223, at which the blind gate signal is developed. Accordingly, the gate 233;' passes only in focus pulses which occur within the blind gate signal generated within the circuit 36. This is used to enable a size count transfer in a manner as described hereinbelow. 
 -0n the first interrogation pulse occurring after the scannlng has passed through a particle image being measured, an output is present at the interrogation gate 221 which resets the flip-flop 2id, as above noted, gate 211i being then closed to stop operation of the divider circuit 213. At this time, the reset output of the hip-flop 21d goes high and it is applied to a multivibrator 2-35 which after a certain delay produces `an output which is applied to a second multivibrator 236. Multivi'brator 2.36 produces a read pulse which is applied through an emitter-follower 237 to an output terminal 232i connected to the size countter circuit 41. 
 To advance the channel selector to enable the second size sorting channel circuit 37 to start counting a second particle, the set output from the iiip-tiop 2id, applied through the emitter-follower Ztl, is differentiated by a circuit 239 and applied to an output terminal 24d. Output terminal 12d-ti is connected to a terminal 241 of the channel selector circuit do. Similar output terminals of the other size sorting channels .217-40 are connected to terminals 242-245 of the channel selector circuit ed. 
lll 
Terminals 241-245 are connected to inputs of an OR gate 245 the output of which is applied to a multivibrator 247 which is connected to all of the flip-ops 18d-190 of the ring counter. The multivibrator 247 generates a pulse of a certain relatively short duration, preferably on the order of microseconds, which advances the ring counter. 
 Accordingly, when the pulse generated by the first intercept of a first particle image in a iield is applied through the gate 1526 to the flip-nop 219 of the irst size sorting channel 36, the flip-dop 210 is operated to a set condition to develop a pulse in the differentiating circuit 239 which is applied through the OR gate 2416 to the multivibrator 247 which shifts the ring counter, whereupon the second tlip-op 187 thereof is set to enable the gate 197 with the other gates being closed. Upon the initial intercept of a second particle, a pulse is developed in like fashion in the second size sorting channel circuit 37 which is applied to terminal 242 of the channel selector circiut d6 and advances the ring counter to enable the third gate 19S with the remaining gates being closed. This sequence may be continued until all iive size sorting channeis are counting articles simultaneously. The blind gates of the circuits serve to prevent the counting of the same particle by more than one channel circuit. 
 As a particle is being measured by the size sorting channel 36, interrogation pulses (one for each scanning line that passes through the particle) leave the circuit 36 on the output terminal 225 and are applied to an input terminal of the size counter 41. Input terminal 250 is connected to the trigger input of the rst of ve hipflops 251-255 which form a binary counter. The set outputs of the flip-flops 251-255 are connected through emitter-followers 256 to ve lines Zei-265 which are connected through inverters 26e-27d to an additional five lines 271-275. Accordingly, there are ten lines, one pair for each of the tive binary stages of the counter defined by tiip-ops 251-255 and the state of the ten lines changes as the :count is accumulated. The lines 261-25 and 271- 275 are connected through ten OR gates 276 and ten emitter-followers 277 to a series of ten output terminals 281-290. 
 The gates 276 are normally closed except when a transfor command is generated in the circuit of the size sorting channel, shown in FIGURE 7. Referring thereto, when the scanning of a particular particle image has been completed as signified by an output from the interrogation gate 221, the flip-flop 21) is reset and an output therefrom triggers the delay multivibrator 235 which in turn triggers the read multivibrator 236. The output of the read multivibrator 235 is applied through the emitterfollower 237 to the output terminal 23S which is connected to input terminal 291 of the size counter circuit 41. The delay multivibrator 235 of the circuit 36 also triggers another delay multivibrator 292 which after a certain delay resets a iiip-ilop 293, previously set `by in focus pulses applied from the gate 233. The set output of the liip-iiop 293 is connected through an emitter-follower 294 to an output terminal 295 and the set output of the flip-flop 293 is high after a rst in focus pulse providing a high output on the output terminal 295 which lasts until after a read pulse on the output terminal 225. 
 Output terminal 295 of the circuit 36 is connected to an input terminal 296 of the counter circuit l1 to enable one leg of a three input gate 297. The read pulse applied to the input terminal 291 triggers a multivibrator 29S which generates a transfer gating pulse. This pulse is inverted and shaped by an amplifier inverter 299 and enables a second leg ofthe gate 297. The third leg of the gate 297 is enabled by the reset output of a flip-flop 350, the flip-lop 305 having been reset by a reset pulse applied from an input terminal 301 through an emitter-follower 302 to a reset line 303. 
 With gate 297 being so enabled, the transfer gating pulse is applied from the output thereof through an emitter-follower 304 to one leg of each of the ten gates 276 the other legs of which are connected to the lines 2671-265 and 271-275. For each of the gates 276 having a high level as determined by the count registered in the flip-hops 251-255, the transfer gate pulse is transmitted therethrough and through one of the emitter-followers 277 to an output terminal. Accordingly, pulses appear simultaneously on tive of the ten output terminals 231- 29d shortly after the conclusion of the counting of a particle. 
 The transfer gating pulse from the multivibrator 298 through the inverter 299 is applied through lan OR gate 395 and an inverter 307 to a multivibrator 308 connected to reset inputs of all of the flip-flops 251-255. The other input to the OR gate 306 is connected to a terminal 309 to which a common reset signal is applied. Thus a transfer pulse or a reset pulse, as the case may be, triggers the multivibrator 3tl8 to reset all of the flip-Hops 251-255. This signal is also applied through the emitter-follower 362 to the reset line 363 to reset the Hip-flop 300. 
 The time delays of these circuits are adjusted in a manner such that at the last interrogation pulse, the counter chain 251-255 is advanced, then the state or number stored therein is read out and then the flip-Hops of the counter chain are all reset to the initial zero count condition. 
 A fiip-op 31@ is provided in the size counter circuit 41 for the special cases of particles falling in the channel IX size range, i.e. when the number of lines traversing the particle is from 21 to 31. Two tive input AND gates 311 and 312 are provided. Gate 311 is connected to the binary lines 271, 262, 263, 274 and 265 in a manner such that it has an output only when the count stored in the chain 251-255 is equal to 22. Gate 312 is connected in the manner as illustrated such that it has an output only when the count is 31. If during the size counting operation, the count of 22 is reached, an output is then applied from the gate 311 to the Hip-flop 310 to operate the flip-nop 310 to its set condition. A signal is then applied through a gate 313 and an emitter-follower 314 to an output terminal 315. In a manner as described hereinbelow, this signal is used to advance the channel IX tally counter 65. However, if the size count reaches a count of 31, or the maximum counting capability, an output is developed from the gate 312 which is applied through an OR gate 31.6 to reset the flip-dop 310. The gate 313 is then closed and the particle would not be counted in channel IX. lf the operation should be continued beyond the count of 31, the counting chain 251-255 could be reset to start counting again from zero. To prevent this erroneous reading, the output from the gate 312 is also applied through an OR gate 317 to the flip-Hop 300, to operate the tiip-iiop 34m to its set condition and close the gate 297, thereby preventing the transfer operation. The OR gate 317 has a second input connected to the output of an AND gate 320 having one input connected to an input terminal 321 and a second input connected to the output of a multivibrator 322 having an input connected to an input terminal 323. Terminal 321 is connected to an output terminal 324, whereby the blind gate signal is applied thereto, while input terminal 323 is conectcd to a terminal of the matrix 56 in a manner such as to trigger the hip-flop 360 to its set condition and prevent transfer of a count in the event of no in focus pulses applied to terminal 296. 
 The output terminals 281-290 of the size counter 41 and like output terminals of the other size counters L52-45 are respectively connected to inputs of tive input OR gates 331-346 of the gating matrix 56 shown in FIGURE 9, the outputs of the gates 331-346 being connected through emitter-followers 341-350 to lines S51-360. Additional lines 361 and 362 are connected to suitable voltage sources, for example sources of plus 20 and minus 90 volts. 
The illustrated matrix 56 has fourteen output lines 363- 13 376 connected through resistors 377, resistors 378 and/ or diodes 379 to the lines 351-362 in the manner as illustrated in the drawing to produce output signals at the output terminals corresponding to the counts registered when a transfer pulse is applied. 
 Output lines 363-366, 37S and 376 are not used in the illustrated arrangement. Lines 367-374 are connected to the tally counters 57-65, respectively. A signal is developed on the output terminal 367 in response to a count of four, a signal on the output terminal 368 in response to a count of tive, a signal on the output terminal 369 in response to a count of six, a signal on the output terminal 370 in response to a counte of seven or eight, a signal on the output terminal 371 in response to a count of nine or ten, a signal on the output terminal 372 in response to a count of Ifrom eleven to thirteen, a signal on the output terminal 373 in response to a count of from fourteen to sixteen, and a signal on the output terminal 374 in response to a count oi seventeen to twenty-two. It will be appreciated of course that the arrangement of the diodes may be varied as desired in a particular application. 
 The circuit of the tally counter 57 is illustrated in FIGURE 10, it being understood that the other tally counters `58-65 have the same construction. The tally counter 57 comprises a series of ten binary Hip-flops 381- 390 which are reset by application of a reset signal to an input terminal 391 connected to the input of a multivibrator 392 having an output connected to reset inputs of the Hip-flops 381-390. A trigger input to the rst flipiiop 381 is connected to an input terminal 393 which is connected to the output terminal 367 of the gating matrix S. Each time a particle of a given size range is counted, in this case a particle through which four scanning lines pass, the counter is advanced by the count of one. With ten binary stages, the counting capability is 1,032. Outputs are taken from only the seven highest order binary stages 384-390. These stages are connected through emit-' ter-followers 394-400 and inverters 401-407 to inputs of seven transistor switches 408-414 which are used to connect a regulated voltage developed by a voltage regulator 415, preferably about 16 volts, to precision binary weighted resistors 416-422. The combined currents flowing through the resistors 416-422 are summed in two load resistors 423 and 424, each of which may preferably have a resistance of one ohm. With this arrangement, an analog voltage proportional to the registered binary count is developed. A meter 425 may be used to indicate the voltage, while an output terminal 426 is connected to the stepping switch 66 to be connected to the chart recorder 67. It may be noted that it is not necessary to read from all of the stages to achieve a high order of accuracy and by reading from only the highest seven binary stages 384- 390, there are a possible 128 states, given readout accuracy of better than 1%. 
 The seven output lines from the emitter-follower 394- 400 are connected to an AND gate 427, the output of which is applied through an emitter-follower 428 to an output terminal 429. This terminal may be connected to the terminal 381 to reset the counting chain and cause the counting operation to cease. The same is true on the channel II to channel VIII tally counters 58-64. On the channel IX tally counter 65, this output need not be used to stop the counting operation but instead it may set a flip-flop to cause an over-iiow lamp to be energized and to signify that a full count has -been reached in that channel. 
 It may be noted that with reference to FIGURE 3 showing the timing generator 68, the operation of the system may be stopped manually by operating a push button 430 to apply a signal through an OR ygate 431 to the reset input of iiip-op 99 or the system may be stopped automatically by application of a signal to an input terminal 432 connected through the OR gate 431 to the reset input of the nip-flop 99. Input terminal 432 may `be connected through a power drive 433 to the output terminal 73. 
 It will be understood that modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of this invention.
