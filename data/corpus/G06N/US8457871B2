SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
In embodiments of the present invention, a computer program product may identify a first location, at time one, of a plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate a cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then identify a second location, at time two, for each of the plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate the cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then calculate a vehicle speed for each of the plurality of automobiles using the first and second locations already identified. Once a vehicle speed is calculated for each of the plurality of automobiles, the computer program product may create a traffic condition measure for a route in proximity to the first and second locations. The computer program product may repeat this process in real-time to calculate a real-time traffic condition measure. Once the computer program product receives a signal from a cell phone tower indicating a user has entered a geographic location, the computer program product may provide the real-time traffic condition measure to the user's cell phone. The computer program product's response may be selected from a plurality of real-time traffic conditions measures based at least in part on traffic data relating to a geographic area in proximity to the user's geographic location. The computer program product's response can be calculated once the signal indicating the user has entered a geographic location is received or prior to receiving such a signal. The real-time traffic condition measure may be a traffic density measure that the computer program product may use to predict a travel time. The travel time prediction may be based at least in part on the measure of traffic density and at least one of the following: a time of day, a day of the week, a weather condition and/or a road condition corresponding to the real-time traffic condition measure.
In embodiments of the present invention, a computer program product may identify a first location, at time one, of a plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate a cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then identify a second location, at time two, for each of the plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate the cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then calculate a vehicle speed for each of the plurality of automobiles using the first and second locations already identified. Once a vehicle speed is calculated for each of the plurality of automobiles, the computer program product may create a traffic condition measure for a route in proximity to the first and second locations. The computer program product may repeat this process in real-time to calculate a real-time traffic condition measure. If the computer program product receives a request from a user's cell phone for traffic condition information associated with the route, the computer program product may respond by displaying the real-time traffic condition measure on the user's cell phone along with an advertisement associated with a destination in proximity to the route. The response may be created upon receipt of the user's request. In this case, the user's request may be manual or automated, which may be sent from the user's cell phone once a user enters a geographic location or region. The computer program product's response to a user's request may also come from a different user's prior manual or automated request for the same traffic information. In this case, a second user's automated request may be sent from the second user's cell phone upon the second user's cell phone entering a geographic location.
In embodiments of the present invention, a computer program product may identify a first location, at time one, of a plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate a cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then identify a second location, at time two, for each of the plurality of automobiles using cell phone tower triangulation to locate the cell phone within each of the plurality of automobiles. The computer program product may then calculate a vehicle speed for each of the plurality of automobiles using the first and second locations already identified. Once a vehicle speed is calculated for each of the plurality of automobiles, the computer program product may create a traffic condition measure for a route in proximity to the first and second locations. The computer program product may repeat this process in real-time to calculate a real-time traffic condition measure. If the computer program product receives a request from a user's cell phone for traffic condition information associated with the route, the computer program product may respond by displaying the real-time traffic condition measure on the user's cell phone along with product availability data from a store in proximity to the route. The computer program product's response may include product availability data from a plurality of store inventories in proximity to the route and/or include where such stores are located with the roadway presentation.

An aspect of the present invention is a user alert system. In an embodiment, a user loads a route to be taken and an automated system provides information to the user to give the user an update as to travel conditions for the route. For example, the route of Rt.95 south into NYC is loaded to be traveled, and or being traveled, on Wednesday. Congestion occurs (e.g. as a result of an accident or construction) in the route and the route information system sends a alert to the user. The alert may come in the form of calls, emails, text messages, voice messages, video messages or otherwise provides information to the user relating to the alert. The alert may be communicated to the users mobile communication facility (e.g. cell phone, mobile phone, satellite phone, internet phone, network phone, portable communication facility, wireless phone, pda, combination pda/mobile phone, PalmÂ® system, BlackberryÂ® system, in-vehicle communication facility, in-vehicle navigation facility, in-vehicle information facility), desktop computing facility, laptop computing facility, portable computing facility, client-server facility, local computing facility, networked based computing facility, internet appliance, internet computing facility or other such system useful in displaying and or interacting with such information. The alert may contain information to relating to identifying the accident and or congestion, time estimates for clearing the congestion, travel time estimates, alternate route information, alternate route suggestions, time estimates associated with alternate routes or other information related to the alert. In an embodiment, the alert system take the form of a call system that calls the user's mobile communication facility. In an embodiment, the user may use a web based routing system (e.g. mapquest.com) and load a mobile phone number into the web based routing system and the routing system may call the user with periodic updates as to the route conditions and or call the user with information relating to abnormal route conditions. In an embodiment, the call back system may suggest alternate routes and or predict the impact of abnormal conditions. For example, the call back system may call the user and inform the driver of a fifteen minute delay due to an accident and provide no alternate route or provide information indicating it is not worth seeking alternate routes. In an embodiment, the call back system may call the user with information relating to alternate routes. In embodiments, the user may preload route and or destination information, prior to or during travel, into a system and the user may be provided with information relating to the route and or destination prior to or during travel. For example, the user may be alerted through his mobile communication facility prior to leaving on the trip. For example, the user may have loaded a work destination into the system and the system may call him (email, or otherwise (e.g. an alert as described herein)) an hour prior to the trip to inform the user of travel conditions, alternate route suggestions or other information (e.g. route, direction, navigation information). The system may be programmed to send the alert, or update, only when problems, congestion, or other abnormalities occur, or the system may be programmed to provide information everyday, every workday, or periodically, or based on some other parameter.
 FIG. 29A illustrates systems and methods for communicating route information according to aspects of the present invention. In embodiments, a user may use a mobile communication facility (e.g. cell phone, mobile phone, satellite phone, internet phone, network phone, portable communication facility, wireless phone, pda, combination pda/mobile phone, PalmÂ® system, BlackberryÂ® system, in-vehicle communication facility, in-vehicle navigation facility, in-vehicle information facility) 2908 to access route, direction, navigation or other travel information.

In this embodiment, the user may have the option to choose a function (e.g. possibly from a menu) to start the recordation of the route and or route information 2914B. The user may also be presented with an option to end the recording 2914C. The user may also be presented with an option to name the recording 2914D.
 FIG. 29A illustrates a screen shot 2910C according to the principles of the present invention. Screen shot 2910C illustrates an embodiment where a user may set a time when he expects to start on a route or head to a destination. For example, a user may set the time he expects to start his travel through a menu style option 2918C and select a route and or destination through a menu 2918B or other facility (e.g. typing in the destination, calling a voice recognition system to load the destination, using voice recognition in the phone to load the destination, receiving the destination from an automated telephone answering system as described below in connection with the principles of the present invention). In an embodiment, the user may set the time to begin travel to a destination at some time before travel begins (e.g. the night before going to work) and an alert notification system as described herein in connection with the principles of the present invention (e.g. a voice mail, email, text message, video message or the like) may provide traffic alerts, route information, alternate route suggestions, alternate route information, or other information pertaining to the trip the traveler has planned. In an embodiment, the user may be presented with options to save times and routes as recurring. For example, the user may set the time he normally travels to and or from work along with his work destination and or route as a recurring to be provided with recurring route information, before during or following his trip. The recurring stored information may relate to work, home, periodic travel plans, school, activities or other destinations, routes, directions, navigation, or other route information. In an embodiment, the recurring alert system may be set to provide alerts continually, at set times, recurring at set times everyday, during week days, during weekends, if the route conditions are not typical, if it is typical, if there are problems expected, at a specified time before travel is expected, or otherwise.
 FIG. 29A illustrates a screen shot 2910D according to the principles of the present invention. Screen shot 2910D illustrates an embodiment where a user may display information pertaining to route performance, direction, navigation or other information relating to travel. In this embodiment, the screen shot contains a graph of route performance similar to that described in connection with FIGS. 27-29.
 FIG. 29A illustrates a screen shot 2910E according to the principles of the present invention. Screen shot 2910E illustrates an embodiment where a user may select a link, button, menu selection, or other connection 2920A to obtain route and or navigation information. For example, the connection 2920A may be selected to check traffic on a given route and or the route the user is currently traveling. The user may be sitting in traffic and want to know how long the delay will be, what is causing the delay, alternative route information, number of miles until the congestion breaks up, or other information relating to the route. In another situation, the user may be moving along the route at expected speeds and want an update as to the route performance ahead, traffic ahead, alternative route, expected delays, or other information. In an embodiment, the phone may connect with a route information service upon selection of the connection 2920A. The route information service may already have the route information for the route or road the travel has chosen to check or the road the traveler is on. In another embodiment, the route information service may gather the information upon the request. For example, the route information service may monitor the traffic on main roads and highways in a real time or near real time manner, but the service may not track performance of smaller, less traveled, secondary or other roads or areas. Upon request, the route information service may âpingâ cell phones or other transmitters in the area of the user to assess the traffic condition and then report back to the user. In an embodiment, the service may provide updates on a periodic basis.
In embodiments, a data collection facility may be incorporated into a, or associated with a, mobile communication facility. The data collection facility may be adapted to collect information pertaining to the user's habits and apply the data collected through algorithms to help determine future performance. For example, the collection facility may collect information on the user's travel habits (e.g. how fast he typically drives as compared to speed limits and or other traffic) and this information may be used in the prediction or estimates of future travel times. For example, when predicting the travel time based on the time of day, or other parameter, the fact that the user normally exceeds speed limits by five to ten miles per hour may be factored into the travel estimate (e.g. applied to the sections of travel where light traffic is expected).
An aspect of the present invention relates to warning of traffic conditions. In an embodiment, a traffic tracking facility may be used to generate a warning signal and the warning signal may be transmitted to a vehicle in close proximity to a traffic condition. For example, a tracking facility may track traffic patterns and locate an abnormal traffic condition (e.g. an accident, construction, traffic congestion, or vehicles traveling a significantly slower rates than a speed limit or predicted speed) and a warning facility may be used to warn vehicles in close proximity to the abnormal traffic condition.
 FIG. 30 illustrates warning through an on-dash signal 3002 according to the principles of the present invention. In an embodiment, a driver may be warned of a traffic condition through the on-dash signal 3002. The on-dash placement of the signal is one example of a useful placement of a visual warning facility, the present invention encompasses other types and placements of visual warning facilities as well as audio facilities and warning through physical contact methods (e.g. vibration). For example, an external signal may be received by the warning facility in the vehicle and the external signal may provide warning information to alert the driver. In an embodiment, a traffic tracking system may monitor the traffic conditions in an area and the tracking system may generate warning signals to vehicles in close proximity to a particular traffic condition. For example, the tracking system may detect an unusual traffic condition indicating abnormally slow traffic in close proximity with traffic that is moving at significantly higher speeds. The tracking position system may ascertain information relating to the traffic in the higher speed portion (e.g. through cell phone identification, through on-board vehicle identification, through gps identification) and communicate to the vehicles in the higher speed traffic portion information indicating the abnormal traffic condition.
 FIG. 31 illustrates warning facility 3102 through on board mapping system 302 according to the principles of the present invention. In an embodiment, the on board mapping system 302 may display a warning indication 3102 to provide a driver with information pertaining to traffic conditions. For example, the on board mapping system may receive information relating to slower traffic in the planned route or route currently traveling, and the mapping system may generate an indication on the map 100 indicating the slower traffic. In an embodiment, an audio warning may accompany a display indication.
 FIG. 32 illustrates a process for warning of traffic conditions based on cell phone locations 3200 according to the principles of the present invention.

 FIG. 35 illustrates a system and method for communicating from a vehicle with transmitter to a vehicle with a receiver according to the principles of the present invention 3500. In an embodiment, a first vehicle 3502A includes a transmitter 3504 and a second vehicle 3502B includes a receiver 3510. In an embodiment, the first vehicle 3502A may transmit information relating to its performance (e.g. speed, acceleration, deceleration, braking, temperature) to the second vehicle 3502B. For example, the transmission range of the transmitter 3504 may be short range (e.g. 100 yards) and the first vehicle may generate and communicate information relating to its speed or rate of change in speed through its transmitter 3504. A vehicle within the transmitter range, for example the second vehicle 3502B, may receive the information. In and embodiment, the second vehicle 3502B may automatically respond to the information (e.g. by decelerating if the indication is the first vehicle 3502A is decelerating) or a warning facility in the second vehicle 3502B may generate and communicate a warning or other indication to the driver of the second vehicle 3502B. In an embodiment, the transmitter 3504 may have a long range (e.g. one mile). The transmitter 3504 may transmit information relating to the performance of the vehicle and vehicles within the transmission range may receive the information. For example, the speed of the first vehicle 3502A may be abnormally slow, or significantly slower than the speed of a following second vehicle 3502B. The second vehicle may include a warning facility and the warning facility may generate a warning for the driver of the second vehicle of slower up coming traffic. A method of communicating information over a relatively long range may be useful to warn up coming traffic of abnormal traffic conditions such as an accident, construction, or other congestion. In an embodiment, construction equipment (e.g. machines, trucks, barriers, signs) are equipped with such transmitters to warn of construction activity.
 FIG. 36 illustrates a vehicle with transponder according to the principles of the present invention 3600. In an embodiment, a vehicle 3502 may include a transponder 3602 that may be activated by another vehicle in close proximity.

In an embodiment, the process involves transmitting an indication of a vehicle condition from a first vehicle 3702, receiving the indication at a second vehicle 3704, and communicating a warning in the second vehicle 3708.
 FIG. 38 illustrates a process flow diagram for maintaining vehicle speed based on received information 3800 according to the principles of the present invention. In an embodiment, the process involves transmitting an indication of a vehicle speed from a first vehicle 3802, receiving the indication at a second vehicle 3804, and controlling and or modifying the speed of the second vehicle based on the indication 3808.
An aspect of the present invention relates to systems and methods of providing route information, navigation, and or directions. In embodiments, a traveler may use a mobile communication facility, cell phone, or other communication facility to connect with a route information system. The route information system may locate the traveler through a location facility in coordination with route or mapping information. The traveler may request information relating to routes and or directions from the route information facility, for example through cell phone interaction. The traveler may request information relating to a preloaded route for example. In embodiments, the route information system may automatically provide route information pertaining to the apparent route the traveler is on. The traveler may be provided with an opportunity to select route options or alternatives. In an embodiment, the traveler may activate the route information facility through use of a cell phone. Similar to the cell phone activated 411 telephone information system (where phone number information is provided), the traveler may dial an access code (e.g. 411, 511, *71, etc.) to be connected with the system. Once connected, the traveler may request direction and or route information relating to a destination. For example, he may request directions to the âYMCA in Danvers, Mass.â. The route information system may then look up, or be used to look up, the destination address, locate the traveler (e.g. through cell phone triangulation), and provide the traveler directions to the destination. In embodiments, the traveler may request directions to a type of destination (e.g. gas station, hotel, ATM) or landmark (e.g. State House) or activity (e.g. arcade).
 FIG. 39 illustrates a travel information system 3900 according to the principles of the present invention. As described herein in connection with FIG. 7, a cellular tower system may be associated with a location facility 3902. The location facility 3902 may provide location, speed, or other information relating to a transmitter (e.g. cell phone). The travel information system 3900 may also include a route information facility 3904. The route information facility 3904 may be associated with a destination database 3912, a route database 3914 and a traffic information database 3918. In an embodiment, the destination database 3912 may include information relating to destination locations. For example, it may be a database with associations between phone numbers, street addresses, towns, states, countries, type of destination, type of landmark, type of activity or other information relating to destinations. The destination database may also include information relating to preloaded destination(s). For example, a traveler may load information relating to a destination to be later retrieved.
In an embodiment, the route information database 3914 may include information relating to travel routes. For example, it may include maps, map information, traffic information, travel condition information, travel times, travel time predictions, or other information regarding to routes, navigation, and or directions. In an embodiment, the traffic information database 3918 may include information relating to route traffic, alternate routes, route times, route time predictions, typical route performance or other information relating to routes and or directions.
While the destination database 3912, route database 3914, and traffic information databases are illustrated as separate databases, it should be understood that these and other databases may be combined or further separated, and associations may be made between the data in the databases.
The route information facility 3904 may use information in the databases (e.g. databases 3912, 3914, 3918) as well as information from the location facility 3902 to provide information to the traveler. In embodiments, a traveler connects with the route information facility 3904 through a cell phone, or other communication facility, transmission 3910. For example, the traveler may initiate a connection by dialing an access code (e.g. 411 or *73). Once connected, the route information facility 3904 may gather information from the location facility 3902 or databases 3912, 3914, and 3918 to provide information to the traveler.
In an embodiment, route information may be preloaded into a route information facility 3904, or associated facility or database, and the route information facility 3904 may provide traffic information pertaining to the route given a travelers location. For example, a traveler may dial a specific phone number or code (e.g. *73) on his cell phone to access the route information facility 3904. The route information facility 3904 may then locate the traveler's position (e.g. using cell phone triangulation, or gps location) and associate the position with the preloaded route information. The traveler may then be provided with route specific travel conditions (e.g. congestion, travel time estimates or predictions).
In an embodiment, the traveler may also be informed about alternate routes or alternate route performance. For example, the traveler may be traveling on I-93S towards Boston when initiating the call. The route information facility 3904 may recognize his position as being close to the Sullivan Square exit. The traffic conditions on the highway to downtown may be such that taking the Sullivan Square exit and corresponding alternative route to downtown may cut time off the traveler's trip. The traveler may be informed of the route performance, comparison of times estimated, predicted times, or the like.
In an embodiment, the traveler may take the alternate route and make an indication (e.g. key stroke) telling the route information facility 3904 of his decision. In an embodiment, the traveler stays engaged with the route information facility 3904, the system monitors his position and recognizes the new route. The route information facility 3904 may then communicate new route instructions. The new route instructions may be provided as complete instructions, stepwise, or otherwise.
In an embodiment, a route information facility 3904 identifies a traveler's position (e.g. through cell phone triangulation), associates the position with a roadway, and predicts the route the traveler is taking For example, the traveler may initiate a call to the route information facility 3904 while traveling on I-93S towards Boston. The route information facility 3904 may recognize the traveler's position, associate a roadway with the traveler's position and predict he is traveling I-93S to Boston or some destination before or after Boston. In an embodiment, traveler would then be informed of traffic conditions on I-93S ahead of the traveler. For example, the traveler may be informed of traffic conditions up to and or through Boston.
In an embodiment, a traveler may select route options to instruct the route information facility 3904 of the travelers route intentions. For example, the route information facility 3904 may identify the traveler as traveling on I-93S towards Boston (e.g. through cell phone triangulation) and provide route options to the traveler to select a route other than continuing on I-93S towards Boston. The options may be menu driven (e.g. select one for I-495S, two for I-495N), exit driven (e.g. type in your exit number), or otherwise driven for indicating a desired or intended route (e.g. voice recognition indications). In an embodiment, the traveler may be provided information relating to the selected route.
In an embodiment, a traveler may load route and or destination information into a route information facility 3904 and later activate a direction system through his mobile communicator (e.g. cell phone, on-board transmitter). For example, the traveler may load destination and or route information into a computing system via the internet or other means. The traveler may then connect with the route information facility 3904 to obtain directions. The monitoring system may locate the traveler through triangulation or other means and provide directions per the preloaded route information and or preloaded destination information. The information may be provided in a stepwise, complete or other fashion.
In an embodiment, voice recognition software may be employed to provide the traveler with a convenient way of loading route and or destination information. For example, a traveler may be on the road and call into a monitoring system to load a destination facilitated by voice activation. The destination may include a street address, phone number or other indication of the destination. In an embodiment, the traveler may use a phone keyboard to load the phone number of the desired destination. The monitoring system may then look up the corresponding address to provide route and or destination information. Once the route and or destination information are loaded, the traveler may connect with the monitoring system for directions, time estimations, traffic conditions or other information.
In an embodiment, a traveler may request directions to a type of destination (e.g. gas station, coffee shop, Dunkin Donuts, Star Bucks, shopping center, Hotel) to a monitoring system. The system may locate the traveler and provide directions to the destination chosen. For example, the system may accept voice commands to identify the destination type. The voice commands may direct a menu and or be recognized as types of destinations. In another example, keys of a phone may be used to select types of destinations from a menu.
In an embodiment, a user may call into a information system, identify a destination, and provided directions or other route information. For example, the user may use a cell phone to call an information system (e.g. 411), identify a business or residence along with approximate location (e.g. state and town), and then be provided directions to the specific location. In an embodiment, the directions may be provided from the user's cell phones location. For example, a traveler may be traveling to the YMCA in Danvers, Mass. and require assistance in getting to the location. The traveler may use his cell phone to call âinformationâ asking for directions to the YMCA in Danvers, Mass. The system may be used to look up the street address of the YMCA, identify the travelers location (e.g. through cell phone triangulation or gps) and provide directions from the travelers present location to the YMCA destination. In an embodiment, the directions may be provided in total so the traveler can disconnect from the system. In an embodiment, the directions may be provided in stepwise fashion, guiding each sep of the traveler's route (e.g. âtake next right at Main St.â). In an embodiment, the direction instructions may be altered to accommodate unforeseen obstacles (e.g. the traveler misses a turn, encounters construction, or detours).
While many of the embodiments illustrate direct communication with the route information facility (e.g. cell phone communication to the route information facility) embodiments may include communication through other facilities. For example, the cell phone communication may occur through the location facility and the location facility may be associated with the route information facility. There are many such variations envisioned by the inventors and such variations are included in various embodiments.
In embodiments, the route information facility may be associated with a route prediction facility. A route prediction facility may be a facility used to predict route performance based on current and or past route and or associated route performance.
 FIG. 40 illustrates a portable communication facility 4000 according to the principles of the present invention. In embodiments, a portable communication facility 4000 may be a cell phone, mobile phone, walkie talkie, satellite phone, pda, web device, Blackberry device, email device, web browsing facility, in-vehicle communication facility, in-vehicle navigation facility, in-vehicle information facility or other facility used for mobile and or portable communication. In embodiments, the portable communication facility may include a display facility 4006, a keyboard 4008 (e.g. numbered key on a phone, or alpha-numeric keys of a pda), and an antenna 4002 to facilitate communications with other facilities using wireless communication techniques.
In embodiments, a portable communication facility 4000 may be used to communicate with a route information facility 3904. For example, a cell phone may be used in one or two-way communication with the route information facility 3904. An example of two-way communication may be when the cell phone is used to connect with the route information facility and facilitate communication of a query (e.g. dialing 411 and requesting information pertaining to a location) and the phone is also be used to receive information pertaining to the query. For example, the route information facility may communicate directions to a location from a present location of the traveler through audio communication (e.g. directions the traveler can listen to on his cell phone). The route information system may also communicate directions, or other route information, through display signals. For example, the directions 4010 information may be communicated to be displayed on the display facility 4006 of the cell phone or pda or other facility. This way the traveler has a visual indication of the directions.
In embodiments, the cell phone, or other portable communication facility, may be used in one-way communications, either sending or receiving. For example, the cell phone may be used to facilitate an initial query (e.g. get me directions to the location) but the directions may be sent to another facility. For example, a vehicle may be equipped with a travel information system, LCD screen, or other facility with a display facility and the direction information may be sent to the vehicles display. In an embodiment, an association between a users cell phone and vehicle system may be made to facilitate communications to the vehicle following a cell phone initiated communication. In an embodiment, the receiving facility may be another portable communication facility (e.g. pda). Again, an association may be made between portable communication facilities to facilitate the directions of the communications.
In an embodiment, a traveler may request directions or other route information from a route information facility without the assistance of an automatic location facility. For example, a traveler may connect to the route information facility via a portable communication facility (e.g. a cell phone) and request directions or route information from a location the traveler identifies to the route information facility. For example, the traveler may know his location (e.g. corner of Main St. and Elm St., in Danvers, Mass.) and instruct the route information facility of his present location along with his desired destination. In embodiments, the traveler may speak this information, write, type, key or other communicate the information. In embodiments, the route information facility may receive the information via human interaction, automatically or semi-automatically. For example, a human may receive the information, or a voice recognition facility may be used. The route information facility may be manual, automatic or semi-automatic itself in an embodiment. For example, it may receive information through human interaction, the person may look up travel, route, or direction information on a computer facility (e.g. www.mapquest.com) for directions per the given location and destination, and the person may communicate the information back to the traveler.
 FIG. 41 illustrates an in-vehicle communication facility 4102 according to the principles of the present invention. In embodiments, the in-vehicle communication facility 4102 is mounted on or in the vehicle, 4100. The in-vehicle communication facility 4102 may include a display facility 4104 where route information and or directions may be displayed. The in-vehicle communication facility 4104 may also include a user interface 4108. For example, the user interface 4108 may be used to initiate contact with a location facility and or a route information facility.

An aspect of the present invention relates to systems and methods used to communicate information from a telephone answering facility. In embodiments, information from a telephone answering facility is communicated (e.g. as a result of a user prompt or call) through digital data that can be received and viewed as text, image, and or other visual content through the use of a communication platform (e.g. a mobile communication facility, a cell phone, pda, BlackBerryÂ®, PalmPilotÂ®, remote communication facility, landline communication facility, wireless communication facility, in-vehicle communication facility, in-vehicle navigation facility, in-vehicle information facility, or desktop communication facility.). In embodiments, the information may contain and be formatted to be received and retrievable through an audio reproduction facility (e.g. a cell phone). For example, a user may use a cell phone to call an answering facility to request information. Information may then be communicated by the answering facility to the cell phone. The information received by the cell phone may include text, image and or sound information. The information may then be stored in the cell phone, or in another associated facility (e.g. remote memory location accessible by the cell phone). The user of the cell phone may than be able to retrieve the information and read the text, view the image, and listen to the audio information provided.
In embodiments, the information communicated from the telephone answering facility to the communication platform may include information pertaining to a business, retailer, residence, home, or other establishment associated with the telephone answering facility. For example, the information may include information pertaining to the location of a store, directions to a location, sale information, coupon information, hours of operation, inventory, item selection, movie times, cost information or other desired information. For example, a user may call a store to get directions and an answering facility may respond (e.g. automatically or through a user prompt) by sending information to the user's cell phone for user viewing. The user can then view the information and or store the information for later viewing. The user may open a message or file to retrieve the information. In embodiments, directions provided may be generic directions (e.g. from a known landmark, roadway or highway), user location specific directions (e.g. based on the triangulation or gps coordinates of the cell phone), navigation, user specific directions based on typical route conditions, based on current route conditions, based on the telephone answering facilities desired route conditions (e.g. to avoid sending the user on routes that include certain competitors or other undesirable or desirable landmarks), and or based on other relevant information. In embodiments, the information includes links to webpages and or other information pages. In embodiments, the information includes forms, selectors, or other areas where user provided information can be loaded and or selected in order to be communicated back to the telephone answering facility or other facility. For example, a user may call the theater and the answering facility may respond by sending information to the users cell phone. The information may include information pertaining to currently running shows. The user may view and or listen to the stored information and decide to purchase tickets for this evening's show. The user then makes the appropriate selection on his cell phone and transmits his ticket request back to the answering facility or to another facility he is directed to. In response, the user may receive information pertaining to his ticket purchase on his cell phone or at another facility.
 FIG. 42 illustrates a system for communicating with a telephone answering facility 4202 wherein information 4210 is communicated in a format to be viewed and or listened to through the communication platform 4204 (e.g. a cell phone) according to the principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, a user may use the communication platform 4204 to call or otherwise initiate or establish communication with the telephone answering facility 4202. The telephone answering facility 4202 may communicate information to the user through real-time voice communication. The real-time voice communication may include the presentation of menu options (e.g âsay or press one for store information) or through an automated information response (e.g. provided information without prompt). For example, the answering facility may respond to the call with a menu indicating the user should press one in order to receive an information download to his cell phone or other communication facility. The user may then communicate the selection of the digit one 4208 to the telephone answering facility 4202. The telephone answering facility 4202 may then communicate information to be received and stored on the cell phone or other facility 4210. This communication may be take place while the user continues on the voice call or at some time following the call. The communication 4210 from the answering facility may be in a form to be received and viewed on the cell phone. For example, it may be a text message, a short message, an email message, a webpost message or other format intended to be viewed through a viewing facility. The information 4210 may also include images (e.g. a .jpeg file), pictures, video, or other image information. The information 4210 may also include audio information (e.g. an mp3 file). In embodiments, the audio information may be associated with the text and or image information provided.
In embodiments, once the information 4210 is received by the cell phone 4204, the information may be stored in the cell phone for later retrieval. For example, the information may be stored and associated with the address book or other list in the phone. The information may pertain to a store (e.g. a bike store, grocery store) and the user may store the information in a file associated with the cell phone contact list. When the user wants information pertaining to the bike store, he calls it up through the name associated in the contacts list. He may then be able to view all or a portion of the information associated with the name listed in the contact list.
In embodiments, the information stored on the cell phone may also include a feature for updating the information. For example, the information may include an âupdateâ button (e.g. a software generated icon) and the user may update the information through a click or otherwise activate the update button. Once activated, the phone may initiate communication with the original answering facility or other update facility to retrieve update information. In embodiments, the information provided may include direction information and the directions may be provided from the cell phones location (e.g. through gps coordinates and map comparison). The user may choose to update the information based on his new location. For example, the user may want to receive written or audio directions to a store or other location, so he calls the answering facility and downloads direction information based on his present location (e.g. based on his cell phone location). Once he is underway, he may review the downloaded information. If he gets lost, runs into traffic or otherwise wants updated information he may select an update feature or call the answering facility again to receive updated directions from his new location.
In an embodiment, the information may contain sale or coupon information and the user may choose to get updated information pertaining to sales or new coupons from time to time.
In an embodiment, the telephone answering facility may retain information pertaining to what devices or what persons it has delivered information to and the telephone answering facility or other update facility may communicate updated information to the previously contacted devices with updated information. In embodiments, this update procedure may occur automatically, at predetermined time(s), when information is updated, when there is new sale or coupon information, or at other times determined by either the operators of the answering facility or the user. For example, the telephone answering facility may automatically (e.g. non-caller prompted) communicate updated sale, coupon, direction, phone number or other information to a cell phone that was once used to collect information. In an embodiment, the information may be delivered without notification to the cell phone user. In an embodiment, the information may be delivered along with an alert to the user that new sale information has been loaded. In an embodiment, the new information may be displayed on the screen of the users communication facility and or stored in the facility for later viewing. By way of example, information pertaining to a sale may be communicated to a users cell phone. Information pertaining to the sale may be displayed, in either summary form or in its entirety, on the cell phone display. The information may also be stored on the cell phone and associated with the information or replace the information already in the cell phone. The information displayed on the screen may also include a link to further information stored on the cell phone or information stored in a remote location. For example, the information may contain a hyper link to the store's website or to a file on the cell phone.

In this embodiment, a user uses his cell phone, or other communication platform 4204, to communicate through the cell phone network 4302 to an answering facility associated with the bike store 4304. The ownership of the bike store would like to provide location and direction information to the user, so the answering facility is configured to communicate location and direction information to the users cell phone. The information is formatted to be received and stored and or viewed by the user through the cell phone. In an embodiment, the location and direction information may be provided in a generic form. For example, the location and direction information may include an address, phone number and directions from a local landmark, roadway or highway (e.g. âwhen coming from Boston . . . â or âwhen coming from the north . . . â or âwhen coming from Route 95 . . . â). In an embodiment, the location and direction information may be provided from a specific location. For example, the location of the cell phone may be determined through a location-based service 4402 (e.g. gps location service, or cell phone triangulation location service) and the directions from the cell phones present location may be determined and provided through a text message or the like. The text message may read like a set of instructions from the users present location. For example, âgo straight on Elm St for 1.8 miles, turn right on Main St. for 0.4 miles, take Route 95 north to Exit 38 . . . â The user may store these directions and call them up to read while in transit. In an embodiment, the cell phone is equipped with an audio system adapted to read the directions back in either complete or stepwise fashion. In an embodiment, the direction page, or associated page, may be equipped with an update facility wherein the user can update the directions. For example, the user may now be in a location in-route, be lost, or coming from another location and want updated information. The user could call the answering facility for updated directions, or activate the update facility to automatically update the directions from the users present location.
In an embodiment, the location and direction information may be provided from a user specified location. For example, the user may type, speak, or otherwise load a starting location (e.g. 11 Market St., Frenchtown, Mich.) into the system and the telephone answering facility may send directions based on the loaded location.
In embodiments, the directions communicated to the cell phone 4204 in coordination with the location based service 4402 are provided in such a way as to provide real-time directions.

 FIG. 56 illustrates a process for providing secure location information transactions 5500 through the use of an automatic filter 5602 for unwanted requests (e.g. a spam filter). In embodiments, the spam filter may examine the headers and or content of the request, and look for various features. Each feature may be associated with a score (which may be negative). The scores of all the features found may be totalled, and a higher total score may indicate that the message is more likely to be spam and as a result not allowed to pass and or the filter may be used to prevent location information from being communicated to the requestor. In an embodiment a request with a total score over some predetermined amount (e.g. 5) is filtered, and possibly logged or used to provide notification. In embodiments, the user may adjust this predetermined amount higher, to let in more location requests and block fewer legitimate location requests, or lower, to block more spam and risk blocking more legitimate location requests. In embodiments, a user may change the âspam score thresholdâ on his mobile communication facility, on a related facility, through an associated website facilitating spam filter settings, or the like. In embodiments the spam filter may use location request origin, the software used to send the request, what the request looks like, messages within the request, terms within the request, or other information related to the request as an indication of spam content. In embodiments, if the spam filter passes the request as legitimate, location information may be provided (e.g. from the gps location facility in a mobile communication facility) 5510. In embodiments, if the spam filter does not pass the request as legitimate, a notification may be sent to the user, and or the request may be logged 5508.

There are many techniques envisioned and encompassed by the present invention relating to providing location information to known users or users with approved access. Embodiments involve receiving location information requests through the use of passwords, digital signatures, private keys, public/private keys and or other techniques useful in identifying the source of the request and or identifying the approval level of the request/requestor.
Embodiments involve encrypting the request and or the location information being requested. For example, a cryptographic system that uses two keysâa public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the request. In embodiments, the private key may be used to accept the in-bound request and or be provided with the requested location information. For example, a location service may request the location of a mobile communication facility and the request may be accompanied by key information 5702. The key information may have been previously obtained from the user of the mobile communication facility or otherwise obtained authorized key information. Once the location information is received by the mobile communication facility along with the key information, the mobile communication facility may compare the received key information with the user's key information 5704. If they match, or otherwise indicate authorized access, the location information associated with the mobile communication facility may be provided to the service requesting the location information 5510. In the event the location request does not come with key information or appropriate key information, the location information may not be sent. The unauthorized request may also be logged and or a notification of the request may be communicated to the user of the mobile communication facility 5508. In embodiments, the key compare may be done through a facility other than the mobile communication facility. For example, the location information request may be communicated through another computing facility where the compare is completed. Once completed, an approved request may be communicated to the mobile communication facility.
 FIG. 58 illustrates an embodiment involving user approval prior to providing location information from the user's mobile communication facility. For example, an external facility may request location information from the mobile communication facility 5802. The user may then be notified of the request 5804. The user may then review the information request, requestor information, or other information relating to the request to decide if he wants to provide the location information. The user may then interact with a user interface, on the mobile communication facility for example, to either permit or not permit the information to be communicated 5808. If he accepts the request, the information may be provided 5510. If he denies the request, the information may not be provided and the request may be logged and or other notifications may be provided.
