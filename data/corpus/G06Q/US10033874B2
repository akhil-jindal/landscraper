BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Technical Field
The present invention relates to control networks, more specifically to control networks leveraging radio frequency communication standards, such as near field communication standards and Bluetooth Low Energy standards, for initiating conference calls.
Background Art
Company personnel are increasingly using audio and video conferencing systems for daily communication. In corporate settings today, conference rooms are equipped with high quality audiovisual devices to enable audio or video conference calls. Dialing these calls can prove to be a frustrating experience where a user must enter a long string of numbers or letters into the system, such as an audio conference bridge number and passcode, a lengthy Internet Protocol (IP) address, or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Typically, a user opens a calendar invitation or an electronic mail to look up the dialing information and manually types that information into a phone or a conference system.
Some systems provide address books stored on the conference endpoint equipment to simplify the dialing instructions. The address books store conferencing information, such as phone numbers, IP addresses, and network communication protocols. In companies with hundreds or thousands of employees that regularly conduct conference calls, such address books may be difficult to navigate in order to locate the desired conference call to dial. Also, since address books must be pre-populated with dialing information, they cannot be used to call users not listed in the address books. Other systems look at a room calendar to determine how to dial the call. However, these systems require the user to book the room ahead of time in order for the information to get to the equipment. As such, users desire a less burdensome system and method for dialing conference calls.
As portable electronic devices became readily available, corporate personnel are issued corporate portable electronic devices through which they can be readily accessible. The portable electronic devices are generally equipped with a calendar application for scheduling meetings, including conference calls. At the approach of a scheduled conference call, the calendar application prompts the user of the upcoming conference call and allows the user to dial the conference call using the portable electronic device directly from the scheduled meeting notice. Yet, there is no convenient way for the user to dial the conference call using the high quality audiovisual conferencing equipment installed in a conference room. As such, users desire a one-touch solution for dialing conference calls via the conferencing equipment installed in a conference room.
The ever-expanding reach of smart portable devices has recently extended to building automation. Smart phones and tablets are increasingly providing convenient and varied control options for residential and commercial buildings. While the introduction of smart portable devices to home automation has had a noticeable positive impact, existing systems do not fully leverage the capabilities of current generation smart phones and tablets. One such capability is short range communication technologies such as near field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth.
NFC is a set of standards for short-range wireless communication technology that employs magnetic field induction to enable communication between electronic devices in close proximity. The technology allows an NFC-enabled device to communicate with another NFC-enabled device or to retrieve information from an NFC tag. This enables users to perform intuitive, safe, contactless transactions, access digital content and connect electronic devices simply by touching or bringing devices into close proximity.
NFC operates in the standard unlicensed 13.56 MHz frequency band over a range of around 2-4 cm and offers data rates in the range of at least 106 kbits/s to 424 kbit/s. NFC standards cover communication protocols and data exchange formats and are based on existing radio frequency identification (RFID) standards. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC Forum, a non-profit industry organization which promotes NFC and certifies device compliance. There are two modes of operation covered by the NFC standards: active and passive. In active mode, both communicating devices are capable of transmitting data. Each device alternately generates and deactivates their own electromagnetic field to transmit and receive data. In passive mode, only one device, the initiator devices, generates an electromagnetic field, while the target device, typically an NFC tag, modulates the electromagnetic field to transfer data. The NFC protocol specifies that the initiating device is responsible for generating the electromagnetic field. In this mode, the target device may draw its operating power from the initiator-provided electromagnetic field.
Bluetooth is a set of specifications for common short range wireless applications. They are written, tested & maintained by the Bluetooth SIG. The Bluetooth Low Energy technology was introduced in the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0, enabling devices that can operate for months or even years on coin-cell batteries.
Bluetooth Low Energy operates in the same spectrum range (2402-2480 MHz) as the âclassicâ Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of Bluetooth technology's seventy-nine 1 MHz wide channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has forty 2 MHz wide channels. Additionally, Bluetooth Low Energy technology uses a different frequency hopping scheme than prior Bluetooth technology. These improvements make Bluetooth Low Energy ideally suited for discrete data transfer as opposed to streaming as in previous Bluetooth technologies.
There is now a need to fully leverage the short range communication capabilities of smart portable devices, such as smart phones and tablets, to provide more robust conferencing systems. Accordingly, a need has arisen for systems, methods, and modes that provide quick and simple pairing of user's portable electronic devices with a meeting room conferencing system and providing users with a one-touch solution to dial a conference call through the meeting room conferencing equipment via their portable electronic devices.

Accordingly, the systems, methods, and modes of the aspects of the embodiments described herein can be manufactured by Crestron Electronics, Inc., located in Rockleigh, N.J.
The present invention provides a system for leveraging short range communication technologies such as near field communications and Bluetooth 4.0 to manage the schedule of one or more areas in a facility, such as conference rooms in a corporate facility. A portable electronic device, such as a smart phone, communicates with an identification unit, such as NFC tag or one or more RF beacons, located in or near a conference room. The portable electronic device may read an application identifier and a room address or area address from the identification unit. The room address may be a uniform resource locator (URL) for a scheduling server. The application identifier identifies a scheduling application to open on the portable electronic device. The scheduling application then employs the URL to communicate with the scheduling server. Upon accessing the scheduling server, the user may manage the conference room schedule by viewing the schedule for the conference room, reserving the conference room for a period of time, reserving resources, preconfiguring room and resource settings, starting a meeting, ending a meeting, sharing documentation and viewing resources for the conference room among other things.
While the current invention is described as being implemented for managing the schedule of one or more conference rooms in a commercial facility it is not limited to such an implementation. The present invention may be employed to reserve any area or asset in which a common schedule is maintained. For example, one or more assets or areas in a commercial, residential, retail, or non-profit structure. For example, the present invention may be used to manage the schedule of a workstation for a hoteling employee.
Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary embodiment of a system 100 for managing a conference room schedule is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that the exemplary embodiment of system 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 may be varied in one or more aspects without departing from the spirit and scope of the teachings disclosed herein.
The system 100 includes a portable electronic device 13. The portable electronic device 13 may be a smart phone, tablet, remote control, personal digital assistant or any other electronic device configured for storing a scheduling application 20 and communicating with other electronic devices via RF communication protocols. As will be further explained below, the portable electronic device 13 is configured to receive information via the identification unit, such as an NFC tag 11, communicate with a scheduling server 15 and send at least one command 103 to control preset resources 105 once a conference room 101 with the preset resources 105 is reserved.
The portable electronic device 13 is associated with a user ID. The user ID may be a characteristic of the device itself or assigned to the device, such as a manufacturer ID or a network address, which is associated with a user. Alternatively, the user ID may be an ID associated with an account of the user. For example, the user may register a user ID with a scheduling application on the portable electronic device.
For example, the portable electronic device 13 may be a smart phone running a scheduling application 20 available from Crestron Electronics, Inc. The scheduling application 20 may be downloaded and stored in the portable electronic device 13 from an application marketplace such as the Google Play marketplace, the iTunesÂ® application marketplace or other similar marketplace.
 FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting the portable electronic device 13, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. The portable electronic device 13 may include at least one central processing unit (CPU) 131. For example, the CPU 131 may represent one or more microprocessors, and the microprocessors may be âgeneral purposeâ microprocessors, a combination of general and special purpose microprocessors, or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Additionally or alternatively, the CPU 131 may include one or more reduced instruction set (RISC) processors, video processors, or related chip sets. The CPU 131 may provide processing capability to execute an operating system, run various applications, and/or provide processing for one or more of the techniques described herein. Applications that may run on the portable electronic device 13 may include, for example software for managing a calendar and software for controlling other electronic devices via a control network.
A main memory 132 may be communicably coupled to the CPU 131, which may store data and executable code. The main memory 132 may represent volatile memory such as RAM, but may also include nonvolatile memory, such as read-only memory (ROM) or Flash memory. In buffering or caching data related to operations of the CPU 131, the main memory 132 may store data associated with applications running on the portable electronic device 13.
The portable electronic device 13 may also include nonvolatile storage 133. The nonvolatile storage 133 may represent any suitable nonvolatile storage medium, such as a hard disk drive or nonvolatile memory, such as Flash memory. Being well-suited to long-term storage, the nonvolatile storage 133 may store data files such as media (e.g., music and video files), software (e.g., for implementing functions on the portable electronic device 13), preference information (e.g., room and resource preset preferences), wireless connection information (e.g., information that may enable media device to establish a wireless connection such as a control network connection) and identity information (information to identify a user) and access information (information that may enable an individual to access restricted areas).
It should be appreciated that data associated with maintaining, scheduling and initiating a conference schedule may be saved in the nonvolatile storage 133. Nonvolatile storage 133 includes one or more software engines operable to enable the maintenance, management, scheduling, initiating, publication, presentation, provision and/or other data manipulation capability of resource availability and reservation information as well as perform other operations. Depending upon implementation, various aspects of teachings of the present invention may be implemented in a single software engine, in a plurality of software engines, in one or more hardwired components or in a combination of hardwired and software systems.
In addition to one or more software engines, nonvolatile storage 133 also includes one or more data storage areas. Data storage area is operably associated with the main memory and CPU 131. Data storage area of non-volatile storage may be leveraged to maintain data concerning the availability of one or more conference rooms or resources maintained for reservation, descriptive information concerning the one or more resources maintained for reservation, preset information, preset parameters, shared documentation, as well as other information pertinent to the management, maintenance, scheduling, initiating, publication, presentation and/or provision of resource availability and reservation information. Data storage area, or portions thereof, may also be utilized to store myriad other data.
Depending upon implementation, nonvolatile storage 133 may be implemented within a portable electronic device 13, in a storage area network operably coupled to a portable electronic device 13, and/or in other storage media, including removable media, compatible with and accessible by portable electronic device 13. In one embodiment, the one or more software engines and data storage areas cooperate in the management of the one or more conference room schedules, according to teachings of the present invention.
A display 134 may display images and data for the portable electronic device 13. It should be appreciated that only certain embodiments may include the display 134. The display 134 may be any suitable display 134, such as liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode (LED) based display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) based display, a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, or an analog or digital television. In some embodiments, the display 134 may function as a touch screen through which a user may interact with the portable electronic device 13.
The portable electronic device 13 may further include a user interface 135. The user interface 135 may represent indicator lights and user input structures, but may also include a graphical user interface (GUI) on the display 134. In practice, the user interface 135 may operate via the CPU 131, using memory from the main memory and long-term storage in the nonvolatile storage. In an embodiment lacking the display 134, indicator lights, sound devices, buttons, and other various input/output (I/O) devices may allow a user to interface with the portable electronic device 13. In an embodiment having a GUI, the user interface 135 may provide interaction with interface elements on the display 134 via certain user input structures, user input peripherals such as a keyboard or mouse, or a touch sensitive implementation of the display 134. The user may interact with the graphic user interface via touch means on a touch screen, input means via one or more keyboard buttons, mouse buttons etc., or voice instructions.
As should be appreciated, one or more applications may be open and accessible to a user via the user interface 135 and displayed on the display 134 of the portable electronic device 13. The applications may run on the CPU 131 in conjunction with the main memory 132, the nonvolatile storage 133, the display 134, and the user interface 135. The applications may run on the CPU 131 in conjunction with the main memory, the nonvolatile storage, the display, and the user interface. As will be discussed below, instructions stored in the main memory, the nonvolatile storage, or the CPU 131 of the portable electronic device 13 may enable a user to access and manage a schedule for a building. For example, a user may view and manipulate one or more schedules for a building or search for an available conference room based on resources and availability. As such, it should be appreciated that the instructions for carrying out such techniques on the portable electronic device 13 may represent a standalone application, a function of the operating system of the portable electronic device 13, or a function of the hardware of the CPU 131, the main memory, the nonvolatile storage, or other hardware of the portable electronic device 13.
One such application that may be open and accessible to the user is a scheduling application 20 for enabling access to a scheduling server 15. For example, the scheduling application 20 may be mobile application based on Fusion RV software available from Crestron Electronics, Inc. of Rockleigh, N.J. The scheduling application 20 may provide similar functionality as the Fusion RV software by enabling a user to: check the availability of one or more conference rooms; book one or more conference rooms for a predefined time either presently or at some future date; search for a desirable conference room based on availability and resources such as size, AV equipment, catering, etc., determine the direction of a desired conference room based on the location of the NFC tag 11; and check-in to a meeting and end a meeting. By checking in and ending a meeting, actions may be triggered from an accompanying control system controlling one or more devices and environmental aspects of the conference room.
Additionally, because the portable electronic device 13 may be used to identify a user, the scheduling application 20 may provide additional functionality. The scheduling software may know the identity of a user booking a conference room remotely and update the schedule of the conference room and the user accordingly. Additionally, a control system in communication with the scheduling software may alter one or more control settings based on the user. For example, the scheduling application may communicate personal settings for the conference room to the control network. The scheduling application may check user identity against a database to determine access rights for the user to view or manage the schedule of an area or resource. A user may have limited or no access to certain areas or resources based on time of day, priority, employment level or a myriad of other factors.
The scheduling application 20, such as Crestron Roomview or other similar scheduling application 20 may be downloaded from an application marketplace such as from the Google Play application marketplace or the Apple iTunesÂ® application marketplace. The portable electronic device 13 communicates with a scheduling server 15 to upload and/or download one or more aspects of availability data associated with a conference room or resource to be maintained for reservation. Upon opening, the scheduling application 20 may communicate with a scheduling server 15 to download a project file of the facility. In another embodiment, the scheduling application 20 may not require a local file for the facility and may be completely web-based. The project file may comprise information regarding the facility such as the number and type of conference rooms, the resources available for each conference room and information regarding the control system associated with the conference room, such as information enabling communication with one or more control processors.
The scheduling application 20 comprises a series of menu pages each further comprising selectable elements and graphical elements. One or more of the menu pages may comprise a schedule of a conference room 101. The portable electronic device 13 transmits information to the scheduling server 15 according to inputs from the user. Additionally, the scheduling server 15 may communicate with the portable electronic device 13, such as by providing updates to the schedule and providing feedback such as confirmation notices to the portable electronic device 13.
In certain embodiments, the portable electronic device 13 may include location sensing circuitry 136. The location sensing circuitry 136 may represent global positioning system (GPS) circuitry, but may also represent one or more algorithms and databases, stored in the nonvolatile storage or main memory and executed by the CPU 131, which may be used to infer location based on various observed factors. For example, the location sensing circuitry may represent an algorithm and database used to approximate geographic location based on the detection of local 802.11x (Wi-Fi) networks or nearby cellular phone towers.
The portable electronic device 13 may also include a wired input/output (I/O) interface 137 for a wired interconnection between one electronic device and another electronic device. The wired I/O interface 137 may represent, for example, a universal serial bus (USB) port or an IEEE 1394 or FireWireÂ® port, but may also represent a proprietary connection. Additionally, the wired I/O 137 interface may permit a connection to user input peripheral devices, such as a keyboard or a mouse.
An infrared (IR) interface may enable the portable electronic device 13 to receive and/or transmit signals with infrared light. By way of example, the IR interface may comply with an infrared IrDA specification for data transmission. Alternatively, the IR interface may function exclusively to receive control signals or to output control signals. In this way, the portable electronic device 13 may issue signals to control other electronic devices that may lack other interfaces for communication.
One or more network interfaces 138 may provide additional connectivity for the portable electronic device 13. The network interfaces 138 may represent, for example, one or more network interface cards (NIC) or a network controller. In certain embodiments, the network interface 138 may include a personal area network (PAN) interface 138 a. The PAN interface 138 a may provide capabilities to network with, for example, a BluetoothÂ® network, an IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., ZigBee) network, or an ultra wideband network (UWB). As should be appreciated, the networks accessed by the PAN interface 138 a may, but do not necessarily, represent low power, low bandwidth, or close range wireless connections. The PAN interface 138 a may permit one electronic device to connect to another local electronic device via an ad-hoc or peer-to-peer connection. However, the connection may be disrupted if the separation between the two electronic devices exceeds the range of the PAN interface.
The network interface may also include a local area network (LAN) interface 138 b. The LAN interface 138 b may represent an interface to a wired Ethernet-based network, but may also represent an interface to a wireless LAN, such as an IEEE 802.11x wireless network. The range of the LAN interface 138 b may generally exceed the range available via the PAN interface 138 a. Additionally, in many cases, a connection between two electronic devices via the LAN interface 138 b may involve communication through a network router or other intermediary device.
For some embodiments of the portable electronic device 13, the network interfaces 138 may include the capability to connect directly to a wide area network (WAN) via a WAN interface 138 c. The WAN interface 138 c may permit a connection to a cellular data network, such as the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) network or other 3G network. When connected via the WAN interface 138 c, the portable electronic device 13 may remain connected to the Internet and, in some embodiments, to another electronic device, despite changes in location that might otherwise disrupt connectivity via the PAN interface 138 a or the LAN interface 138 b. As will be discussed below, the wired I/O interface 137 and the network interfaces 138 may represent high-bandwidth communication channels for transferring user data using the simplified data transfer techniques discussed herein.
The portable electronic device 13 may also include a near field communication (NFC) interface 139. The NFC interface 139 may allow for extremely close range communication at relatively low data rates (e.g., 464 kb/s), and may comply with such standards as ISO 18092 or ISO 21521, or it may allow for close range communication at relatively high data rates (e.g., 560 Mbps), and may comply with the TransferJetÂ® protocol. The NFC interface 139 may have a range of approximately 2 to 4 cm. The close range communication with the NFC interface 139 may take place via magnetic field induction, allowing the NFC interface 139 to communicate with other NFC interfaces or to retrieve information from tags having radio frequency identification (RFID) circuitry. As discussed below, the NFC interface 139 may provide a manner of initiating or facilitating a transfer of user data from one electronic device to another electronic device.
The portable electronic device 13 may also include a camera 140. With the camera 140, the portable electronic device 13 may obtain digital images or videos. In combination with optical character recognition (OCR) software, barcode-reading software, or matrix-code-reading software running on the portable electronic device 13, the camera 140 may be used to input data from printed materials having text or barcode information. Such data may include information indicating how to control another device from a matrix barcode that may be printed on the other device, as described below.
In certain embodiments of the portable electronic device 13, one or more accelerometers 141 may sense the movement or orientation of the portable electronic device 13. The accelerometers 141 may provide input or feedback regarding the position of the portable electronic device 13 to certain applications running on the CPU 131.
The one or more communication interfaces described above enables communications with a plurality of user communication devices via communication network. User communication devices which may be leveraged in accordance with teachings of the present invention include, without limitation, mobile telephone, personal digital assistant, computer system, video display/conferencing system, touch panel, laptop computer as well as other communication enabled devices.
Referring to FIG. 1, communication network 104 may include one or more gateway devices (not expressly shown). Other user communication devices may communicate with the gateway devices of communication network 104 just as portable electronic device 13 communicates with the gateway devices. In this manner, user communication devices may be in selective communication with portable electronic device 13 via the gateway devices and communication network 104.
The gateways of communication network 104 preferably provide portable electronic device 13 with an entrance to communication network 104 and may include software and/or hardware components to manage traffic entering and exiting communication network 104 and conversion between the communication protocols used by user communication devices, portable electronic device 13 and communication network 104. In certain embodiments, the gateways of communication network 104 may function as a proxy server and a firewall server for user communication devices as well as portable electronic device 13. Further, the gateways may be associated with a router (not expressly shown) operable to direct a given packet of data that arrives at a gateway and a switch (not expressly shown) operable to provide a communication path into and out of each gateway.
In one embodiment, communication network 104 may be a public switched telephone network (PSTN). In alternate embodiments, communication network 104 may include a cable telephony network, an IP (Internet Protocol) telephony network, a wireless network, a hybrid Cable/PSTN network, a hybrid IP/PSTN network, a hybrid wireless/PSTN network or any other suitable communication network or combination of communication networks. In addition, other network embodiments can be deployed with many variations in the number and type of devices, communication networks, the communication protocols, system topologies, and myriad other details without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
In one embodiment, user communication devices may include a variety of forms of equipment connected to communication network 104 and accessible to a user. User communication devices may be, employ or include telephones (wireline or wireless), dial-up modems, cable modems, DSL (digital subscriber line) modems, phone sets, fax equipment, answering machines, set-top boxes, televisions, POS (point-of-sale) equipment, PBX (private branch exchange) systems, personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), SDRs, other nascent technologies, or any other appropriate type or combination of communication equipment available to a user. User communication devices may be equipped for connectivity to communication network via a PSTN, DSLs, cable network, wireless network, or other communication channel.

The control system may control one or more of the following controllable devices: A/V devices including but not limited to content sources, content sinks, video recorders, audio receivers, speakers, and projectors; lighting devices 413 including but not limited to lamps, ballasts, light emitting diode (LED) drivers; HVAC devices 415 including but not limited to thermostats, occupancy sensors, air conditioning units, heating units, filtration systems, fans, humidifiers; shading elements 414 including but not limited to motorized window treatments, dimmable windows; security elements 416 including but not limited to security cameras, monitors and door locks; household appliances including but not limited to refrigerators, ovens, blenders, microwaves; control devices including but not limited to switches, relays, current limiting devices; and industrial devices including but not limited to motors, pumps, chillers, and air compressors.
One or more network interfaces may provide connectivity for the AV and control system processors (collectively processors). The network interface may represent, for example, one or more NICs or a network controller. In certain embodiments, the network interface may include a PAN interface. The PAN interface may provide capabilities to network with, for example, a BluetoothÂ® network, an IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g. Zigbee network), or an ultra wideband network. As should be appreciated, the networks accessed by the PAN interface may, but do not necessarily, represent low power, low bandwidth, or close range wireless connections. The PAN interface may permit one electronic device to connect to another local electronic device via an ad-hoc or peer-to-peer connection. However, the connection may be disrupted if the separation between the two electronic devices exceeds the range of the PAN interface.
The network interface may also include a LAN interface. The LAN interface may represent an interface to a wired Ethernet-based network but may also represent an interface to a wireless LAN, such as an 802.11x wireless network. The range of the LAN interface may generally exceed the range available via the PAN interface. Additionally, in many cases, a connection between two electronic devices via the LAN interface may involve communication through a network router or other intermediary device.
Ethernet connectivity enables integration with IP-controllable devices and allows the processors to be part of a larger managed control network. Whether residing on a sensitive corporate LAN, a home network, or accessing the Internet through a cable modem, the control processor may provide secure, reliable interconnectivity with IP-enabled devices, such as touch screens, computers, mobile devices, video displays, Blu-ray DiscÂ® players, media servers, security systems, lighting, HVAC, and other equipmentâboth locally and globally.
The processors may also include one or more wired input/output (I/O) interface for a wired connection between one electronic device and another electronic device. One or more wired interfaces may represent a serial port, for example a COM port or a USB port. Additionally, the wired I/O interface may represent, for example, a Cresnet port. Cresnet provides a network wiring solution for Crestron keypads, lighting controls, thermostats, and other devices that don't require the higher speed of Ethernet. The Cresnet bus offers wiring and configuration, carrying bidirectional communication and 24 VDC power to each device over a simple 4-conductor cable.
One or more IR interfaces may enable the processors to receive and/or transmit signals with infrared light. The IR interface may comply with an infrared IrDA specification for data transmission. Alternatively, the IR interface may function exclusively to receive control signals or to output control signals. The IR interface may provide a direct connection with one or more devices such as a centralized AV sources, video displays, and other devices.
One or more programmable relay ports may enable the processors to control window shades, projection screens, lifts, power controllers, and other contact-closure actuated equipment. One or more âVersiportâ I/O ports may enable the integration of occupancy sensors, power sensors, door switches, or anything device that provides a dry contact closure, low-voltage logic, or 0-10 Volt DC signal.
For some embodiments of the processors, the network interfaces may include the capability to connect directly to a WAN via a WAN interface. The WAN interface may permit connection to a cellular data network, such as the EDGE network or other 3G network. When connected via the WAN interface, the processors may remain connected to the Internet and, in some embodiments, to another electronic device, despite changes in location that might otherwise disrupt connectivity via the PAN interface or the LAN interface.
By leveraging remote access of the processors, a user may control the devices or environment settings in a building from anywhere in the world using a portable electronic device 13.
The portable electronic device 13 communicates with a scheduling server 15 to upload and/or download one or more aspects of availability data associated with a resource to be maintained for reservation. For example, a user may upload or download information concerning one or more resources from or to one or more applications maintained by the user on a local computer, personal digital assistant, or other information handling system as well from a user maintained network site such as a web-based calendaring application or another content site. Examples of applications or utilities from which information may be uploaded or to which information may be downloaded another, without limitation, Microsoft OutlookÂ®, Yahoo! CalendarÂ®, Lotus NotesÂ®, as well as other calendaring applications.
 FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an NFC tag 11 employed in the system of FIG. 1 in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. The portable electronic device 13 reads the NFC tag 11 to quickly access the schedule of one or more conference rooms. The NFC tag 11 encodes an application identifier 113 and an area address 115, such as a uniform resource locator (URL) for the room. In an embodiment of the invention, the NFC tag 11 is configured for being read by an NFC interface in a passive communication mode. In this mode, the NFC tag 11 draws its operating power from the electromagnetic field provided by the NFC interface of the initiator device. Advantageously, the NFC tag 11 does not require a power supply for operation.
The NFC tag 11 may be an element of a control point located in or near the conference room or may be an independent device disposed on a surface located in or near the conference room. For example, the control point may provide limited functionality, such as displaying the status and schedule of the room, while the portable electronic device 13 provides the interface to access the scheduling program to manipulate the schedule of the room or to view and manipulate the schedule of other conference rooms.
Referring now to FIG. 4, one embodiment of a scheduling application 20 comprising a collection of software engines and data storage areas is shown according to teachings of the present invention.

The NFC tag 11 is configured for manipulating the generated electromagnetic field according to the encoded information via load modulation. The NFC interface of the portable electronic device 13 reads the encoded information from the modulated electromagnetic field.
In embodiments of the invention in which the NFC tag 11 encodes information in addition to the application identifier 113 and the server URL for the room the NFC interface reads this information from the NFC tag 11, as well.
In step 1703, the smart phone loads the scheduling application 20 according to the application identifier 113. The application identifier 113 read from the NFC tag 11, instructs the portable electronic device 13 which scheduling application 20 to launch.
In step 1704, upon launching the scheduling application 20, the scheduling application 20 is configured for establishing communication with the scheduling server 15 according to the URL encoded on the NFC tag 11. The scheduling application 20 may communicate the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 to the scheduling server 15 thereby allowing the scheduling server 15 to determine the identity and location of the user.
In step 1705, the scheduling application 20 displays a calendar of the schedule application according to the address of the conference room received via the NFC tag 11. The schedule may be displayed as a spreadsheet containing one or more columns corresponding to one or more days and rows corresponding to one or more time periods, such as fifteen minute increments. Time periods in which the conference room is booked may be highlighted a first color such as red and time periods in which the conference room is available may be displayed as not highlighted. Additionally, information concerning the event for which a room is booked may be listed in the relevant cell.
In step 1706, the scheduling application 20 receives on or more inputs for reserving a conference room. From the calendar page of the scheduling application 20, a user may book the room during an available time period by selecting the time period. The user may select the time period by selecting one or more cells from the scheduling application 20 or from a scheduling content page which the scheduling application 20 may display.
In step 1707, the scheduling application 20 displays one or more preset parameters for receiving preset information detailing the meeting. The scheduling content page may comprise one or more fields to determine one or more of the following: date of the event, the start time of the event, the end time of the event, a title of the event, the number of attendees of the event, the name of the event, shared documentation for the event, resources required for the event, presets for the resources, and environmental conditions for event.
In step 1708, the scheduling application 20 receives one or more preset information detailing the meeting. For example, the scheduling application 20 may receive the start time and end time of the meeting, the subject of the meeting, the recurrence of the meeting, participants in the meeting, the type of meeting and conference information associated with the meeting, a welcome message and an image.
Additionally, the user may access a search content page (503, FIG. 5) which will allow a user to search for an available conference room. The search may be dependent on one or more of the following: date of the event, start time of the event, end time of the event, number of attendees, and required resources.
Further from the scheduling application 20, the user may start the meeting and end a meeting early. For example, the scheduling application 20 may recognize the user ID of the portable electronic device 13 and the location of the NFC tag 11 and at an appropriate time display a selectable item for starting the meeting. While the meeting is in progress, the scheduling application 20 may then display a selectable icon for ending the meeting.
 FIG. 18 shows an exemplary embodiment of a system 100 for managing a conference room schedule in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that the exemplary embodiment of system 100 illustrated in FIG. 18 may be varied in one or more aspects without departing from the spirit and scope of the teachings disclosed herein.
In this embodiment, the identification unit comprises one or more RF beacons 18. The one or more RF beacons 18 may be configured for communicating via Bluetooth 4.0 protocols. Specifically, the RF beacons 18 may utilize Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy protocol to broadcast information.
The RF beacons 18 periodically broadcast information comprising their beacon ID 185 and an application identifier 113. The beacon ID 185 may be an identification number independent of location, such as network address, or may be a location such as coordinates or a room address. There are advantages associated with each of these schemes. By broadcasting beacon ID 185 as a location, the portable electronic device 13 does not need to match an identity with a location. Accordingly, no lookup tables associating an address to a location need be stored by the portable electronic device. However, each beacon must then be dedicated to a certain location or configured to broadcast a different location as a beacon ID 185 upon redeployment.
Contrastingly, by broadcasting a network address as a beacon ID 185, the location need not be programmed on the RF beacon and the beacons 18 may be relocated after deployment without reprogramming the beacon. However, the scheduling application may then require a lookup table indexing address with location.
In an embodiment of the invention, the beacon ID 185 is the room address 115 (i.e. scheduling server address). In this embodiment, the scheduling application may then be configured to match scheduling server address with a room to determine location. For example, the scheduling application may comprise a lookup table listing scheduling server addresses by location in the facility. In another embodiment of the invention, each RF beacon 18 is configured for transmitting both a beacon ID 185 and a scheduling server address 115.
Preferably, a plurality of RF beacons 18 are placed strategically throughout a structure to enable the portable electronic device to be in communication range with three RF beacons 18 at any time. In this embodiment, the system comprises at least three RF beacons 18. Advantageously, this allows for estimation of location to a point using trilateration. In other embodiments, with less than three RF beacons 18, location may be estimated within a range.
However, it should be noted that the system may comprise less than three RF beacons 18. The particular layout of a structure may only require that a portable electronic device be in communication with one or two RF beacons 18 to accurately determine in which room or location the portable electronic device is located.
The personal area network interface of the portable electronic device 13 is configured for determining the received signal strength of each received beacon broadcast. For example, the personal area network interface may measure signal strength of broadcasts by received signal strength indicator (RSSI). By utilizing the received signal strength of each beacon, the portable electronic device 13 may estimate its distance to each beacon 18. The scheduling application 20 may comprise a lookup table indexing distances from beacon to RSSI. Accordingly, by mapping the beacon ID 185 to a location in the facility and by determining its distance to one or more beacons 18, the portable electronic device 13 may determine its location in a facility.
 FIG. 19 shows a schematic of a facility with a plurality of rooms, each comprising an RF beacon 18 a-n, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. For example, the facility may be a corporate building comprising offices and conference rooms. An RF beacon 18 a-n is placed in each room of the facility. The RF beacon 18 a-n may be placed in a common location such as a light switch or touch panel or may be placed in a remote location out of view. Each RF beacon 18 a-n periodically, transmits its beacon ID 185, the application identifier 113 and in some embodiments, the scheduling server address 115. The portable electronic device 13 periodically listens for RF beacon transmissions. The scheduling application 20 determines a first distance 181, a second distance 182 and a third distance 183 to a first RF beacon 18 a, a second RF beacon 18 b, and a third RF beacon 18 c, respectively. Preferably, the scheduling application 20 determines the first distance 181, the second distance 182 and the third distance 183 with the three RF beacons 18 a-c with the strongest received signal according to RSSI. The scheduling application 20 may determine its location by calculating the intersection of a first range with the first distance 181 as a radius, a second range with the second distance 182 as a radius, and a third range with the third distance 183 as a radius. By strategically placing RF beacons 18 a-n throughout a facility, the portable electronic device 13 may determine its location throughout the facility by periodically calculating its range to any three RF beacons 18 a-n.  
 FIG. 20 is a flowchart 2000 showing steps for performing a method managing a conference room schedule via communication with an RF beacon 18, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. In step 2001, a user positions the portable electronic device 13 such that the PAN interface is in communication range with a first RF beacon 18 a, a second RF beacon 18 b, and a third RF beacon 18 c. The user may position the portable electronic device 13 by simply walking within while carrying the portable electronic device.
In step 2002, the portable electronic device 13 receives the information broadcast by the first RF beacon 18 a, second RF beacon 18 b, and third RF beacon 18 c, such as the application identifier 113 and each beacon ID 185. In embodiments of the invention, each RF beacon additionally broadcasts a URL for accessing the schedule of the location on a scheduling server.
In step 2003, the portable electronic device 13 loads the scheduling application 20 according to the application identifier 113. The application identifier 113 received from the RF beacons 18, instructs the portable electronic device 13 which scheduling application 20 to launch.
In step 2004, the scheduling application 20 estimates a distance to the RF beacon 18. By utilizing the received signal strength of each beacon 18, the scheduling application 20 may determine its distance from each RF beacon 18. In an embodiment of the invention, the PAN interface of the portable electronic device 13 measures the RSSI of each received broadcast and utilizes a lookup table listing distance to beacon by RSSI to determine a distance to the RF beacon 18.
In another embodiment of the invention, the PAN interface may compare the ratio of received signal strength to broadcast signal strength to determine a distance to the beacons 18. In this embodiment, the broadcast signal strength of the RF beacon 18 may be a known quantity. In another embodiment of the invention, the RF beacon 18 broadcasts this quantity.
In this embodiment, the portable electronic device 13 continues listening until receiving a broadcast from three RF beacons 18 a-c. In embodiments in which more than three beacons 18 are in range, the scheduling application 20 may use the three strongest received signals. Additionally, the scheduling application 20 may use the identity and signal strength of additional RF beacons 18 as an error check or redundancy. The scheduling application 20 repeats steps 2004 for each of the RF beacons 18 thereby estimating a range to at least three RF beacons 18.
In step 2005, the scheduling application 20 determines its location according to the location information received from the RF beacons 18 via trilateration. The position of each RF beacon 18 is known by the scheduling application 20 as well as an estimated distance to at least three RF beacons 18, the scheduling application 20 may determine its location in coordinates. By determining the intersection point of the three ranges to three RF beacons 18, the scheduling application 20 may determine the location of the portable electronic device 13.
The scheduling application 20 maps to a floor plan of the facility to determine a location by room or area. By mapping the location to a floor plan, the scheduling application may know which room the portable electronic device, and therefore the user, is located.
In step 2006, upon launching the scheduling application 20, the scheduling application 20 is configured for establishing communication with the scheduling server 15 according to a URL of the room stored by the scheduling application 20 or received from the RF beacon 18. The scheduling application 20 may communicate the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 to the scheduling server 15 thereby allowing the scheduling server 15 to determine the identity and location of the user.
However as will be discussed in reference to FIG. 21, in certain embodiments the portable electronic device 13 may not be configured to communicate via the communication network 104 (FIG. 18). In these applications, the one or more RF beacons 18 may act as an intermediary gateway between the portable electronic device 13 and the control processor 40/42.
In step 2007, the scheduling application 20 displays a schedule of the schedule application 20 according to the location of the portable electronic device 13. The schedule may be displayed as a spreadsheet containing one or more columns corresponding to one or more days and rows corresponding to one or more time periods, such as fifteen minute increments. Time periods in which the conference room is booked may be highlighted a first color such as red and time periods in which the conference room is available may be displayed as not highlighted. Additionally, information concerning the event for which a room is booked may be listed in the relevant cell.
In step 2008, the scheduling application 20 receives on or more inputs for reserving a conference room. From the calendar page of the scheduling application 20, a user may book the room during an available time period by selecting the time period. The user may select the time period by selecting one or more cells from the scheduling application 20 or from a scheduling content page which the scheduling application 20 may display.
In step 2009, the scheduling application 20 displays one or more preset parameters 106 for receiving preset information 107 detailing the meeting. The scheduling content page may comprise one or more fields to determine one or more of the following: date of the event, the start time of the event, the end time of the event, a title of the event, the number of attendees of the event, the name of the event, shared documentation for the event, resources required for the event, presets for the resources, and environmental conditions for event.
In step 2010, the scheduling application 20 receives one or more preset information 107 detailing the meeting. For example, the scheduling application 20 may receive the start time and end time of the meeting, the subject of the meeting, the recurrence of the meeting, participants in the meeting, the type of meeting and conference information associated with the meeting, a welcome message and an image.
Additionally, the user may access a search content page which will allow a user to search for an available conference room. The search may be dependent on one or more of the following: date of the event, start time of the event, end time of the event, number of attendees, and required resources.
Further from the scheduling application 20, the user may start the meeting and end a meeting early. For example, the scheduling application 20 may recognize the user ID and location of the portable electronic device 13 and at an appropriate time display a selectable item for starting the meeting. While the meeting is in progress, the scheduling application 20 may then display a selectable icon for ending the meeting.
 FIG. 21 is a flowchart showing steps for performing a method for managing a conference room schedule via communication with an RF beacon 18, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention.
In certain embodiments the portable electronic device 13 may not be configured to communicate via the communication network 104. In these applications, the one or more RF beacons 18 may act as an intermediary gateway between the portable electronic device 13 and the control processor 40/42.
In this method, steps 2001, 2003-2005, 2007-2010 are performed in substantially the same manner as in the method shown in FIG. 20.
In step 2102, the portable electronic device 13 receives the information broadcast by the first RF beacon 18 a, second RF beacon 18 b, and third RF beacon 18 c, such as the application identifier 113 and each beacon ID 185. In contrast to the method shown in FIG. 20, the RF beacon 18 does not broadcast and the portable electronic device 13 need not receive a URL for the scheduling server 15.
In step 2106 a, upon launching the scheduling application 20, the scheduling application 20 pairs the portable electronic device 13 to the nearest RF beacon 18 using RF communication protocols such as Bluetooth communication protocols. The scheduling application 20 may determine the nearest RF beacon 18 based on signal strength of the received broadcast or by looking up the nearest RF beacon 18 to its location from a stored directory.
In step 2106 b, the scheduling application 20 may communicate the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 to the paired RF beacon 18 which in turn may communicate to the scheduling server 15 thereby allowing the scheduling server 15 to determine the identity and location of the user. The RF beacon 18 and the scheduling server 15 may communicate via a LAN or PAN.
 FIGS. 22A-22B is a flowchart 2200 a-b showing steps for performing a method of accessing a conference room schedule, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. In step 2201, a user positions the portable electronic device 13 such that the NFC interface is in communication range with the NFC tag 11. The user may tap a surface of the phone near the NFC tag 11 or position the NFC interface of the portable electronic device 13 to within a range of approximately two to four centimeters of the NFC tag 11.
In step 2202, the portable electronic device 13 reads the information encoded on the NFC tag 11, such as the application identifier 113, and URL 115 of the scheduling server 15, over an NFC communication channel 111. Upon placing the portable electronic device 13 within NFC communication range of the NFC tag 11, the NFC interface of the portable electronic device 13 creates an electromagnetic field, thereby energizing the NFC tag 11. The NFC tag 11 is configured for manipulating the generated electromagnetic field according to the encoded information via load modulation. The NFC interface of the portable electronic device 13 reads the encoded information from the modulated electromagnetic field.
In embodiments of the invention in which the NFC tag 11 encodes information in addition to the application identifier 113 and the server URL 115 the NFC interface reads this information from the NFC tag 11, as well.
In step 2203, the smart phone 13 loads the scheduling application 20 according to the application identifier 113. The application identifier 113 read from the NFC tag 11, instructs the portable electronic device 13 which scheduling application 20 to launch.
In step 2204, upon launching the scheduling application 20, the scheduling application 20 is configured for establishing communication with the scheduling server 15 according to the URL 115 encoded on the NFC tag 11. The scheduling application 20 may communicate the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 to the scheduling server 15 thereby allowing the scheduling server to determine the identity and location of the user.
In step 2205, the scheduling application 20 checks the access of the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20. The scheduling application 20 may check against a database to determine whether the user may view the schedule of that area, book meetings on the schedule of the area and with what preset resources and the role of the user ID in any meetings scheduled for the area.
If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does not have access to view the schedule of the area, in step 2206, the scheduling application 20 displays an error page.
If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does have permission to view the schedule of the area but not to manage it, in step 2207, the scheduling application 20 displays the schedule of the area without selectable time periods allowing to schedule a meeting. For example, the schedule may be a view only schedule or may allow the user to select meetings to view information about the meetings. The user will not, however, be presented with selectable time periods.
If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does have permission to view the schedule of the area and permission to manage it, in step 2208, the scheduling application 20 displays the schedule of the area with selectable time periods allowing to schedule a meeting.
In step 2209, the scheduling application 20 receives one or more inputs selecting a meeting from the schedule. From the calendar page of the scheduling application 20, a user may select one of the selectable time periods with a meeting status indicator.
If the user ID is not an organizer of the meeting, as determined by the access of the user ID, in step 2210, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop-up menu with meeting information such as in FIG. 8. The user may view information about the meeting comprising the organizer, the subject, the start and end time, the date and the attendees.
If the user ID is an organizer of the meeting, as determined by the access of the user ID, in step 2211, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop-up menu with meeting information and selectable icons for starting a meeting 901 and ending a meeting 902 such as in FIG. 9.
As will be discussed in reference to step 2216, if the meeting comprises the preset resource of a presentation or lecture capture device, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop menu further comprising selectable icons to start recording 903, pause recording 904, and stop recording 905, such as in FIG. 9.
In step 2212, the scheduling application 20 receives a selection to start the meeting. For example, a user may select a âstart meetingâ icon 901 of the pop-up menu page 900 in FIG. 9.
In step 2213, the scheduling application 20 transmits one or more control signals in response to receiving a selection of the âstart meetingâ icon 901.
In step 2214, the scheduling application 20 receives a selection to stop the meeting. For example, a user may select a âstop meetingâ icon 902 of the pop-up menu page 900 in FIG. 9.
In step 2215, the scheduling application 20 transmits one or more control signals in response to receiving a selection of the âstop meetingâ icon 902.
In step 2216, if the meeting comprises the preset resource of a presentation or lecture capture device, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop menu 900 further comprising selectable icons to start recording 903, pause recording 904, and stop recording 905, such as in FIG. 9.
In step 2217, the scheduling application 20 receives a selection to start recording the meeting. For example, a user may select a âstart recordingâ icon 903 of the pop-up menu page 900 in FIG. 9.
In step 2218, the scheduling application 20 transmits one or more control signals in response to receiving a selection of the âstart recordingâ icon 903.
In step 2219, the scheduling application 20 receives a selection to stop recording the meeting. For example, a user may select a âstop recordingâ icon 905 of the pop-up menu page 900 in FIG. 9.
In step 2220, the scheduling application 20 transmits one or more control signals in response to receiving a selection of the âstop recordingâ icon 905.
 FIGS. 23A-B is a flowchart 2300 a-b showing steps for performing a method of accessing a conference room schedule, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention.

In step 2303, the portable electronic device 13 loads the scheduling application 20 according to the application identifier 113. The application identifier 113 received from the RF beacons 18, instructs the portable electronic device 13 which scheduling application 20 to launch.
In step 2304, the scheduling application 20 estimates a distance to at least three RF beacons 18 a-c. By utilizing the received signal strength of each beacon 18, the scheduling application may determine its distance from each RF beacon 18. In an embodiment of the invention, the PAN interface of the portable electronic device 13 measures the RSSI of each received broadcast and utilizes a lookup table listing distance to beacon by RSSI to determine a distance to the RF beacon 18.
In this embodiment, the portable electronic device 13 continues listening until receiving a transmission from three RF beacons 18 a-c. In embodiments in which more than three beacons 18 are in range, the scheduling application 20 may use the three strongest received signals. Additionally, the scheduling application 20 may use the identity and signal strength of additional RF beacons 18 as an error check or redundancy.

If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does not have access to view the schedule of the area, in step 2308, the scheduling application 20 displays an error page.
If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does have permission to view the schedule of the area but not to manage it, in step 2309, the scheduling application 20 displays the schedule of the area without selectable time periods allowing to schedule a meeting. For example, the schedule may be a view only schedule or may allow the user to select meetings to view information about the meetings. The user will not, however, be presented with selectable time periods.
If the user ID associated with the scheduling application 20 does have permission to view the schedule of the area and permission to manage it, in step 2310, the scheduling application 20 displays the schedule of the area with selectable time periods allowing to schedule a meeting.
In step 2311, the scheduling application 20 receives one or more inputs selecting a meeting from the schedule. From the calendar page of the scheduling application 20, a user may select one of the selectable time periods with a meeting status indicator.
If the user ID is not an organizer of the meeting, as determined by the access of the user ID, in step 2312, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop-up menu with meeting information such as in FIG. 8. The user may view information about the meeting comprising the organizer, the subject, the start and end time, the date and the attendees.
If the user ID is an organizer of the meeting, as determined by the access of the user ID, in step 2313, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop-up menu with meeting information and selectable icons for starting a meeting and ending a meeting such as in FIG. 9.
As will be discussed in reference to step 2318, if the meeting comprises the preset resource of a presentation or lecture capture device, the scheduling application 20 displays a pop menu further comprising selectable icons to start recording, pause recording, and stop recording.

In step 2322, the scheduling application 20 transmits one or more control signals in response to receiving a selection of the âstop recordingâ icon.
In addition to scheduling meeting rooms, the systems of the present embodiments leverage short range communication technologies, such as Near Field Communication and Bluetooth, to enable enterprise end users to easily and quickly utilize their portable electronic devices 13, such as smartphones, to connect to and efficiently utilize devices or equipment located within one or more areas in a facility, such as conference room devices 102 in meeting room 101 in a corporate facility (FIGS. 1 and 18). One or more portable electronic devices 13, such as a smartphone, can pair with one or more meeting room devices 102 via one or more beacons 18 (or NFC tags 11) allowing the enterprise end user to utilize and control the resources provided in the meeting room. The one or more beacons 18 are configured to broadcast information via short-range communication. The end user's portable electronic device 13 comprises one or more software applications configured for reading the broadcasted information, using that information to pair with the meeting room devices or equipment 102, and allowing the end users to utilize and control the meeting room devices or equipment 102. These one or more software applications, as well as the scheduling application 20 discussed above, can comprise modules of an enterprise meeting application designed to enable enterprise end users to efficiently utilize meeting rooms.
 FIG. 24 shows an exemplary embodiment of a system 2400 for enabling enterprise end users to utilize their portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 to connect to and utilize presentation facilitating devices or equipment, such as a presentation gateway 2410, located within a meeting room 2401. Particularly, presentation system 2400 enables live presentation content sharing between meeting presenter's and meeting attendees' portable electronic devices during a meeting. It should be noted that the exemplary embodiments of presentation system 2400 may be varied in one or more aspects without departing from the spirit and scope of the teachings disclosed herein. While the embodiments are described herein as being implemented for presentation content sharing during a business meeting in a commercial conference room, it is not limited to such an implementation. The present embodiments may be employed to share presentation content in other venues, facilities, or gatherings where presentation content sharing is desired. For example, system 2400 may be employed within commercial, residential, retail, or non-profit venue structures, as well as for professional, education, entertainment, and general communication. Presentation content sharing of the present embodiments may be utilized in a small scale conference room with few attendees, during a mid-sized live lecture, or during a large scale seminar or commercial event with hundreds of attendees.
According to one embodiment, the presentation system 2400 includes a presentation gateway 2410, presenter portable electronic device 2402, a meeting room display 2406, attendee portable electronic device 2403, and one or more radio frequency beacons 2404 located within a meeting room 2401.

The following section describes the methods of pairing the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 to the presentation gateway 2410 via one or more beacons 2404 according to some aspects of the embodiments. However, the methods described herein can be used to pair portable electronic devices to other type of devices or equipment located within a meeting room.
The one or more beacons 2404 are configured to broadcast information via short-range communication 2411, such as Bluetooth Low Energy communication, NFC communication, or other short-range communication. The beacon 2404 is encoded with various information, which it periodically broadcasts for enabling one or more portable electronic devices 2402 to be paired with the meeting room devices, such as the presentation gateway 2410. FIG. 25 is a visual representation of a beacon 2404 according to an illustrative embodiment. In various aspects of the embodiments, beacon 2404 may be encoded with one or more of an application identifier 2501, a beacon ID 2502, one or more meeting room devices network addresses 2503, an enterprise server network address 2504, and any combinations thereof.
The application identifier 2501 identifies the application associated with the beacon 2404, such as the enterprise meeting application 2600 or presentation application 2601. In certain embodiments, the application identifier 2501 is encoded according to operating system requirements. For example, in the Android operating system, each program approved to be offered in the Google Play store requires an application identifier. This application identifier 2501 is understood by the Android operation system.
The beacon ID 2502 identifies the beacon 2404 and may comprise a universally unique identifier (UUID) of the beacon.
The meeting room device network address 2503 identifies the particular meeting room device associated with the beacon 2404 and located within the same meeting room. A meeting room device network address 2503 may comprise an IP address, a URI address, a URL address, a host name, or the like, or any combination thereof. A single beacon 2404 may be encoded with network addresses of a plurality of meeting room devices located within the same meeting room. For example, the meeting room device network address 2503 may comprise a presentation gateway network address that identifies the particular presentation gateway 2410 associated with the beacon 2404.
The enterprise server network address 2504 identifies the enterprise server 2412 associated with the beacon 2404, and may comprise an IP address, a URI address, a URL address, a host name, or the like. In various aspects of the embodiments, beacon 2404 may be encoded with all the information shown in FIG. 25, or it may comprise only some of the information, such as the application identifier 2501 and the beacon ID 2502.
According to one embodiment, system 2400 can comprises a standalone or semi-standalone system that can operate without or with minimal interactivity with a central management server, a system processor, such as system processor 40 or 42, or remote servers, such as an enterprise server 2412 and calendar server 2416. Such implementation is useful in a small scale application where the use of a central management server is impractical or undesired. The system 2400 can comprise one or more meeting room devices, such as presentation gateways 2410, and dedicated beacons 2404 strategically dispersed throughout a building or a floor. Each meeting room device can be associated with one or more dedicated beacons which store the network address of the meeting room device, such as an IP address, a URI address, a URL address, a host name, or the like. In one embodiment, one or more dedicated beacons are placed within the same meeting room as their associated meeting room devices. In another embodiment, a dedicated beacon can be integrated within the meeting room device, such as within the presentation gateway 2410. The dedicated beacon broadcasts an application ID and the network address of its associated meeting room device. The enterprise meeting application 2600 uses the network address to connect the portable communication device 2402, 2403 to the appropriate meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410.
 FIG. 27 is a flowchart 2700 showing a method for paring the presenter portable electronic device 2402 and/or the attendee portable electronic device 2403 with a meeting room device, such as a presentation gateway 2410, via one or more beacon 2404 of such a standalone or semi-standalone system according to an illustrative embodiment.
In step 2702, a user positions the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 in communication range with a beacon 2404. The user may position the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 by walking within the meeting room 2401 while carrying the portable electronic device 2402, 2403. In step 2704, the user loads the enterprise meeting application 2600, which instructs the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 to scan for any nearby beacons 2404. In step 2606, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives the information broadcasted by the beacon 2404. In the current embodiment, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives the application identifier 2501 and the meeting room device network address 2503, such as the presentation gateway network address, encoded in the beacon 2404. Upon receiving the application identifier 2501 and the meeting room device network address 2503 from a beacon in step 2606, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 provides that information to the enterprise meeting application 2600 based on the received application identifier 2501.
After the application is loaded and the broadcasted information from the beacon is read, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines whether any additional beacons are present in step 2708. If the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 detects the presence of only a single broadcasting beacon, in step 2718, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 uses the received meeting room device network address 2503 to pair with the meeting room device associated with the selected beacon. Particularly, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 establishes communication with the meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410, via the local area network 2408.
If there are additional broadcasting beacons detected, in step 2712, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives application identifiers and meeting room device network addresses from the additional beacons. In step 2714, the enterprise meeting application 2600 then estimates the distance of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 to each of the plurality of broadcasting beacons. For example, the personal area network interface of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 is configured for measuring the received signal strength of each received beacon broadcast. The enterprise meeting application 2600 may log the RSSI of each measured distances in a table according to signal strength.
In step 2716, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines the location of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 and selects the beacon associated with the location. In one embodiment, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines the location and selects the beacon by identifying the nearest beacon by comparing the received signal strengths and identifying the strongest received signal according to RSSI. In step 2718, the enterprise meeting application 2600 uses the meeting room device network address received from the selected beacon (e.g., the nearest beacon) to pair the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 with the corresponding meeting room device. In step 2720, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 communicates with the meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410, via local area network 2408. For example, the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can transmit the presentation content 2414 to the paired presentation gateway 2410, and the attendee portable electronic device 2403 can receive presentation content from the paired presentation gateway 2410.
According to one embodiment, each meeting room device associated with a beacon, such as the presentation gateway 2410, can comprise a network access point and a built-in web server associated with a unique URL address. Each meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410, can be associated with one or more beacons 2404 encoded with the corresponding unique URL address as the meeting room device network address 2503. Upon identifying the nearest beacon, such as beacon 2404, the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the portable communication device 2402, 2403 receives from the beacon 2404 the application identifier 2501 and the associated URL address of the meeting room device. The enterprise meeting application 2600 instructs the portable communication device 2402, 2403 to connect to the built-in server of the meeting room device via the unique URL address.
According to some aspects of the embodiments, the enterprise meeting application 2600 is automatically loaded on the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 once the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 comes in communication proximity with a beacon 2404. FIG. 28 illustrates a flowchart 2800 showing the method of automatically loading and/or installing the enterprise meeting application 2600 via a beacon. Referring to FIG. 28, in step 2802, a user positions the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 in communication range with a beacon 2404. The user may position the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 by walking within the meeting room 2401 while carrying the portable electronic device 2402, 2403.
In step 2804, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives the information broadcasted by the beacon, such as the application identifier 2501 encoded in the beacon. If after reading the application identifier 2501, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 determines in step 2806 that the application associated with the application identifier 2501 is not downloaded, in step 2808 the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 directs the user to an application marketplace where they can download the application associated with the application identifier 2501. For example, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 may load a relevant application page of the iTunesÂ® application marketplace or Google Play application marketplace.
If the enterprise meeting application 2600 associated with the application identifier 2501 is already stored on the portable electronic device 2402, 2403, in step 2810 the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 loads the enterprise meeting application 2600. The application identifier 2501 read from the beacon instructs the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 which application to launch. Thus, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 loads the enterprise meeting application 2600 upon receiving the application identifier 2501.
According to another embodiment, presentation system 2400 can be integrated into an enterprise-wide system, such as system 100 shown in FIG. 18, and can be connected to the enterprise server 2412, such as scheduling server 15 described above. Presentation system 2400 may further comprise additional servers, including a calendar server 2416 for receiving a user's calendar information. Calendar server 2416 can be integrated with the enterprise server 2412. Such an implementation is useful in large-scale enterprise control.
As described above, the enterprise server 2412 may store room information or record associated with each conference room in an enterprise, such as meeting room 2401. Such room data may include one or more of the following: the conference room name, a universally unique identifier (UUID) of the room, beacon ID associated with that room, location of the room in a room tree of a building, physical address of the building where the room is located, resources available in the room, such as conference room devices 102, maximum capacity of the room, an image of the room, associated calendar information for the room, access rights information, such as a list of users which have room access, among other type of information. For example, room data for meeting room 2401 may include the meeting room name (e.g., âRoom A113â), a UUID of the meeting room 2401, beacon ID of beacon 2404 located within meeting room 2401, information that the room is equipped with presentation gateway 2410 and display 2406, and the network address of the presentation gateway 2410. In such an implementation, the beacon 2404 may broadcast an application identifier and its beacon ID. Upon identifying the closest beacon, such as beacon 2404, the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives from the beacon 2404 the application identifier and its beacon ID. The enterprise meeting application 2600 receiving the beacon ID would query the enterprise server 2412 for the network address of the presentation gateway 2410.
 FIG. 29 illustrates one embodiment of a flowchart 2900 showing the method for pairing the presenter portable electronic device 2402 and/or the attendee portable electronic device 2403 with a meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410, via one or more beacons 2404 and the enterprise server 2412. In step 2902, a user positions the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 in communication range with a beacon 2404. The user may position the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 by walking within the meeting room 2401 while carrying the portable electronic device 2402, 2403.
In step 2904, the enterprise meeting application 2600 is loaded. The enterprise meeting application 2600 can be loaded manually by the user. In another embodiment, as described above with reference to FIG. 28, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can be loaded automatically or be downloaded upon receiving an application identifier 2501 from a beacon 2404.
After being loaded, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can instruct the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 to scan for any nearby beacons 2404. In step 2906, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives the information broadcasted by the beacon 2404. In this embodiment, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives the application identifier 2501 and the beacon ID 2502 encoded in the beacon 2404. Upon receiving the application identifier 2501 and beacon ID 2502 from a beacon in step 2906, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 provides that information to the enterprise meeting application 2600 based on the received application identifier 2501.
Then in step 2908, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines whether there are any additional beacons present. If in step 2908 the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 detects the presence of only a single broadcasting beacon, in step 2918, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 communicates the selected beacon ID to the enterprise server 2412. According to one embodiment, the enterprise meeting application 2600 contains in its memory the network address of the enterprise server 2412 to enable communication. In another embodiment, the enterprise meeting application 2600 receives the enterprise server network address 2504 from the selected beacon 2404 in order to connect with a correct enterprise server 2412 associated with the presentation system 2400.
If in step 2908 the enterprise meeting application 2600 detects additional broadcasting beacons, in step 2912, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 receives application identifiers and beacon IDs from the additional beacons. The enterprise meeting application 2600 then estimates the distance of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 to each of the plurality of broadcasting beacons in step 2914. For example, the personal area network interface of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 is configured for measuring the received signal strength of each received beacon broadcast. The enterprise meeting application 2600 may log the RSSI of each measured distances in a table according to signal strength.
In step 2916, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines the location of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403. In one embodiment, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines the location by identifying the nearest beacon. The enterprise meeting application 2600 selects the nearest beacon by comparing the received signal strengths and determining which beacon 2404 has the strongest signal according to RSSI. After selecting the nearest beacon 2404, the enterprise meeting application 2600 transmits the selected beacon ID to the enterprise server 2412 in step 2918. In step 2920, the enterprise server 2412 uses the transmitted beacon ID to identify the meeting room 2401 associated with the beacon 2404, and particularly, the meeting room device network addresses of the meeting room devices present in the meeting room 2401. The meeting room device network address may comprise an IP address, a URI address, a URL address, a host name, or the like.
According to another embodiment, the enterprise meeting application 2600 determines in which room the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 is located via trilateration as discussed above with reference to step 2005 of FIG. 20. For example, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can estimate its distance to at least three beacons, determine its location coordinates using trilateration, map that location on a floor plan, and identify the room the portable electronic device is located. The floor plan may be downloaded from the enterprise server 2412. The enterprise meeting application 2600 may communicate with the enterprise server 2412 to perform the above steps for determining the room location of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403, and some of the above steps may be performed by the enterprise server 2412 itself. Once the meeting room is identified, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can query the enterprise server 2412 for the room information associated with the identified meeting room to retrieve its associated meeting room device network addresses.
According to another embodiment, during setup, the enterprise meeting application 2600 downloads an enterprise room file from the enterprise server 2412 containing room information for each conference room in an enterprise, such as meeting room 2401. The enterprise meeting application 2600 can download an entire record for each room, or only a portion of the room record. The enterprise room file is saved on the memory of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403. The enterprise room file can be updated regularly by having the enterprise meeting application 2600 query the enterprise server 2412 for updates or by having the enterprise server 2412 push updates to the enterprise meeting application 2600. For example, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can download a record for meeting room 2401 containing the meeting room name (e.g., âRoom A113â), beacon ID of beacon 2404 located within meeting room 2401, and network addresses of meeting room devices located within meeting room 2401, such as the network address of the presentation gateway 2401. After determining the location of the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 within meeting room 2401 and selecting the beacon 2404 associated with the location as discussed above in step 2916, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can query the locally stored enterprise room file to retrieve the meeting room device network addresses associated with the selected beacon in step 2920.
Next, in step 2922, the enterprise server 2412 may determine whether user authentication is required. As discussed above, the enterprise server 2412 may store access rights information for each meeting room that identifies a list of users that have access rights to use the room and its resources, as well as the scope of the access rights. For example, meeting room 2401 may be a general conference room with access rights that allows any user to access its resources, and as such authentication is not required. In another embodiment, access rights can specify that the meeting room 2401 may only be used by a list of certain users. In yet another embodiment, room access rights can give certain rights to authenticated users and limited rights to unauthenticated users. For example, an authenticated user can use any available resources located within the meeting room 2401. An unauthenticated user can, for example, only receive shared presentation content from the presentation gateway, but not transmit presentation content. In another embodiment, a user may have limited or no access to certain areas or resources based on time of day, priority, employment level or a myriad of other factors.
In another embodiment, a scheduled meeting event of the room for a particular time period (e.g., meeting schedule 800 shown in FIG. 8) may list users participating in the meeting, identifying whether the user is the meeting organizer or a meeting attendee. Access rights may permit only the meeting organizer to transmit presentation content to the presentation gateway during the scheduled period of time. Access rights may permit only the meeting attendees listed in the meeting schedule to retrieve the presentation content on their portable electronic devices. Accordingly, the enterprise server 2412 allows for controlling which user can present presentation content and receive presentation content, eliminating inadvertent sharing of confidential material.
If authentication is required, the enterprise meeting application 2600 communicates with the enterprise server 2412 to authenticate the user in step 2924. In one embodiment, the user is authenticated by having the enterprise meeting application 2600 automatically transmit to the enterprise server 2412 authentication information of the user, such as the user ID, the portable electronic device ID, or the like. In another embodiment, the user is prompted to input authentication information, such as a user ID, a password, a biometric indicator, such as a fingerprint, or the like. In one embodiment, the user registration engine 206 of the enterprise meeting application 2600 handles user authentication. The enterprise server 2412 may compare the received authentication information to a list of users which have room access. In another embodiment, a user can be authenticated against a corporate directory using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). LDAP is a directory service protocol implemented on a layer above the TCP/IP stack used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories.
If in step 2926 the enterprise server 2412 determines that authentication is unsuccessful, the enterprise server 2412 sends an error message 2929 to the portable electronic device 2402, 2403. If the authentication is successful, the enterprise server 2412 can transmit a data file containing the permitted access rights for the user to the enterprise meeting application 2600 of the portable communication device 2402, 2403. Particularly, the data file containing the access rights can be transmitted to the access data storage area 220 and used by the access engine 216 of the enterprise meeting application 2600, as described above with reference to FIG. 4. Access engine 216 can use the access rights to restrict communication between the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 and the presentation gateway according to the received access rights.
If the user is successfully authenticated, or if authentication is not required, in step 2930, the enterprise server 2412 transmits the identified meeting room device network address to the portable electronic device 2402, 2403, and the enterprise meeting application 2600 uses the meeting room device network address to pair the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 with the corresponding meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2010. In step 2933, the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 communicates with the meeting room device, such as the presentation gateway 2410, via local area network 2408. For example, the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can transmit the presentation content 2414 to the paired presentation gateway 2410, and the attendee portable electronic device 2403 can receive presentation content from the paired presentation gateway 2410.
In yet another embodiment, the beacon 2404 can transmit to the user's portable electronic device 2402, 2403 the application identifier 2501, the beacon ID 2502, and the meeting room device network address 2503. The enterprise meeting application 2600 can operate in an authenticated mode or unauthenticated mode. In an unauthenticated mode, wherein a user may not be registered with the enterprise server 2412, or who does not choose to get authenticated, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can provide limited predefined access rights to the presentation gateway 2410, as well as other resources in the room. In an authenticated mode, a user registered with the enterprise server 2412 can use the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 to get additional features and information according with the user's access rights.
According to an aspect of the embodiments, after a portable electronic device 2402, 2403 is successfully paired with a meeting room device, such as a presentation gateway 2410, within meeting room 2401, the enterprise application 2600 relates that information to the scheduling application 20. If the status indicator for the meeting room 2401 is vacant for a particular time period subsequent to pairing, the scheduling application 20 can designate the status indicator for the meeting room 2401 as âbookedâ for the particular time period and communicate the status indicator to the scheduling server 15. The time period may begin as soon as the portable electronic device 2402, 2403 is paired with a meeting room device and can last for a predetermined amount of time, such as thirty minutes. In another embodiment, the user can be prompted to indicate the length of the time period the user wishes to use the meeting room 2401. As shown in FIG. 7, the scheduling application 20 may illustrate the status indicator 706 as a selectable icon that color codes the time period to indicate to other enterprise users that the time period is booked. Thereby, the enterprise user may remain using the room uninterrupted.
After successful pairing, the presentation application 2601 of the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can transmit the presentation content 2414 to the presentation gateway 2410 for displaying via meeting room display 2406 and sharing with the attendee portable electronic device 2403. According to various aspects, the originating presentation content 2414 can comprise a slideshow, such as a PowerPointÂ® slideshow, ExcelÂ®, Word, and PDF documents, a series of images or photographs, or the like. The presentation content 2414 can further comprise audio accompanying the visual presentation or slideshow. The presentation content 2414 can be opened and displayed within a window of the presentation application 2601 on a display screen of the presenter portable electronic device 2402. The presenter can view the presentation content 2414 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 and navigate through the presentation content 2414 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 using the presentation application 2601. The presentation content 2414 can be continuously transmitted to the presentation gateway 2410 via the local area network 2408 while the presenter navigates through the presentation.
The presentation content 2414 can be transmitted to the presentation gateway 2410 as a content data stream, which can include text, graphics, images, photographs, video, audio, or any combinations thereof. For example, the presentation content 2414 can be transmitted to the presentation gateway 2410 as a video data stream, or as an audiovisual data stream when audio accompanies the presentation content 2414. In another embodiment, the presentation content 2414 can be transmitted to the presentation gateway 2410 as a series of images.
In another embodiment, the presentation application 2601 can share the presentation content 2414 via desktop sharing techniques known in the art. The presentation content 2414 can be rendered within a window of the presentation application 2601 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402. Content data stream containing packets of information can be sent from the presenter portable electronic device 2402 to the presentation gateway 2410 as encrypted data that renders what is being displayed within the window of the presentation application 2601 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 at any given time. Conveniently, only the window rendering the presentation content 2414 within the presentation application 2601 is being shared with the presentation gateway 2410. Other data or information that may be displayed on the display screen of the presenter portable electronic device 2402 is not shared. As such, the presenter may perform other tasks, such as taking notes or previewing other slides in the deck. The content data stream can comprise various formats, including image files (JPEGs and GIFs), or individual pixels assigned to a particular X and Y coordinates. Desktop sharing techniques can be implemented that only send information updates on the sections of the screen that have changed, minimizing the amount of necessary bandwidth.
The presentation content 2414 can be stored in the memory of the presenter portable electronic device 2402. Upon arriving to the meeting, the presenter can use the presentation application 2601 to retrieve the presentation content 2414 from the memory.
In another embodiment, the presentation application 2601 of the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can retrieve the presentation content 2414 automatically from the user's calendar upon arriving at the meeting. The presentation application 2601 can communicate with a local calendar utility or application available on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 to retrieve the user's calendar information. Alternatively, the presentation application 2601 can communicate via a web-based calendaring application with a remote calendar server 2416 to access user's calendar information. User's calendar can be linked to the presentation application 2601 during its setup or registration process. The presenter can create a meeting event for a particular scheduled period of time and attach the presentation content 2414 to the meeting event. The presentation content 2414 is saved in association with the meeting event either on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 or on the calendar server 2416. Upon arriving to the meeting room 2401 during the scheduled period of time, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can pair the presenter portable electronic device 2402 with the presentation gateway 2410 to commence the meeting. The presentation application 2601 can access the meeting event on the user's calendar based on the date and time of day. The presentation application 2601 can scan the attached files field of the calendar meeting event using a predetermined regular expression (REGEX) search pattern string to determine if there is any content or files attached to the meeting event. The presentation application 2601 can present to the user a list of potential content found in association with the meeting event. As such, the presentation application 2601 can retrieve the appropriate presentation content 2414 associated with the meeting event in the user's calendar based on the date and time of day and present the presentation content 2414 to the user.
In another embodiment, the presentation application 2601 of the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can retrieve the presentation content 2414 automatically via the enterprise server 2412 upon arriving at the meeting. The presenter can create a meeting event by scheduling a meeting and booking the meeting room 2401 via the scheduling application 20 of the enterprise meeting application 2600 and the enterprise server 2412, as discussed above, and upload a presentation containing the presentation content 2414 as a shared document 1201 (FIG. 12). The presentation content 2414 can be saved in association with the scheduled meeting event on the enterprise server 2412. The presentation application 2601 can be a standalone application in communication with the scheduling application 20, or both applications can comprise modules of the enterprise meeting application 2600. Upon arriving at meeting room 2401 where the meeting is to be held and placing the presenter portable electronic device 2402 within a communication range of beacon 2404, the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can pair with the presentation gateway 2410 via the beacon 2404 as discussed above. The presentation application 2601 can access the meeting event from the enterprise server 2412 and retrieve the presentation content 2414 associated with the meeting event. For example, upon arriving at the meeting, the scheduling application 20 of the presenter portable electronic device 2402 can display the pop-up screen 900 shown in FIG. 9 detailing the information for the meeting scheduled in the meeting room 2401. The presenter can press the âstart meetingâ selectable icon 901 to begin the meeting. Upon receiving a selection of the start meeting button 901, the presentation application 2601 can retrieve the presentation content 2414 from the enterprise server 2412 and transmit it to the presentation gateway 2410.
In other embodiments, presentation content 2414 can be provided to the presentation gateway 2415 from other devices. The presentation content 2414 can be provided to the presentation gateway 2415 via a dedicated computer located within meeting room 2401. The presenter can upload presentation content 2414 to such a computer via a USB or other memory. The dedicated computer may be connected to the presentation gateway 2410 in a plurality of ways, including a wireline connection, such as high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), or Video Graphics Array (VGA) connection, or via a wired or wireless local area network 2408.
The presentation gateway 2410 receives the presentation content 2414, processes it, and transmits it to meeting room display 2406 and any connected attendee portable communication devices 2403. FIG. 30 is a block diagram depicting the presentation gateway 2410 in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The presentation gateway 2410 can comprise one or more interfaces for transmitting and receiving information, such as the presentation content 2414, including a wireless network interface 3002, an audiovisual interface 3004, and a communication network interface 3006.

In one embodiment, communication network interface 3006 may include the capability to connect directly with the WAN communication network 2417 via a WAN interface. The WAN interface may permit connection to a cellular data network, such as the EDGE network or other 3G network. The network interface 3006 may include a LAN interface to an Ethernet-based network wherein connection to the communication network 2417 may involve communication through a network router or other intermediary device. Presentation gateway 2410 can also connect to the communication network 2417 via the wireless network interface 3002, through the wireless LAN 2408 and one or more intermediary device. Presentation gateway 2410 can communicate with one or more remote servers, such as the enterprise server 2412, the calendar server 2410, or other remote server via the communication network interface 3006.
The presentation gateway 2410 can communication with the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 through the wireless local area network 2408 via wireless network interface 3002. According to one embodiment, the wireless network interface 3002 can comprise a bidirectional radio frequency (RF) transceiver designed to enable communications with the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 via the wireless local area network 2408. In certain embodiments, the wireless network interface 3002 may include a PAN interface. The PAN interface may provide capabilities to network with, for example, a BluetoothÂ® network, an IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., ZigBee) network, or an ultra-wideband network (UWB). As should be appreciated, the networks accessed by the PAN interface of the wireless network interface 3002 can, but do not necessarily, represent low power, low rate, low bandwidth, or close range wireless connections. The wireless network interface 3002 can permit one electronic device to connect to another electronic device via an ad-hoc or peer-to-peer connection. The presentation gateway 2410 can use one or more gateways to communicate with the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 and support additional devices. In addition, wireless expanders can be added wherever needed to extend the wireless network 2408 by filling-in gaps between devices.
The presentation gateway 2410 can further include a wired audiovisual interface 3004 configured for transmitting audiovisual information, such as the presentation content 2414, to the meeting room display 2406. Audiovisual interface 3004 can comprise one or more audiovisual outputs, including but not limited to a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), Video Graphics Array (VGA), or similar outputs. In another embodiment, presentation gateway 2410 transmits the presentation content 2414 to the meeting room display 2406 through the wireless network 2408 via the wireless network interface 3002.
The presentation gateway 2410 may include additional input/output (I/O) interfaces for connection with other electronic devices. One or more I/O interfaces may represent a serial port, for example a COM port or a USB port. Additionally, one or more IR interfaces may enable the presentation gateway 2410 to receive control signals from a remote control.
The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise at least one central processing unit (CPU) 3008. The CPU 3008 can represent one or more microprocessors, and the microprocessors can be âgeneral purposeâ microprocessors, a combination of general and special purpose microprocessors, or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Additionally or alternatively, the CPU 3008 can include one or more reduced instruction set (RISC) processors, video processors, or related chip sets. The CPU 3008 can provide processing capability to execute an operating system, run various applications, and/or provide processing for one or more of the techniques and functions described herein. Applications that can run on the presentation gateway 2410 can include, for example, software for wirelessly pairing with the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403 via local area network 2408 and software for processing the presentation content 2414.
In an embodiment, the presentation gateway 2410 includes a main memory 3010 and nonvolatile memory 3012. Main memory 3010 can be communicably coupled to the CPU 3008, which can store data and executable code. The main memory 3010 can represent volatile memory such as random-access memory (RAM), but can also include nonvolatile memory, such as read-only memory (ROM) or Flash memory. In buffering or caching data related to operations of the CPU 121, the main memory 3010 can store data associated with applications running on the presentation gateway 2410. The nonvolatile memory 3012 can represent any suitable nonvolatile storage medium, such as a hard disk drive or nonvolatile memory, such as Flash memory. Being well-suited to long-term storage, the nonvolatile storage 3012 can store data files, software for implementing the functions on the presentation gateway 2410.
The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 3014 for converting presentation content 2414 from analog to digital. For example, the presentation content 2414 may be received from an analog audiovisual input channel, such as a VGA input, from a dedicated computer via a VGA input. The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 3016 for converting presentation content 2414 from digital to analog. For example, the presentation content 2414 may need to be outputted to an analog audiovisual output channel, such as a red-green-blue-horizontal sync-vertical sync (RGBHV) output port configured for transmitting an analog component video signal to a meeting room display 2406. The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise a video processor 3020 for processing video, such as for scaling the video. The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise an audio processor 3022 for processing audio of the presentation content 2414, such as for equalizing the audio level. The presentation gateway 2410 can further comprise one or more modules for capturing images of the presentation content 2414 for sharing with the attendee portable electronic device 2403.
As discussed above, the presentation gateway 2410 receives the presentation content 2414 from the presenter portable electronic device 2402, a dedicated computer located within meeting room 2401, or via other means, and transmits it to the attendee portable electronic device 2403 as a presentation content data stream in real time. The presentation application 2601 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 in turn processes the presentation content 2414 and displays it to the user.
 FIG. 31 illustrates a flowchart 3100 showing a method for capturing and displaying the presentation content 2414 by the presentation application 2601 of the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403. The captured presentation content 2414 is displayed on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 without the attendee portable electronic device 2403 having a copy of the software used to make the presentation. The captured presentation content 2414 is displayed on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 in real time and in sync with the presentation content 2414 displayed on the meeting room display 2406. The presentation application 2601 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 captures and compares each newly captured image to the previously captured image so that only images with changed presentation content 2414 are displayed and saved, while retransmission of newly captured images with substantially identical presentation content 2414 are discarded. This allows for saving the entirety of a meeting's slide deck without redundant images, reducing clutter and storage needs.
The method depicted in FIG. 31 can be performed by the various engines shown in FIG. 26 of the presentation application 2601. Particularly, in step 3102, the presentation application 2601 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 receives the presentation content 2414 from the presentation gateway 2410 as a presentation content data stream. In one embodiment, the presentation content data stream can comprise a video stream. In another embodiment, the presentation content data stream can comprise a series of images transmitted to the attendee portable electronic device 2403 in real time.
In step 3104, the presentation application 2601 retrieves a new image from the presentation content data stream. For example, a new image may be retrieved from a data stream comprising a series of images. In another embodiment, a new image may be captured from a video stream. In various embodiments, the retrieved presentation content images can comprise one or more of a JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, BMP, or other image file types known in the art or later discovered. According to an embodiment, new images of the presentation content 2414 are retrieved in rapid succession. The presentation application 2601 may be configured to retrieve a new image within less than 5 seconds, as frequently as every 1 or 2 seconds, or even less than 1 second.
In step 3106, the presentation application 2601 compares the newly retrieved image to a previously saved image to determine whether the new image is substantially identical to the previously saved image. There are various computer vision image processing techniques that may be implemented to perform image comparison, including keypoint matching, histogram matching, or the like. Images are not substantially identical when content in the image has been changed, added, or deleted. For example, the presentation presented on the meeting room display 2406 may have been navigated to the next slide, or content within a slide may have been altered, such by an addition, removal, or manipulation of text, graphics, images, or the like.
If the newly retrieved image is substantially identical to a previously saved image, then the new image is discarded in step 3108. The presentation application 2601 then waits a predetermined period of time in step 3114, such as a few seconds or less as discussed above. If in step 3116, additional presentation content data stream is available then the presentation application 2601 retrieves a new image in step 3104.
If, instead, the presentation application 2601 determines in step 3106 that the image is not substantially identical to the previously saved image, then the new image is saved in step 3110. The newly saved image is saved to be compared to the subsequently received images. The newly saved image is also transmitted to a display screen of the attendee portable electronic device 2403 for display to the attendee in step 3112. Accordingly, as soon as the presentation content 2414 changes on the meeting room display 2406 in room 2410 during the meeting, a new image of the presentation content 2414 is saved and is displayed on the display screen of the attendee portable electronic device 2403. As such, a meeting attendee can view the presentation content 2414 on his portable electronic device 2403 substantially in synch with the presented presentation on the meeting room display 2406 during the meeting.
The presentation application 2601 continues to retrieve and compare images until it no longer receives the presentation content data stream in step 3116. For example, the presentation application 2601 ceases to receive presentation content upon being disconnected from the presentation gateway 2410, or upon receiving an indication from the presentation gateway 2410 that the presentation has ended.
Finally, after the meeting has ended, the presentation application 2601 can compile the saved images in step 3118 into a compiled presentation data file. For example, the presentation application 2601 can compile the saved images into a slideshow. The presentation application 2601 can automatically store the compiled presentation data file on the attendee portable electronic device 2403, or it can query the user whether to store or discard the compiled presentation data file. The compiled presentation data file can be shared as the user desires. For example, it can be shared via electronic mail in an attachment. The presentation application 2601 can also transmit the compiled presentation data file to be stored remotely. The presentation application 2601 can further communicate with the user's calendar, which can be a local calendar application or a calendar application provided via the calendar server 2416, and store the compiled presentation data file in association with the attendee's calendar meeting entry. The attendee can access the calendar meeting entry thereafter to review the compiled presentation data file.
In another embodiment, a meeting event can be created and booked for meeting room 2401 via the scheduling application 20 of the enterprise meeting application 2600. At the end of the scheduled meeting event, the compiled presentation data file can be transmitted to the enterprise server 2412 and saved in association with the scheduled meeting event. Meeting attendees can thereafter access the scheduled meeting event to review the presentation content displayed during the meeting.
According to another aspect of the embodiments, instead of automatically saving images for a total record of the presentation, the attendee can interact with the presentation application 2601 to select and bookmark the images of the presentation content 2414 which should be saved on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 for later retrieval. For example, the attendee can bookmark the images by touching the images, touching an icon on the images, or the like. The bookmarked images can be compiled at the end of the meeting, for example, into a slideshow.
In another embodiment, some or all of the method steps illustrated in FIG. 31 can be performed by the presentation gateway 2410. In step 3102, the presentation gateway 2410 can receive the presentation content 2414 from the presenter portable electronic device 2402, a dedicated computer located within meeting room 2401, or via other means as a presentation content data stream in step 3102. The presentation gateway 2410 can retrieve a new image in step 3104 and compare the newly retrieved image to a previously saved image in step 3106. Substantially identical image is discarded in step 3108, while an image which is not substantially identical to the previously saved image (i.e., an image with changed content) is saved in step 3110. The newly saved image is saved to be compared to the subsequently received images. In step 3112, the newly saved image is transmitted to the presentation application 2601 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403 for display to the attendee. Following steps 3104 through 3116, the presentation gateway 2410 captures and compares each newly captured image to the previously captured image so that only images with changed presentation content 2414 are transmitted to the attendee portable electronic device 2403, and that newly captured images with substantially identical presentation content 2414 are discarded. This saves bandwidth and allows for saving the entirety of a meeting's slide deck without redundant images, reducing clutter and storage needs.
After the presentation has ended, the presentation gateway 2410 can discard the saved images, or it can compile the saved images into a compiled presentation data file in step 3118. The compiled presentation data file can be saved for a predetermined amount of time on the presentation gateway 2410, after which it may be discarded. In another embodiment, at the end of the meeting, the compiled presentation data file can be transmitted to the portable electronic devices 2402, 2403, or to a remote server, such as the enterprise server 2412. For example, a meeting event can be created and booked for meeting room 2401 via the scheduling application 20 of the enterprise meeting application 2600. At the end of the scheduled meeting event, the compiled presentation data file can be transmitted to the enterprise server 2412 and saved in association with the scheduled meeting event. Meeting attendees can thereafter access the scheduled meeting event to review the presentation content displayed during the meeting.

Pressing the âpresentâ icon 3302 will launch the presentation application 2601 to present the presentation content 2414 via the presentation gateway 2410. Alternatively, the user may press the âviewâ icon 3203 to launch the presentation application 2601 to view the presentation content 2414 that is being displayed by the presentation gateway 2410. In another embodiment, the user is authenticated as discussed above and can be identified by the enterprise server 2412 as either the presenter or an attendee of the meeting. If the user is identified as the presenter, the access room page 3300 will display the âpresentâ icon 3302, but not the âviewâ icon 3303. If the user is identified as the attendee, the scheduling page 3300 will display the âviewâ icon 3303, but not the âpresentâ icon 3302.
 FIG. 34A is a schematic diagram depicting a present options page 3400 of the presentation application 2601, which can be accessed after the presenter pressed the âpresentâ icon 3201 (FIG. 32) or 3302 (FIG. 33). The presenter may select presentation content 2414 to present in the presentation content section 3401. The presenter may press the âview file on my deviceâ icon 3402 to brows and select files stored in the memory of the presenter portable electronic device 2402. The presentation application 2601 can further contain a âmeeting event contentâ section 3403 that displays one or more content associated with the meeting event automatically retrieved from the user's calendar or from the enterprise server 2412 as discussed above. For example, for each retrieved content, the presentation application 2601 may display a selectable icon, such as a âslideshowâ icon 3408 and a âPDF fileâ icon 3410. The presenter may select the desired content by pressing its corresponding icon and then pressing the âpresentâ icon 3406. In response, the presentation application 2601 will transmit the selected content to the presentation gateway 2410. The present page 3400 may further contain a presenter selectable attendee viewing option 3412 to enable or disable attendee viewing of the presentation content 2414 on the attendee portable electronic device 2403. If the attendee viewing option 3412 is enabled, then the presentation gateway 2410 transmits the displayed presentation content 2414 to one or more attendee portable electronic device 2403, upon request. If the attendee viewing option 3412 is disabled, the presentation gateway 2410 only transmits the presentation content 2414 to be displayed on the meeting room display 2406 in the room, and not to the attendee portable electronic device 2403.
 FIG. 34B is a schematic diagram depicting a present page 3420 of the presentation application 2601 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402. The present page 3420 can be accessed after the presenter pressed the âpresentâ icon 3406 on the present options page 3400 (FIG. 34A). During the meeting, the presentation application 2601 on the presenter portable electronic device 2402 displays the presentation content to the presenter in synch with the presentation content presented on the meeting room display 2406. The present page 3420 can display the current page 3421 of the presentation content in a presentation content window 3425. Only the window 3425 rendering the presentation content 2414 within the presentation application 2601 is being shared with the presentation gateway 2410 for display on the meeting room display 2406.

The meeting presenter or the attendee can further annotate the presentation during the meeting by pressing the ânotesâ icon 3424 (FIG. 34B) or 3510 (FIG. 35). FIG. 36 is a schematic diagram depicting an annotating page 3600 of the presentation application 2601. The annotating page 3600 can display the current images 3601 of the presentation content 2414, a section with the user's notes 3605, and an on-screen keyboard 3606. The annotating page 3600 allows the presenter or the attendee to take notes 3605 along with viewing the current images 3601 of the presentation content 2414 using a word processing functionality. The word processing functionality can be provided by the word processing engine 2616 of the presentation application 2601 (FIG. 26). The attendee can also scrawl back to previously saved images to add or edit their notes. While the presenter is also provided with the annotating page 3600 to take notes during the presentation, only the current page 3601 of the presentation content 2414, and not the notes, will be transmitted to the presentation gateway 2410 and displayed on the meeting display 2406 during the meeting.
As the user takes notes, the entered notes 3605 are saved in association with their corresponding images of the presentation. The images along with their associated notes can be compiled into a single data file. For example, the notes can be saved in association with their images in a slideshow format, such that each slide contains a saved image and its associated notes. More than one user's notes may be compiled and saved in association with their images. According to one embodiment, each saved image can be recorded in a Powerpoint slide and its associated notes can be added in the notes field of the slide in a Powerpoint XML format (PPTX). In another embodiment, the user's notes can be saved as part of the image or as a separate shape in the PPTX file. In another embodiment, images along with their associated notes can be compiled in a Word XML format (DOCX) where the images and their corresponding notes will be saved on a single page. The compiled presentation data file can be saved on the presenter or attendee portable electronic device 2402, 2403 or shared as discussed above. The compiled presentation data file can further be saved in association with the user's calendar as discussed above.

The functions of the various engines of the conferencing application 3801 are described in greater detail below.
 FIG. 39 is a flowchart 3900 showing the method for initiating a conference call using the conferencing application 3801 on the portable electronic device 3702 via one or more beacons 3704 according to an illustrative embodiment. In step 3902, a user positions the portable electronic device 3702 in communication range with a beacon 3704. The user may position the portable electronic device 3702 by walking within the meeting room 3701 while carrying the portable electronic device 3702.
In step 3904, the user loads the enterprise meeting application 2600, which instructs the portable electronic device 3702 to scan for any nearby beacons 3704. In step 3906, the portable electronic device 3702 pairs with the conferencing endpoint 3710 via one or more beacon 3704 present within meeting room 3701. The pairing can be accomplished using any of the methods described above.
According to one embodiment, system 3700 can comprises a standalone or semi-standalone system which operates without or with minimal interactivity with a central management server, a system processor, such as system processor 40 or 42, or remote servers, such as the enterprise server 2412. Such implementation is useful in a small scale application where the use of a central management is impractical or undesired. The system 3700 can comprise one or more conferencing endpoints 3710 and dedicated beacons 3704 strategically dispersed throughout a building or a floor. Each conferencing endpoint 3710 can be associated with one or more dedicated beacons which store the network address of the conferencing endpoint 3710, such as an IP address, a URI address, a URL address, a host name, or the like. In one embodiment, one or more dedicated beacons are placed within the same meeting room as the conferencing endpoint 3710. In another embodiment, a dedicated beacon can be integrated within the conferencing endpoint 3710. The dedicated beacon 3704 broadcasts an application ID and the network address of the conferencing endpoint 3710. The enterprise meeting application 2600 uses the network address to connect the portable communication device 3702 to the appropriate conferencing endpoint 3710. The user's portable electronic device 3702 can be paired directly with the conferencing endpoint 3710 following the method steps described above with relation to FIG. 27. The enterprise meeting application 2600 can be automatically loaded on the portable electronic device 3702 once the portable electronic device 3702 comes in communication proximity with a beacon 3704 following the steps shown in FIG. 28.
According to another embodiment, conferencing system 3700 can be integrated Into an enterprise-wide system, such as system 100 shown in FIG. 18, and can be connected to the enterprise server 2412, such as scheduling server 15 described above. Conferencing system 3700 may further comprise additional servers, including a calendar server 2416 for receiving a user's calendar information. Calendar server 2416 can be integrated with the enterprise server 2412. Such an implementation is useful in large-scale enterprise control. As discussed above, the enterprise server 2412 stores room information or record associated with each conference room, such as meeting room 3701. In addition to the above information, such room data may include information that the room is equipped with conferencing endpoint 3710, display 3706, speaker 3712, and camera and microphone 3714, as well as the network address of the conferencing endpoint 3710.
In such an implementation, the beacon 3704 may broadcast an application identifier and its beacon ID. Upon identifying the closest beacon, such as beacon 3704, the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the portable electronic device 3702 receives from the beacon 3704 the application identifier and its beacon ID. The enterprise meeting application 2600 receiving the beacon ID would use the beacon ID to identify the network address of the conferencing endpoint 3710 by either querying the enterprise server 2412 or an internally stored enterprise room file, as discussed above. The user's portable electronic device 3702 can be authenticated and paired with the conferencing endpoint 3710 via one or more beacons 3704 and the enterprise server 2412 following the method steps described above with relation to FIG. 29. As discussed above, the enterprise server 2412 may store access rights information for each meeting room that identifies a list of users that have access rights to use the room and its resources, as well as the scope of the access rights. A user may have limited or no access to certain areas or resources based on time of day, priority, employment level or a myriad of other factors. For example, only authenticated users can initiate conference calls using the available resources located within the meeting room 3701 and only during the scheduled meeting time period.
After successful pairing, in step 3908, the conferencing application 3801 of the enterprise meeting application 2600 on the user's portable electronic device 3702 can access a scheduled meeting event on the user's calendar containing conferencing information embedded therein. The conferencing application 3801 can communicate with a local calendar utility or application available on the user's portable electronic device 3702 to access the user's calendar information. Alternatively, the conferencing application 3801 can communicate via a web-based calendaring application with a remote calendar server 2416 to access user's calendar information. User's calendar can be linked to the conferencing application 3801 during its setup or registration process. An example of a calendaring application includes a Microsoft OutlookÂ® calendar application, which can be a standalone application, or can work with a remote calendar server 2416, such as the Microsoft Exchange Server.
The scheduled meeting event on the user's calendar can be a meeting event created by the user or a meeting event received by the user from other users. The user can create a meeting event using the calendaring application ahead of the meeting for a particular scheduled period of time and enter meeting information in the meeting event. The meeting information is entered in various fields of the calendaring application as is known in the art. These fields may include meeting organizer, meeting attendees, subject, title, description, location, date, start time, end time, meeting body, notes, attachment, contacts, conferencing information, or the like. For example, using these fields the user can invite meeting attendees, describe the subject of the meeting, choose date and time of the meeting, list the meeting agenda, and include or attach other meeting information. Additionally, the user can enter conferencing information in the conferencing information field or in any other field of the meeting event, such as the location field or the body field. The conferencing information is saved in association with the meeting event either on the user's portable electronic device 3702 or on the calendar server 2416. Conferencing information may include a conference number and code, such as an audio conference bridge number and passcode; a phone number; an Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or a username of the voice over IP system; a uniform resource locator (URL) for a particular meeting that provides access to a particular meeting via a web server, such as a URL address for Microsoft Lync system; network communication protocols, and Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), or the like. Conferencing information may further include a unique ID for a virtual meeting room (VMR). A virtual meeting room, also called a virtual meeting space, is a service that provides means to collaborate via video or audio-only in real time over the Internet via a web browser or software application hosted on a service provider's server. The virtual meeting room ID is sent by the organizer to meeting attendees to log into the same meeting from various geographical locations.
Upon arriving to the meeting room 3701, the enterprise meeting application 2600 can pair the user's portable electronic device 3702 with the conferencing endpoint 3710 as discussed above. The conferencing application 3801 can access the user's calendar and identify meeting events that have conferencing information embedded in them. The conferencing application 3801 can display on the user's portable electronic device 3702 a list of potential meeting events to call. The user can select an event to dial. In another embodiment, the conferencing application 3801 can automatically select a scheduled meeting event to dial from the user's calendar based on the date and time of day.
After a meeting event is selected, either automatically or manually, in step 3910, the conferencing application 3801 retrieves the conferencing information embedded in the meeting event. The conferencing application 3801 can scan the fields of the calendar meeting event using predetermined regular expression (REGEX) search pattern strings to determine if there is any conferencing information listed in any of the fields. As discussed above, conferencing information can take a number of different forms. For example, the conferencing application 3801 can parse a dialing string from a meeting event body.
In step 3912, the conferencing application 3801 selects conferencing information of a connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint. The conferencing application 3801 may determine the connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint 3710 by identifying the type of conferencing endpoint 3710 it is connected to, for example, by a model or serial number. The connection type or the type of conferencing endpoint 3710 may be communicated by the conferencing endpoint 3710. In another embodiment, the connection type or the type of conferencing endpoint 3710 may be stored in the room record for room 3701, either on the portable electronic device 3702, the enterprise server 2412, or both. If the conferencing information contains more than one connection type, the conferencing application 3801 identifies and selects conferencing information that corresponds with the connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint 3710. If the conferencing information does not contain conferencing information for the connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint 3710, the conferencing application 3801 may display an error message with instructions on how to dial the conference call using the conferencing endpoint 3710 in meeting room 3701.
For example, the conferencing endpoint 3710 may only provide capabilities for standard telephone dialing. The conferencing information retrieved from the scheduled meeting event may contain a Lync URL address, a SIP URI, and a conventional telephone number. Upon identifying that the conferencing endpoint 3710 only contains standard telephone dialing capabilities, the conferencing application 3801 would select the conventional telephone number. These steps may be transparent to the end-user and solve the problem of a non-technical user needing to navigate the multiple connection types that are frequently included in scheduled meeting events.
In another embodiment, if the conferencing endpoint 3710 can support multiple connection types, and the retrieved conferencing information contains conferencing information for multiple connection types, the conferencing application 3801 may select conferencing information of the best connection type. The conferencing application 3801 may select the best connection type based on connection speed. In another embodiment, the conferencing application 3801 may select the best connection type based on a stored ranking table, either a predetermined ranking table or one ranked by the user.
In step 3914, the conferencing application 3801 sends the selected conferencing information to the conferencing endpoint 3710 via the local area network 2408. The conferencing endpoint 3710 receives the conferencing information and uses it to dial the conference call.
It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the steps of the aforementioned method may be performed in a different order and that some steps may be eliminated or substituted. For example, the conferencing application 3801 may identify the connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint 3710 before step 3910. Then in step 3910, the conferencing application 3801 may scan the fields of the calendar meeting event and retrieve only conferencing information of the connection type supported by the conferencing endpoint 3710.

Each item can also display a selectable icon identifying the type of connection mechanism, such as video 4104 or audio 4106, that can be used to dial the meeting. The type of connection mechanism can be determined by identifying the type of conferencing information listed in the meeting event. If no conferencing information is found for a meeting event, such as for item 4108, the meeting event can be listed without a selectable icon. In another embodiment, the user can press the meeting event 4108 to enter conferencing information. When the user selects a conference call the user wishes to dial, the conferencing application 3801 will navigate to the conference call page 4200 in FIG. 42.
 FIG. 42 is a schematic diagram depicting a conference call page 4200 of the conferencing application 3801, which can be accessed after the user selects a meeting to dial in the select meeting to dial page 4100 of FIG. 41. The conferencing application 3801 can display âmeeting subjectâ information 4202 listing the subject of the meeting event accessed by the conferencing application 3801, which can be extracted from the subject field in the meeting event. The conferencing application 3801 can contain call status information 4204. While the conferencing endpoint 3710 is dialing and connecting the conference call, the call status information 4204 can display âDialingâ. When the call is established and during the pendency of the call, the call status information 4204 can display a counter showing in minutes:seconds the time of the call. The call status information 4204 can be communicated to the conferencing application 3801 by the conferencing endpoint 3710.
The conferencing application 3801 can further display a âvolumeâ control 4206 and a âmuteâ control 4208. Pressing these will send commands by the conferencing application 3801 to the conferencing endpoint 3710 to control its volume state. The conferencing application 3801 can further display a call control button 4210. The call control button 4210 will display âDialâ when no call is in progress. Pressing the âdialâ button 4210 will cause the conferencing application 3800 to send the conferencing information of the selected meeting event to the conferencing gateway 3710 to dial and start the conference call. During the pendency of the conference call, the call control button 4210 will display âEnd Callâ. Pressing the âend callâ button 4210 while the call is in progress will send a âhang-upâ command to the conferencing gateway 3710 to end the conference call.
