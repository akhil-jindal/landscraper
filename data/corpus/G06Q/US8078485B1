BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
This disclosure concerns a system and method to identify the performance capability of an organization on a scale of representative capabilities. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance capability level of key assessment areas within the processes of a postal, freight and logistics-related organization.
2. Background Information
Modern businesses operate in an increasingly competitive environment. To survive, postal, freight, and logistics-related businesses must adapt to this environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the global nature of postal, freight, and logistics-related businesses greatly increases the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day-to-day basis.
Despite the need for a business in the postal, freight, and logistics industry to meet the challenges of the global marketplace, it is still often the case that the business lacks clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of its core processes. These shortcomings severely constrain the business, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, it can be very difficult to identify specific processes to which improvements may be made, either because the business itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the business frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.
Even if the postal, freight, and logistics-related business, on its own, could identify one of the many processes that it needs to improve, the business would not necessarily know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether there are any intermediate goals that should be reached along the way. As a result, postal, freight, and logistics-related businesses struggle to meet the demands of the modern marketplace and fail to identify opportunities for margin improvement, category expansion, portfolio optimization, multi-channel execution, selling performance, and to reach other important goals.
Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance capability level of key assessment areas within the processes of an organization.
SUMMARY
A high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model helps businesses, particularly a postal, freight, and logistics business, meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance capability along which the current practices of the business may be located. The HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and capability gaps within business operations. In addition, the HPCA model also helps the business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish levels of capability during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate capability goal. As a result, the business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that reduce inefficiencies and waste. For purposes of clarity and brevity, the term âpostal, freight, and logisticsâ may be used interchangeably with the term âpostal.â Thus, a postal, freight, and logistics business or industry is the same as a postal business or industry.
The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance capability scale dimension. The performance capability scale dimension defines multiple capability levels. The performance capability levels may form a scale of increasing organizational performance capability. One example of such a scale includes a âBasicâ capability level, a âCompetitiveâ capability level, and a âMarket Leadingâ capability level. Each performance capability level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of a business.
Capabilities of a business may be grouped into platforms. For example, the HPCA model may group the capabilities of the postal industry into ten high-level platforms, including a customer interaction platform, enablement platform, asset management platform, information and data management platform, contract management platform, mail operations platform, transportation platform, supplemental services platform, retail operations platform, and enterprise platform. Examples of capabilities within the customer interaction platform, for example, include channel management, product management, pricing, marketing, sales, booking and order management, solutions management, customer service, and invoicing. Platforms may include sub-platforms, as well as capabilities.
The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example, the customer interaction platform includes performance capability criteria for channel management, product management, pricing, marketing, sales, booking and order management, solutions management, customer service, and invoicing key assessment areas at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.
Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 shows a high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model 100. The HPCA model 100 specifies ten high-level platforms, including a customer interaction platform 102, enablement platform 104, asset management platform 106, information and data management platform 108, contract management platform 110, mail operations platform 112, transportation platform 114, supplemental services platform 116, retail operations platform 118, and enterprise platform 120. The HPCA model 100 is not limited to the form shown in FIG. 1. Instead, the HPCA model 100 may be adapted and modified to fill a wide variety of analysis roles. Additional, different, or fewer platforms may be used in other implementations, with each platform defining additional, different, or fewer capabilities. Each platform includes one or more multiple <platform name> capabilities 130.
The HPCA model 100 establishes a multidimensional postal industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels 138, further described below in reference Tables 1-3. The performance levels 138 establish a scale of increasing organizational performance capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ 140 performance capability level, a âCompetitiveâ 142 performance capability level and a âMarket Leadingâ 144 performance capability level. The performance capability levels establish a performance capability scale 146 along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC). The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level 138 based on a capability position 158 along the performance capability scale 146.
The âBasicâ performance capability level 140 specifies âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âCompetitiveâ performance capability level 142 specifies âCompetitiveâ performance assessment criteria, and the âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level 144 specifies âMarket Leadingâ performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model 100 receives input data that specifies a postal industry platform (e.g., a postal industry area) and a postal industry key assessment area for analysis. The HPCA model 100 searches the multidimensional postal industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the postal industry platform and corresponding industry capability within the platform and the postal industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model 100 initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance capability level for the postal industry key assessment area.
Tables 1-3 below provide an explanation of each of the capability levels 140, 142, and 144.



 

 
 



TABLE 1


 


âBasicâ Capability Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a basic level is indicative of a low 


 
level, unclear, undisciplined, or unsophisticated ability 


 
to execute the capability or process in a consistent, traceable, 


 
and repeatable manner. For non-core, low priority, new, or 


 
early adoption of certain process capabilities, a basic level 


 
may be acceptable to the organization or the organization may 


 
not have the resources to expand beyond the basic capability 


 
level. A basic level of mastery often indicates that an 


 
organization is lagging behind its competitors in its ability 


 
to execute the capability.


 








 

 
 



TABLE 2


 


âCompetitiveâ Capability Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a competitive level is indicative 


 
of a conservative ability to execute the capability in a 


 
fairly consistent, traceable, and repeatable manner with 


 
proven techniques, tools and commonly accepted practices 


 
that are readily available and maintained. This capability 


 
mastery may be a strategic decision by the organization 


 
to be a follower or âgood enoughâ operator in many 


 
respects or may be an interim step that organizations aspire 


 
to move beyond to achieve a leading mastery of the


 
given capability. A competitive level of mastery often 


 
indicates that an organization is performing consistently 


 
with its competitors in its ability to execute a capability.


 








 

 
 



TABLE 3


 


âMarket Leadingâ Capability Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a market leading level is indicative 


 
of a highly detailed, clear, and often iterative and 


 
sophisticated ability to execute the capability. The market 


 
leading capability is the recognized and referenced benchmark 


 
of continuous improvement and high performance for a given


 
process capability. The market leading process capability has 


 
been optimized for efficiency and effectiveness, is well 


 
understood, traceable, and consistently executed to the 


 
point of being competitively differentiated or at the top level 


 
of peer to peer comparison.


 





For FIGS. 2-11, the capability under evaluation may be assigned a capability level 138 based on a capability position along the performance capability scale 146 (e.g., the âbasic,â âcompetitive,â or âmarket leadingâ capability level). Performance capability criteria corresponding to the basic 140, competitive 142 and market leading 144 performance levels populate the HPCA model 100. The performance capability criteria capture criteria, characteristics, and/or other features of a capability at a particular capability or performance level 138 for a selected key assessment area. Examples below illustrate performance capability criteria that provide unexpectedly good analysis and benchmarking for postal organizations. The HPCA model 100 performance capability criteria provide a tool for determining where a platform and capability under examination falls along the performance capability scale 146.
For example, business consultants and industrial engineers may interview a business or receive data about the business to determine, measure, or otherwise ascertain the characteristics, criteria, and other features of a particular capability implemented within the business. The consultants and engineers may compare the characteristics of the business to the performance capability criteria in the HPCA model 100 and arrive at a capability level 138 for the capability under examination. In doing so, for example, the consultants and engineers may identify where the capability under examination falls in terms of the capability level for each key assessment area of a capability and determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 146 for the capability under examination. Performance capability criteria may populate the HPCA model 100 in whole or in part. Multiple high performance capability assessment models may be collected and stored with the performance capability criteria for future retrieval and possible modification in a capability detail pool, discussed below.

analyzing root causes rather than implementing 


 
temporary fixes.


 
Piece-embedded sort criteria (e.g., data glyphs) 


 
maximize quality and accuracy of the sorting process 


 
referencing up-to-date address information.


 
Sorting process speed is maximized to achieve 


 
improved customer service while minimizing the 


 
costs associated with sorting the mail.


 
Volume of missorts is small; most missorts are 


 
due to a customer's failure to follow addressing 


 
guidelines.


 
Mail is cleared only when necessary and depends 


 
on the separation volumes and the production schedule; 


 
clearance is performed fully automated in most cases.

change no longer rests solely with leadership.


 
Systems within the organization support, rather than 


 
impede, change.


 
The organization typically has mechanisms in place 


 
in the areas of performance measures, employee 


 
competencies, decision-making, organizational structure, 


 
and communication that allow employees to not only 


 
implement change, but drive it in a way that is consistent 


 
with the organization's reward system and 


 
performance measures.


 
Most individuals neither support nor resist change.


 
Some, but not all individuals are skilled in managing


 
change.


 
Change efforts are generally lengthy and costly.

Criteria:
Ability to Change:


 
The organization has developed an organic 


 
capacity to change 


 
Change is so ingrained into day-to-day behavior 


 
that it is in a sense invisible.


 
This capability and behavior defines the culture 


 
of the organization.


 
Change is often driven from the bottom of the 


 
organization.


 
Employees do not see it as a separate effort, 


 
but as part of their jobs, and as an opportunity 


 
rather than a threat.


 
The organization embraces learning, relies on 


 
self-defined, team-based performance measures, 


 
has high levels of trust between employees and 


 
management, and focus on developing change 


 
competencies in employees.


 
Change typically happens quickly and 


 
with minor disruptions to the organization.

 FIG. 12 shows a multidimensional postal industry performance reference set 1200 (âreference set 1200â) that provides a capability detail pool from which the system described below may obtain benchmarking tables for a postal business. The reference set 1200 includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables (âreference tablesâ), two of which are labeled 1202 and 1204. Each reference table may provide the benchmarking criteria for a specific capability, such as those noted above with respect to FIGS. 2-11.
One dimension of each table may establish the âBasicâ performance capability level 140 specifying âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âCompetitiveâ performance capability level 142 specifying âCompetitiveâ performance assessment criteria, and the âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level 144 specifying âMarket Leadingâ performance assessment criteria. Another dimension of each table may specify one or more key assessment areas (KAAs), several of which are labeled 1206, 1208, and 1210. As noted above, performance capability criteria, e.g., the PCC 1212, populates each key assessment performance reference table to provide benchmark criteria for âBasicâ, âCompetitiveâ, and âMarket Leadingâ characteristics.
The reference set 1200 represents the HPCA model 100. Consistent with the HPCA model 100, the reference set 1200 may organize multiple reference tables into a hierarchical structure defining discrete changes in granularity. In one implementation, the hierarchical structure includes reference tables, sub-platforms, platforms, and models. FIG. 12 labels three sub-platforms 1214, 1216, and 1218. The reference set 1200 may further organize the sub-platforms into platforms, two of which are labeled 1220 and 1222. Platforms aggregate into the HPCA model 100 and corresponding reference set 1200. Additional, different, or fewer levels of granularity may be defined in the HPCA model 100.
The reference set 1200 may dynamically populate the reference tables with the most up-to-date performance capability criteria, for example upon retrieval and presentation by a business analysis consultant. The performance capability criteria may be retrieved from a performance capability criteria database or other information source.
 FIG. 12 also shows an example of a database implementation 1224 of a portion of a reference table. In particular, the database implementation 1224 includes records (e.g., the records 1226, 1228, 1230) that establish each PCC 1212. In the example shown, each record includes a PCC field 1232, a category specifier field 1234, and a KAA specifier field 1236. Other fields may be provided, such as a reference table assignment field or reference set assignment field. The records categorize each PCC into a specific category (e.g., Basic), into a specific KAA, and, optionally, into a specific reference table in a specific reference set for any particular HPCA model.
 FIG. 13 shows a high performance capability assessment system (âsystemâ) 1300. The system 1300 includes a processor 1302 and a memory 1304. Several databases support the operation of the system 1300, including a performance capability database 1306, a performance measured database 1308, a capability detail pool database 1310, and an assessment results database 1326. The system 1300 may include a local display 1312 and input/output interfaces 1317 (e.g., including a keyboard, mouse, microphone, speakers, or other device), and, through the communication interface 1314 and networks 1316, may communicate with remote devices 1318 and remote displays 1320. The networks 1316 may be any combination of external networks (e.g., the Internet) and internal networks (e.g., corporate LANs). The displays 1312 and 1320 may, for example, present performance capability assessment models 1322 that the system 1300 retrieves from the capability detail pool database 1310 for review, modification, and application by process engineers or other individuals. With regard to local, access or access by the remote devices 1318, the system 1300 may include a login processing program 1324 to authenticate and/or authorize access to the system 1300. To that end, the login processing program 1324 may include username/password verification, private/public key encryption, or other validation and data protection capabilities.
In one implementation, the performance capability database 1306 stores performance capability criteria. As will be described in more detail below, the system 1300 may populate performance capability assessment models with performance capability criteria suited to any particular platform (e.g., customer interaction platform 102, enablement platform 104 and asset management platform 106 etc.) and business capability at one or more capability levels across one or more key assessment areas. The performance measured database 1308 may store the determined, measured, or otherwise ascertained characteristics, criteria, and other measured data of a particular key assessment area as representative practice data 1348. The representative practice data 1348 may be obtained through interviews with business consultants and industrial engineers, through online questionnaires, through manual or automated analysis of business data (e.g., year end operating reports), or in other manners. The capability detail pool database 1310 stores the capability detail pool 1200, which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models 1322. The assessment results database 1326 stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.
The system 1300 facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (âmanipulation logicâ) 1346 within the system 1300 creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data 1328 in the memory 1304. The manipulation logic 1346 may establish capability assessment data 1328 in the memory 1304, including a capability assessment data structure 1330 with multiple capability levels (âCLâ) 1332 organized along a capability scale dimension, multiple key assessment areas (âKAAâ) 1334 organized along a key factor dimension, and performance capability criteria (âPCCâ) 1336 that populates the performance capability assessment model 1330. The manipulation logic 1346 may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic 1352 that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, modify existing performance capability assessment models, delete performance capability assessment models, or retrieve performance capability assessment models for review.
In one implementation, the manipulation logic 1346 establishes the capability assessment data structure 1330 to include a multidimensional postal industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ performance capability level, a âCompetitiveâ performance capability level and a âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level.
The capability assessment data 1328 may also include a capability position specifier 1338. The capability position specifier 1338 may record the capability level along the performance capability scale 146, as determined for any particular capability. Thus, the system 1300 may store the capability level in the assessment results database 1326 or elsewhere for future retrieval and review.
In one implementation, the data population logic 1340 may be a data population program executed by the processor 1302 that populates template performance capability assessment models. For example, the data population logic 1340 may include input logic 1350 that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 1340 may include query logic 1345 that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.
In another implementation, for example, the query logic 1345 may receive an input specifying a postal industry area and a postal industry key assessment area with the postal industry area for analysis. The query logic 1345 searches the multidimensional postal industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the postal industry area and the postal industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.
The data population logic 1340 may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 1340 produces populated performance capability assessment structures 1342 that may be stored in the capability detail pool database 1310.
In addition to the analysis process described above, the system 1300 may provide an automated analysis of representative practice data 1348 that identifies relevant performance capability criteria and determines the position on the performance capability scale 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria for the representative practice data 1348. As one example, the system 1300 may implement capability assessment logic 1344 that includes comparison and/or matching logic that analyzes the representative practice data 1348 with respect to performance capability criteria to locate key assessment areas for which the system 1300 can determine capability levels to obtain a resultant performance capability level for each key assessment area.
Furthermore, the capability assessment logic 1344 may determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 146 as the capability position specifier 1338, for a capability under examination given the knowledge of where the key assessment areas corresponding to the capability under examination fall in each capability level. Thus, for example, the capability assessment logic 1344 may determine an overall capability level for a capability corresponding to the capability level for the majority of the key assessment areas, or it may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the performance capability scale 146 for a capability. As another example, the capability assessment logic 1344 may implement an expert system (e.g., based on a neural network trained on prior determinations) that analyzes the determined characteristics with respect to the performance capability criteria and ascertains where the capability under examination falls along the performance capability scale 146 for each of the key assessment areas, or overall on the performance capability scale.
 FIG. 14 shows a flow diagram 1400 for creating performance capability assessment models. The performance capability assessment model creator (e.g., the manipulation logic 1346) establishes a key factor dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1402). The performance capability assessment model creator also establishes a capability scale dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1404). The capability scale dimension may define a scale of increasing organizational capability. For example, the structure creator may create the âBasicâ capability level 140, the âCompetitiveâ capability level 142, and the âMarket Leadingâ capability level 144. The performance capability assessment model creator also populates the performance capability assessment model with performance capability criteria (1406). A capability detail pool 1200 may be formed to hold multiple tailored key assessment performance reference tables (1408). The performance capability assessment model creator may store the populated assessment structure in the capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and analysis (1410).
 FIG. 15 shows a flow diagram 1500 for retrieving and applying performance capability assessment models. A selection of a capability to be analyzed is obtained (1502). In one implementation, the system 1300 receives input data that specifies a postal industry area and a postal industry key assessment area for analysis. For example, the system 1300 may accept input from a business consultant that specifies a capability for analysis. The system 1300 may query the capability detail pool 1200 for a corresponding performance capability assessment model (1504). The corresponding performance capability assessment model may be pre-defined in the capability detail pool 1200, or the data population logic 1230 (or other actor) may populate a performance capability assessment model template that the system 1300 newly creates, or that the system 1300 retrieves from a data store, such as the capability detail pool database 1310.
In another example, the system 1300 searches the multidimensional postal industry performance reference set in the capability detail pool 1200 for a matching key assessment performance reference table based on the input data that specifies a postal industry platform and a postal industry key assessment area. The system 1300 retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table and initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance capability level for the postal industry key assessment area.
The system 1300 obtains representative practice data 1348 for the capability under examination in the specific business under review (1506). For example, a business consultant may interview the business to determine how the business currently executes the capability under review. As another example, a representative from the business may complete a questionnaire, submit business data for analysis and parameter extraction, or otherwise provide the characteristics of their current capability execution. As a further example, the system 1300 may retrieve the representative practice data 1348 from a database of previously obtained representative practice data.
The system 1300 compares the representative practice data 1348 to the performance capability criteria in the performance capability assessment model (1508). For example, a business consultant may use his or her expertise to arrive at a determination of capability level for the business and the capability under examination (1510). Alternatively or additionally, the capability assessment logic 1344 may perform an automated analysis of the assessment results data in the assessment results database 1326 and ascertain the capability level on the performance capability scale 146 (1510). The system 1300 may store the assessment results, including the determined capability level, for future reference in the assessment results database 1326 or other location (1512).
 FIG. 16 shows a flow diagram 1600 for analyzing representative practice data 1348 to determine a postal industry and a postal key assessment area to which the representative practice data applies. The system 1300 receives representative practice data 1348 as input data (1602). The system 1300 may receive the representative practice data 1348 from a database query performed by the query logic 1345 that the query logic executes periodically, when instructed by an operator, and/or automatically against any number of available database sources that store representative practice data 1348. The capability assessment logic 1344 analyzes the representative practice data 1348 to identify performance capability criteria in the capability detail pool 1200 that the capability assessment logic 1344 determines relevant to the representative practice data 1348 (1604). For example, the capability assessment logic 1344 may compare and/or match the content of the representative practice data 1348 with the performance capability criteria using natural language processing (NLP), text string and/or substring matching, by comparing tags linked to the representative practice data 1348 and that specify that any portion of the representative practice data 1348 is applicable to a specific PCC, by querying for a manual classification of the representative practice data 1348 to a PCC, or other matching technique. The capability assessment logic 1344 may score and/or weight a performance capability criteria and compare the score and/or weight to a user specified relevance threshold to rank the relevance of the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1348 (1606). The user may specify particular terms and/or phrases to search and match between the performance capability criteria and the representative practice data 1348, in order to score the performance capability criteria.
The capability assessment logic 1344 may determine, based on the number of performance capability criteria that meet or exceed the relevance threshold, that the capability assessment logic 1344 has identified a sufficient number of performance capability criteria for a specific key assessment area in order to determine a performance capability level for the capability as a whole or any key assessment area within the capability (1608). As one example, where at least 51% of the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area meet or exceed the relevance threshold, the capability assessment logic 1344 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1348. In another example, the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area may be ranked in importance and/or designated as mandatory in order to assess the key assessment area. In the event the capability assessment logic 1344 identifies the mandatory performance capability criteria for a key assessment area the capability assessment logic 1344 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1348.
The capability assessment logic 1344 may apply the performance capability criteria meeting or exceeding the relevance threshold to the representative practice data 1348 to determine whether any particular PCC is met. Accordingly, as the capability assessment logic 1344 analyzes the PCC, the system 1300 tracks the best fit of the representative practice data 1348 to the PCCs in the key assessment performance reference tables. In other words, the system 1300 determines how the representative practice data 1348 meets (or does not meet) each PCC, thereby gaining insight into whether the representative practice data 1348 is indicative of Basic, Competitive, or Market Leading practices.
The system 1300 may also gauge the position on the performance capability scale 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria (1610). The capability assessment logic 1344 may further determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 146 for a capability (1612). The capability assessment logic 1344 may establish that a desired number and/or designated mandatory performance capability criteria for the key assessment areas have been identified as relevant to a capability and sufficient to determine the position on the performance capability scale 146 for the capability. For example, the capability assessment logic 1344 may determine an overall capability level for the capability based on the capability level determined for the majority of the key assessment areas. The capability assessment logic 1344 may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the performance capability scale 146 for the capability. Although selected aspects, features, or components of the implementations are depicted as being stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as computer-executable instructions or performance capability assessment models), all or part of the systems and structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include, for example, secondary storage devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs; a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received at an antenna; or other forms of memory, including ROM or RAM, either currently known or later developed.
Various implementations of the system 1300 may include additional or different components. A processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The processing capability of the system may be distributed among multiple system components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may be implemented in many ways, including data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms. Programs may be combined or split among multiple programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.
The HPCA 100 model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the postal industry. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the HPCA model, including the criteria noted in Tables 4-68 above, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes specific processes to improve, and how to improve the process and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.
