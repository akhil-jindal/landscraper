BACKGROUND
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to the field of intellectual property management, and more particularly to systems and methods for determining the managing intellectual property life cycles.
2. Background of the Invention
The field of intellectual property is vigorously expanding and evolving. Intellectual property has traditionally been defined as trademarks, patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. More and more, theorists are enlarging the concept to include âintellectual capital,â a term becoming well known in the field. For the purposes of this invention, it is intended that the term âintellectual propertyâ (âIPâ) has a broad definition comprising not only the foregoing definitions, but also including technology (e.g. hardware, software, computer programs and systems, training methods, methods of doing business) embodying the intellectual property, as well as the know-how and methods for using the intellectual property.
Corporations and individuals are scrambling as they try to convert intellectual property to revenue or otherwise maximize the value of their intellectual property assets. Some corporations are aggressively licensing their patent portfolios to generate revenue. Others are flexing their intellectual property muscles by enforcing their rights to exclude others from making, using, or selling technology that infringes on their intellectual property rights. Still others are using their intellectual property to gain access to markets that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to enter. Furthermore, intellectual property may also be used defensively by its owner to protect its market share. Moreover, a corporation may donate its intellectual property to increase its public relations and obtain tax benefits.
Creating and leveraging intellectual property to generate revenue has become a priority for many corporations, particularly those with significant intellectual property portfolios. Unfortunately, however, intellectual property management has been done haphazardly by many corporations. Intellectual property typically has been viewed as an asset with a definite, useful life span. For example, once a patent term has expired, the patent is effectively declared useless, or figuratively speaking, dead. No further effort is made to extract further value from it.
Over the years, many companies have struggled with effectively managing the development and exploitation of their intellectual property assets, such as, for example, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. For example, many of them do not file appropriate patent applications and copyright registrations in a timely manner. These problems are often exacerbated in large corporations where the decision making authority for addressing intellectual property-related issues is often splintered and not well-defined. Many such organizations, therefore, perhaps due to their failure to effectively manage and market their intellectual property assets, are foregoing significant value that could otherwise be generated from licensing selling, trading, or donating such assets.
Accordingly, no one has sufficiently managed the life cycle of intellectual property. There are a few systems available which enable corporations or individuals to track a portion of the life cycle or subsets of intellectual property. For example, Aurigin of Mountain View, Calif. markets a system in which patents and patent families can be tracked, such tracking being available for both a corporation's patent portfolio and those of its competitors. Computer Packages Inc. (âCPIâ) of Rockville, Md. is one of several companies that market computer systems (e.g., computer software), typically used by law firms, for docketing domestic and international patent prosecution dates. However, these systems do not fully manage the entire life cycle of intellectual property.
Accordingly, there is a need for an integrated system and method for managing the entire life cycle of intellectual property development, marketing, and maintenance to be used by owners and/or managers of intellectual property. There is a need for an effective method for managing decisions and resources relating to the development and exploitation of intellectual property assets.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Overview
Embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for managing the life cycle of intellectual property (âIPâ), including the development, management, maintenance and marketing of intellectual property. IP may include, without limitation, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, technology, training methods, business methods, know how, and other like assets from which value may be extracted.
According to an embodiment of the present invention, intellectual property management data is stored in at least one data system having at least one database. A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a plurality of data systems, where each of the data systems can have more than one database. For example, a first data system can comprise a patent and trademark application docketing system and be coupled to a second data system. The second data system can comprise a system to store IP inventory data (e.g., trade secret inventory data, copyright inventory data, etc.), project data, contract/agreements data, innovator data, innovation awards data, and other data related to the development, marketing and maintenance of intellectual property assets. As used to describe embodiments of the present invention, the term âcoupledâ encompasses a direct connection, an indirect connection, or a combination thereof. Moreover, two devices that are coupled can engage in direct communications, in indirect communications, or a combination thereof.
Virtual IP packets can be generated using tagging data within the various databases. For example, a virtual IP packet can include an IP data record corresponding to an IP asset and also data records associated with the IP data record (e.g., other IP data records, product data records, computer files, project data records, contract data records, an so forth). For a given product or service, a broad view of the IP associated with a particular packet can be obtained. That broad view can include at least some of the following: the technology embodying the intellectual property, the type or types of IP protection obtained for that technology, a status of the protection (i.e., patent pending, issued, maintenance fees due, etc.), prospective and actual licensees and key licensing terms, financial valuation competitive analysis, enforcement proceedings, and so forth.
The system can provide a reporting structure for phases of the life cycle and reporting capabilities on the interrelationship of the various phases. The system preferably includes components which form the building blocks to create the entire life cycle management system. For example, the IP life cycle may be considered to comprise three phases. The phases may include activities that (1) identify and develop IP, (2) protect and maintain IP, and (3) market IP. Each phase of the life cycle can comprise a plurality of stages.
Identify and Develop Intellectual Property
The steps in managing the life cycle of intellectual property begin with the definition of the life cycle. This life cycle typically begins with the research and development planning cycle. It is during this R&D planning cycle that intellectual property considerations should first be discussed. Innovations should be identified and appropriate protection methodologies chosen to protect those innovations. Throughout the development process, the intellectual property considerations should preferably be iteratively revised in order to stay abreast of the development effort as well as trends in the relevant industries. A by-product of this effort will be a database of technology that can be used as a technology transfer vehicle between various organizations or subsidiaries. Incentives are also vital to the development of intellectual property. Innovation award databases can be integrated into the system of the present invention.
Protect and Maintain Intellectual Property
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there are numerous legal devices available for protecting intellectual property. Patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets are all available to intellectual property owners. Databases for tracking each type of intellectual property are developed and integrated into the identification and development system. Such databases are used primarily by the IP owners (e.g., the business owners). Identification tags are used in order to map innovations to the protection mechanism which may be on a one-to-one basis, but may be on a one-to-multiple or multiple-to-one basis.
The aforementioned databases also are preferably integrated with the legal databases used for docketing and otherwise tracking the protection phase. Critical concepts such as filing dates, issue dates, maintenance fees/annuity due dates, are typically contained within the legal databases, but such dates are essential to the business plan. Mapping to other databases also can be provided.
Market Intellectual Property
A business plan for intellectual property life cycle management preferably includes marketing (e.g., licensing, selling) intellectual property assets for value. The business plan should not be an âafter the factâ occurrence, but rather should be integrated into the identification and development cycle and the protection and maintenance cycle. With the business plan, a business owner can fully realize the potential value of IP. The marketing databases are also tagged so as to enable mapping between the marketing system, the identification/development system, and the protection/maintenance system.
As will be understood by those skilled in the art, marketing not only includes licensing and selling, but also includes the decision not to license or sell (in other words, exercising an owners right to exclude others from making, using, or selling). Accordingly, as part of the marketing system, there can be an enforcement (e.g., litigation) mechanism and a decision tree leading thereto. Marketing can also include cross-licensing, donations, and even abandonment. The marketing system can include a contract database, a license/sales âleadsâ database, a licensing revenue tracking system, competitive intelligence data, and other data.
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of managing decisions and resources relating to the management and leveraging of intellectual property assets.
Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled the art or upon examination of the following detailed description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The detailed description shows the preferred embodiment of the invention by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.
Section 1
The Life Cycle of Intellectual Property
 FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a continuous IP process, which may be considered a life cycle of IP. The life cycle of IP may be broadly defined to include three related phases: (1) the Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase; (2) the Negotiations, License/Sales Initiation, and Contract Development Phase; and (3) the Support and Maintenance Phase.
1.1 The Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase
The first phase relates to various stages that involve the creation of an IP asset. The first phase can comprise four distinct stages of IP management: identification, development, protection, and marketing.
1.1.1 Identification Stage
Various IP assets may be identified during the Identification Stage. For example, an invention may have been conceived, a new brand for a product may have been thought up, a software product may have been envisioned, an idea to solve a problem may have been discovered, a new technology may have been developed, or some other IP may have been created or otherwise be in the process of being created. Identification of the IP may be made through a number of venues. For example, the IP may be submitted by its creator. Furthermore, the IP may be identified by a team of IP miners through an IP audit. In addition, the IP may be an unsolicited submission received from external entities. Potential market opportunities for the IP may also be identified during the identification stage. For example, potential customers of the IP may be identified at this stage of the life cycle. Modifications and improvements to the IP asset may also be identified in view of the potential marketing opportunities.
1.1.2 Development Stage
During the development stage, the new IP identified during the Identification Stage can be developed, if the IP has not been fully developed. For example, a conceived invention may be reduced to practice, and a software product can be tested and debugged during the development stage. Also, during the development stage, marketing sales channels may be developed for the IP. Preferably, the development of the IP and the marketing sales channels are performed concurrently. At this stage, further modifications and improvements to the invention and IP may also be developed in light of potential marketing opportunities.
1.1.3 Protection Stage
In the protection stage, appropriate steps are taken to protect the IP identified and developed in the earlier stages. Protection of the IP may be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, patents may be obtained to protect inventions, trademark registrations may be sought for trademarks and service marks, copyright registrations may be secured for original works of authorship embodied in tangible media of expression, and appropriate procedures may be implemented to safeguard trade secrets. Furthermore, additional protection may be obtained through non-disclosure agreements, âclean roomâ procedures, and other measures.
1.1.4 Marketing Stage
Analyses related to the market for and the competitiveness of the IP may be performed in the Marketing Stage. In addition, financial analyses can be conducted. These analyses may be performed to evaluate the potential of marketing of the IP. For example, the results of the analyses may provide rough estimates of how much commercial value may be derived from the IP. Furthermore, the results may indicate whether the IP can be successfully leveraged in light of the assessed market condition, including how the IP asset may fare with any competition. Moreover, the results may lead to a conclusion that additional financial assistance must be obtained to compete with a number of competitors. By this stage, a number of potential customers of the IP can be identified.
1.2 The Negotiations, License/Sales Initiation, and Contract Development Phase
During the second phase, efforts can be undertaken to derive value from the IP developed during the first phase. For example, the IP may be sold or licensed to the potential customers identified during the first phase. The potential customers may be internal or external entities. Internal entities include other operating units of the company. External entities may include customers, government agencies, and even potential competitors. In addition, value for the IP may be derived through donation. For example, the IP may be donated (e.g., to universities, to other institution of higher learning, to non-profit organizations, to charities, and so forth) and value may be realized through public relations benefits and tax benefits associated with the donation. The second phase may include three IP management stages: negotiations, license/sales initiation, and contract development.
1.2.1 Negotiations Stage
Negotiations can be conducted with various entities. For example, negotiations may be had with government agencies, suppliers, and end users concerning utilization of the IP. Negotiations can also be conducted with potential recipients of IP donations concerning the scope of the IP donation and any collateral agreements, undertakings, and activities.
1.2.2 License/Sales Initiation Stage
Licensing and sales activities can be commenced with internal customers and external customers. For example, an IP asset may be developed that is related to a product or service delivered by a vendor. That vendor can be contacted to inform the vendor of the IP asset and initiate discussions regarding sale of the IP, licensing of the IP, cross-licensing of the IP, and so forth. Likewise, an IP asset may be developed regarding a product or service that is to be delivered. Accordingly, end users of the product or service related to the IP asset can be contacted to initiate sales, licensing and other marketing activities.
1.2.3 Contract Development, Negotiation and Completion Stage
The Contract Development, Negotiation and Completion Stage can include contract development, contract negotiation, and contract completion related tasks. For example, form contracts can be updated and/or particularized for the purposes of contract negotiations with the client. Various drafts of the contract may be tracked for different instances of the negotiations. Approval of draft contract terms can be obtained prior to the initiation of contract negotiations. After contract negotiations have been conducted, a tentative contract can be communicated to appropriate decision makers concerning final approval of the contract. Activities related to the execution of a contract can be tracked and recorded. For example, after a contract is executed, a computer file containing an image of the executed contract can be stored and associated with related data records (e.g., associated with project data records, product data records, IP data records, and so forth). In another embodiment, the contract may include electronic signatures and the electronically-executed contract can be associated with related data records.
1.3 The Support and Maintenance Phase
During the third phase, the IP developed and marketed in the earlier phases may receive continuous support and maintenance. The third phase can include five stages related to support and maintenance of IP: internal reward and recognition, IP protection and policing, relationship management, royalty management, and quality standards management.
1.3.1 Internal Reward and Recognition Programs Stage
During the Internal Reward and Recognition Programs Stage, innovators who have contributed to the development of IP can be rewarded and recognized. The programs can be an effective vehicle to show appreciation to the innovators. Reward and recognition of the innovators may involve a payment in cash or in other forms of compensation. In addition, recognition may be done through publications, award ceremonies, banquets, etc. In addition, the programs can further encourage the innovators to submit additional innovations such as related innovations, improvements, and new innovations. Furthermore, the programs may also stimulate other innovators to come forward with new innovations. Related innovations, improvements, and new innovations may then be the basis for continuing the IP Life Cycle at the Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase and Negotiations and License/Sales Phase.
1.3.2 IP Protection and Policing Stage
During this stage, patent, trademark, copyright, and/or trade secret portfolio management activities can be undertaken, tracked, and monitored. For example, patent maintenance fee payments and decisions can be made. In an embodiment, the likely potential value of a patent prior to payment of a maintenance fee can be estimated and a decision as to whether or not to pay the maintenance fee can be made based at least in part on the likely potential value estimate. When the potential value is less than the maintenance fee, the maintenance fee payment may not be made or the patent can be donated to another entity that may or may not pay the maintenance fee. IP policing activities can also be undertaken, monitored and reported, wherein certain infringers are notified and made to stop such infringing activity. Examples of IP policing activities include identification of products and services that infringe one's IP, and the development of certain strategical approaches to enforce one's IP against the owners of such infringing products and services. Such identifications and developments may lead to additional innovations and improvements to the IP that may be the basis for continuing the IP Life Cycle at the Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase. Additionally, these identifications and developments may be the basis for initiating and negotiating a license or sale of the IP to the infringer.
1.3.3 Relationship Management Stage
The Support and Maintenance Phase can include relationship management activities to manage relationships with entities such as internal corporate entities, internal customers, external corporate entities, external customers, external sales partners, and end users. End users can include product and service end users and IP asset end users. Examples of relationship management activities include contacting the entity to assess any shortcomings in the IP, any new challenges of the entity, and any new thoughts on the IP. Such activities may lead to the generation of new IP to meet such shortcomings and challenges, where such new IP may be the basis for continuing the IP Life Cycle at the Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase and Negotiations and License/Sales Initiation, and Contract Development Phase. Also, such shortcomings, challenges, and thoughts may lead to the identification of other innovations and IP in one's portfolio, which may be the basis for continuing the IP Life Cycle at the Identification, Development, Protection and Marketing Phase and Negotiations and License/Sales Initiation, and Contract Development Phase.
1.3.4 Royalty Management Stage
Royalty management activities can be undertaken and analyzed as part of intellectual property support and maintenance. Audits can be conducted and reviewed to determine whether the licensees are operating within the scope of their licenses and paying the appropriate royalty and/or licensing fees. Other royalty management activities include determining whether any additional support from the IP owner is required to maintain use of the IP or to assist in licensing or selling it to other end users.
1.3.5 Quality Standards Management Stage
The Support and Maintenance Phase can also include activities related to quality standards management. For example, quality standards management activities can include review and analysis of marketing projects to determine how the marketing activities and/or process can be improved. Evaluations of the terms of contracts and/or amount of review generated by entities and personnel associated with the marketing of IP can be conducted. Objective and subjective data can be analyzed to determine whether innovations are being effectively identified, developed and marketed. Examples of other quality standards management activities include ensuring that the products or services meet the quality standards set by the licensor, especially if the licensor's trademark is being affixed to the product or services, and ensuring appropriate IP markings, such as Â©, Â®, â¢, patent pending, patent number are affixed to the product or service.
Section 2
IP Protection Life Cycle
 FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing an IP protection life cycle. The continuous IP process for this IP protection life cycle may include six levels: Innovation Identification (IP Protection Level 0), Innovation Development (IP Protection Level 1), IP Protection Initiation (IP Protection Level 2), IP Protection Pending (IP Protection Level 3), IP Registration (IP Protection Level 4), and IP Maintenance (IP Protection Level 5). Each of these levels of operation can, for example, include data relating to effort spent, time elapsed per level, time elapsed total, IP management activities, and IP management measures. Using a system based, at least in part, on guidelines illustrated in FIG. 2, a person can determine how long certain operations should take and can manage an IP protection life cycle. For example, a data system associated with the IP protection life cycle can be programmed to remind the person about certain operations of the life cycle and to determine how much time and resources will be needed. The following further describes the levels of the IP protection life cycle and sets forth some examples as to effort spent, time elapsed per level, time elapsed total, and activities and measures.
2.1 Innovation Identification (IP Protection Level 0)
The efforts spent at the Innovation Identification Level in one embodiment can be one to two hours per innovation. An innovation may be a product. The time elapsed per level can be one to five days. The total time elapsed including this level may be up to one week. The IP management operations undertaken in this level include the following: internal awareness in education; internal relationship building; identifying protection opportunities; identifying type of protections needed; catalogue and qualify opportunities; notifying to IP marketing unit for marketing; and assigning a business unit IP management team member. The measures operations that can be taken at this level include innovations identified including the number of types and the quality of innovations.
2.2 Innovation Development (IP Protection Level 1)
The efforts spent at the Innovation Development Level can be one to five hours depending on the type of IP involved. The time elapsed during this level can be one to five days, and the total time elapsed up to and including the Innovation Development Level can be one to two weeks. The IP management operations undertaken as part of the Innovation Development Level of the IP protection life cycle can include: further educate innovator on information needed for IP protection; assist innovator in getting the innovation to the point that protection can be obtained for the IP; assist the business unit IP marketing unit with technical understanding; and confirm receipt of an innovation disclosure form. The measures operations that can be a part of the Innovation Development Level include a measurement of the number of disclosures and a measurement of the innovation attributes that are known and catalogued.
2.3 IP Protection Initiation (IP Protection Level 2)
The efforts spent at the IP Protection Initiation Level of the IP protection life cycle in an embodiment can include three to five hours per patent related innovation, three to five hours for trademark innovation and one hour per copyright innovation. The time elapsed during the IP Protection Initiation Level can be three to five months per patent, one to five days per trademark and one to five days per copyright. The total time elapsed up to and including the IP Protection Initiation Level may be four to six months per patent, one to three months per trademark and three to four weeks per copyright. The IP management operations that can be undertaken during the IP Protection Initiation Level can include: access disclosure form; notify the legal department of the business unit IP marketing unit; verify disclosure award received; follow up with innovator and legal department, and file application; Measures include applications filed, quality of applications filed, and cost management of applications filed.
2.4 IP Protection Pending (IP Protection Level 3)
The efforts spent at the IP Protection Pending Level of the IP protection life cycle in an embodiment can include three to five hours per patent related innovation, four to six hours for trademark innovation and one hour per copyright innovation. The time elapsed during the IP Protection Pending Level can be 18 to 24 months per patent, six to 12 months per trademark, and two to three months per copyright. The total time elapsed up to and including the IP Protection Pending Level may be 22 to 30 months per patent, 12 to 18 months per trademark, and three to four months per copyright.
The IP management operations that can be undertaken during the IP registration level include assisting in notifying the innovator that IP protection was obtained such as the issuance of a patent, the issuance of a trademark registration, etc; assisting the innovator in marking the innovation with the IP protection information; assisting the innovator in understanding the extent of the IP protection; and verifying the IP registration. The IP management operations that can be undertaken during the IP Protection Pending Level can include: verifying that a filing award, if any, was received by the innovator; assisting the innovator with issues relating to using the innovation while IP protection is pending; following up with legal personnel regarding the status of the IP protection efforts; and reviewing written documents from the government agency with which the application was filed and assisting in response to those written documents. The measurement operations that can be undertaken at the IP Protection Pending Level include a measurement of proper innovation usage during the IP Protection Pending Level and a measurement of pendency of the IP application.
2.5 IP Registration (IP Protection Level 4)
The efforts spent at the IP Registration Level can be three to five hours per patent, one to two hours per trademark and one hour per copyright. At the IP Registration Level the time elapsed can be one to five days per patent, one to five days per trademark and one to five days for copyright. Up to and including the IP Registration Level the total time elapsed can be two to two-and-a-half years per patent, one to three-and-a-half years per trademark and three to four months per copyright. The registration operation includes assisting in notification to innovation generator; assisting innovator generator in marking innovation with registration information; assisting innovation generator in understanding extent of IP protection; and verifying registration. The measurement operations that can be undertaken at the IP Registration Level include a measurement of the number of registrations obtained such as the number of patents obtained, the number of trademark registrations obtained, etc., a determination that proper markings of intellectual property protection registration have been undertaken and cost management of registration fees.
2.6 IP Maintenance (IP Protection Level 5)
The IP Maintenance Level can require one to two hours of effort. The time elapsed at the IP Maintenance Level can be one day and ongoing. Up to and including the IP Maintenance Level, the total time elapsed can be twenty years per patent, five to ten years per trademark and ten years per copyright. The IP management operations that can be undertaken at the IP Maintenance Level include verifying that the innovator received an IP protection issuance award; recording all relevant IP protection information; internal follow-up; and IP policing. The measurement operations that can be undertaken at the IP Maintenance Level include a measurement of the IP attributes catalogue and cost management of maintenance fees.
Section 3
IP Marketing Life Cycle
 FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing a IP marketing life cycle. The continuous IP process for this IP marketing life cycle may be described as including six levels of operations including Potential Opportunity Identification (IP Marketing Level 0), Initial Research in Progress (IP Marketing Level 1), Awaiting Execution of Pre-Transaction Report (IP Marketing Level 2), Negotiation with External Party in Progress (IP Marketing Level 3), Awaiting Execution Agreement and Transaction Report (IP Marketing Level 4), and Close Deal Maintenance (IP Marketing Level 5). Each of these levels of operations can, for example, include data relating to effort spent, time elapsed per level, time elapsed total, intellectual property management activities, and intellectual property management measures. A system based, at least in part, on the guidelines illustrated in FIG. 3 can allow a person to determine know how long certain operations should take and to effectively manage a IP marketing life cycle. For example, a data system associated with the IP marketing life cycle can be programmed to help the person plan for and allocate resources for the IP marketing life cycle. The following further describes the levels of the IP marketing life cycle and sets forth some examples as to effort spent, time elapsed per level, time elapsed total, activities and measures.
3.1 Potential Opportunity Identification (IP Marketing Level 0)
The efforts spent at the Potential Opportunity Identification Level can be one to five days at the Potential Opportunity Identification Level. The time elapsed can be one to two hours per innovation (or product). The time elapsed during the Potential Opportunity Identification Level can be up to one week. The IP marketing operations of the Potential Opportunity Identification Level of the IP marketing life cycle process include: internal awareness in education; internal relationship building; identifying potential marketing opportunities; cataloging and qualifying potential opportunities; notifying the intellectual property management unit for disclosure purposes; and assigning a team member of the intellectual property marketing unit. The measurement operations undertaken during the Potential Opportunity Identification Level can include a measurement of the innovations (products) identified, a measurement of the quality of innovations (products), and numbers of people identifying innovations (products).
3.2 Initial Research in Progress (IP Marketing Level 1)
The effort spent at the Initial Research in Progress Level of the IP marketing life cycle process can be seven to ten days.

In an embodiment, each of systems 2000, 3000, 3500, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 comprise data systems including instructions to be executed by a processor and data storage (e.g., a portion of data storage of a database 112). Network 50 may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an HTTP network, the Internet, a wireless network, a wired network, or another communications network.
In the preferred embodiment, server 100 includes processor 111, database 112, and memory 120. Server 100 also can be, for example, a plurality of coupled servers. Processor 111 can be, for example, an Intel PentiumÂ® III processor, manufactured by Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. As another example, processor 111 can be an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Server 100 can be, for example, a UNIX server from Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. Memory 120 may be a random access memory (RAM), a dynamic RAM (DRAM), a static RAM (SRAM), a volatile memory, a non-volatile memory, a flash RAM, a cache memory, a hard disk drive, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, a magneto-optical storage device, or a combination thereof.
Memory 120 of server 100 can store IP life cycle management instructions which can comprise instructions to store data, access data, generate user interfaces, generate reports, and perform other functions and operations as described herein. In an embodiment, the IP life cycle instructions can include IP selection instructions 121, trademark protection instructions 122, trade secret protection instructions 123, copyright protection instructions 124, patent protection instructions 125, IP asset management instructions object 126, IP utilization instructions 127, IP donation instructions 128, and IP marketing instructions 129. For example, the IP life cycle instructions 121-129 can be constructed using Object Oriented (OO) development methods.
The data systems and corresponding instructions (e.g., IP selection system 2000 including IP selection instructions 121, trademark protection system 3000 and trademark protection instructions 122, IP asset management system 6000 and IP asset management instructions 126, etc.) can perform functions and operations related to the development, marketing, and maintenance of intellectual property as described herein.
 FIG. 4 shows an embodiment of the present invention in which the functions and operations described herein are performed at least in part by terminal 10, server 100 and database 112. For example, in an embodiment, the intellection property management system illustrated in FIGS. 50-165 can be implemented with at least terminal 10, server 100, and database 112. In such an embodiment, the marketing module illustrated in FIGS. 84-110 can correspond to IP marketing system 9000, which includes IP marketing instructions 129 and data storage of at least a portion of database 112.
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, instructions adapted to be executed by a processor to perform a method are stored on a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium can be a device that stores digital information. For example, a computer-readable medium includes a CD-ROM as is known in the art for storing software. The computer-readable medium is accessed by a processor suitable for executing instructions adapted to be executed. The terms âinstructions adapted to be executedâ and âinstructions to be executedâ are meant to encompass any instructions that are ready to be executed in their present form (e.g., machine code) by a processor, or require further manipulation (e.g., compilation, decryption, or provided with an access code, etc.) to be ready to be executed by a processor.
 FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram showing an embodiment of the system architecture of the present invention. In this embodiment, each of the plurality of data systems correspond to the plurality of data systems illustrated in FIG. 4. In another embodiment, each data system can be a stand alone system, i.e., each of the data systems can include a server having a memory, a processor, and mass storage (e.g., to store data of a database). As is readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the data systems may also be grouped in a number of combinations or permutations. For example, trademark protection system 3000, trade secret protection system 3500, copyright protection system 4000, and patent protection system 5000 may be embodied in one server, and IP marketing system 9000 and IP donation system 8000 may be embodied in a second server.
According to an embodiment of the present invention, innovator 2001 can send submission including an innovation description to IP selection system 2000. For example, innovator 2001 can describe the innovation in an online form that can then be sent to (e.g., saved to, stored on) IP selection system 2000. In another embodiment, innovator 2001 can submit a hard copy of an innovation disclosure form and a user can enter information from the innovation disclosure form into IP selection system 2000. Innovator 2001 also can send a submission that includes a product description (e.g., a description of an article of commerce, a process, a method, an article of manufacture, a system) to IP selection system 2000.
IP selection system 2000 can access information such as IP law information from IP law source 2002 and IP business information from IP business source 2003 to determine whether the submission includes subject matter that can be protected by a trademark via trademark protection system 3000, as a trade secret by trade secret protection system 3500, by a copyright protection system 4000, or by a patent protection system 5000. In an embodiment, information submitted by innovator 2001 can be compared against the IP law information and IP business information to determine which one or more of systems 3000, 3500, 4000, or 5000 can be utilized to potentially obtain intellectual property protection for subject matter of the submission.
In an embodiment, a submission may be capable of multiple forms of intellectual property protection. For example, computer code can be both patentable and copyrightable. An article of manufacture may be protectable by one or more patents and have aspects that can be protected by one or more trademarks and/or trade secrets. When a submission is capable of multiple instances of protection, duplicate data records or information can be created and linked with one set of data records being communicated to a first protection system and a second set of data records being communicated to a second protection system. In another embodiment, when a submission is capable of multiple instances of protection, a single set of data records or information can be created but processed by more than one protection system (e.g., concurrently processed, serially processed, processed in parallel, etc.).
In an embodiment, IP selection system 2000 can communicate subject matter of the submission received from innovator 2001 to patent protection system 5000. Patent protection system 5000 can access information such as patent law information from patent law source 5002 and patent business information from patent business source 5003 to determine whether patent protection should be sought for the subject matter. For example, the patent law information may include examples of patentable subject matter, such as products and methods of doing business, statutory bar date criteria and the like. For example, patent business information may include data concerning areas of technology in which a corporation seeks patent protection. When the subject matter corresponds to a desired technological area or relates to a product having a potential for high business impact, the patent protection process can be initiated for the subject matter. Alternatively, the subject matter may correspond to an area of technology in which the corporation does not want to undertake the expense of obtaining patent protection, and the subject matter can be transferred to trade secret protection system 3500 for potential protection as a trade secret.
In an embodiment, as the subject matter is processed (e.g., tracked, monitored, the subject of generated reports, and so on) by one or more of trademark protection system 3000, trade secret protection system 3500, copyright protection system 4000, and patent protection system 5000, status information concerning the subject matter (e.g., an IP unit, an IP asset) can be sent to IP asset management system 6000. IP asset management system 6000 can include data records corresponding to IP assets, i.e., IP data records. An IP data record can uniquely identify an IP asset and can be associated with other data records relating to intellectual property management (e.g., development, marketing, and maintenance). Thus, an IP data record can indicate whether subject matter is protected by a patent (i.e., is a patent asset), that a patent application is pending, has been copyrighted, and so forth. In an embodiment, as the subject matter is processed by one or more protection systems, the IP management system information is updated (e.g., to indicate a patent has issued, that a trademark application was abandoned, and so on).
IP utilization system 7000 can receive information from IP asset management system 6000 in order to process decisions concerning the leveraging of IP assets. In an embodiment, IP utilization system 7000 can store, access and report information related to decisions to abandon an IP asset (e.g., to forego paying a maintenance fee), donate an IP asset (e.g., to realize a tax advantage), or market an IP asset (e.g., to sell, license, enforce). IP asset management system data records can be updated based at least in part on a decision to abandon an IP asset, a decision to donate an IP asset communicated by IP donation system 8000, or a decision/update regarding marketing of an IP asset communicated by IP marketing system 9000. Also, in an embodiment as illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10, IP enforcement system 6500 can store, access and report information related to maintaining competitive advantages. Similarly, IP trade system 7500 can store, access and report information related to gaining design freedom, gaining access to technology, or fending off an IP enforcement lawsuit.
In an embodiment, IP asset management system 6000 can generate a communication to innovator 2001 regarding an IP asset. For example, a patent award notification can be sent to innovator 2001 after a patent application is filed on subject matter submitted by the innovator, after a patent issues incorporating subject matter submitted by the innovator, and so on. In another embodiment, after an innovator is awarded multiple patents (e.g., five or more), an enhanced award notification can be sent to innovator 2001 to recognize the contributions of the innovator and to further incentivize the innovator to innovate and report innovations. In a further embodiment, various groups in a company may obtain information related to the IP assets. For example, the accounting department may obtain information on the amount of money generated from some or all of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
 FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram showing a specific implementation of an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 6, IP selection system 2000 can include IP selection database 2100. Trademark protection system 3000 can comprise initial trademark system 3100, trademark project system 3200, trademark tracking system 3300, and trademark response system 3400. Trade secret protection system 3500 can include trade secret database 3600. Copyright protection system 4000 can comprise initial copyright system 4100, copyright project system 4200, copyright tracking system 4300, and copyright response system 4400. Similarly, patent protection system 5000 may comprise initial patent system 5100, patent project system 5200, patent tracking system 5300, and patent response system 5400. Furthermore, IP asset management system 6000 may comprise IP asset database 6100. IP utilization system 7000 may comprise potential utilization system 7100, utilization assessment system 7200, and utilization decision system 7300. IP donation system 8000 may comprise donate project system 8100 and donate contract system 8200. IP marketing system 9000 may comprise marketing project system 9100 and marketing contract system 9200. The various systems are described in additional detail as follows.
IP Selection System
IP selection system 2000, in an embodiment, can receive submission descriptions and conduct preliminarily evaluations of subject matter described in the submission descriptions. The subject matter of the submission can relate to, for example, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, trade dress, service marks, software, literary arts, music, movies, inventions, business methods, processes, articles of manufacture, services, and other subject matter related to innovation and/or intellectual property rights. IP selection system 2000 can include an IP selection database 2100 to store data based on information received (e.g., innovator submissions), legal data, and business data.
Innovator 2001 can be a source of innovation. For example, innovator 2001 can produce IP, and the life cycle of that IP can be managed by embodiments of the present invention. Innovator 2001 may be an internal entity. The internal entity may be a person or a collection of persons in one or more business units. For example, the person may be an engineer who is hired to innovate. The business unit may be a technical unit, research and development unit, a marketing department, a legal department, an IP department, a manufacturing facility, and so forth. Innovator 2001 may also be an external entity. The external entity may be a joint-venture partner, a vendor, a supplier, or any other entity that may contribute IP assets that can be acquired and managed by an embodiment of the present invention. An innovator 2001 can also be any entity that wishes and/or agrees to assign its rights to the innovation to a company, corporation, organization, individual and/or entity. Thus, innovator 2001 could be a scientist or someone who produces advertising materials. The innovation may be bought through a strategic acquisition process from others. In short, innovations may come from an internal sources (employees, R&D, etc) or external sources (acquisition, contracts, joint ventures, etc.). Innovator 2001 also can use computer 10 with a GUI to input data into system 100.
In addition to receiving submissions relating to innovations, IP selection system 2000 can receive additional IP information. One of the reasons why many business entities have been unable to manage IP efficiently is that many companies concentrate on the legal aspects of IP protection. Often, companies do not fully appreciate the importance of business information. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, IP selection system 2000 may be used to collect and organize IP information.
IP information may include legal information and business data. Legal information may be received from IP law source 2002, and business data may be received from IP business source 2003. Legal information can include statements of law defining what subject matter is eligible for legal protection, data tables including legal criteria, and other legal data. For example, statements of law may include data based on statutes and regulations that define legal parameters relating to trademarks, trade secret, copyright, patent, and the like as well as legal articles and other publications that do the same. Examples of business data may include the strategic goals of the company's technology development, the company's known competitors, and the demand in the market for the company's technologies. The IP information accessible by IP selection system 2000 can be utilized to analyze submissions by innovators, assist in valuation of IP assets, and prioritize the development of submissions (e.g., technology, subject matter, inventions, and so forth). IP law source 2002 and IP business source 2003 may be internal or external entities.
IP selection system 2000 may also be a data system that provides replies to queries. For example, innovator 2001 can access IP selection system 2000 to determine whether an innovation is eligible of patent protection. Innovator 2001 may access IP selection system 2000 via a network (e.g., a corporate LAN, the Internet), and IP selection system 2000 can send one or more queries to solicit replies from innovator 2001. Based on the answer or answers provided by innovator 2001, IP selection system 2000 can review IP information in IP selection database 2100 to inform innovator 2001 whether an innovation is patent eligible.
Alternatively, innovator 2001 can fill out a form received from IP selection system 2000 (e.g., an offline form that can be sent to IP selection system 2000, a Web browser-based form displayed by a user's computer that is coupled to IP selection system 2000). For example, innovator 2001 may provide answers to a number of questions on the form. Once innovator 2001 has completed answering the questions, innovator 2001 can hit the âenterâ key, and the completed form will be automatically forwarded for analysis and/or review. A person other than innovator 2001, e.g., a person familiar with patent laws, may access IP selection system 2000 to review the completed form. The reviewer may be a patent agent or a patent attorney. The reviewer can then respond to innovator 2001. Alternatively, the IP selection system 2000 can analyze the innovator's answers against established criteria, and forward information to one of trademark protection system 3000, trade secret protection system 3500, copyright protection system 4000, or patent protection system 5000.
An alternative way of identifying innovation for IP protection is to have one or more persons dedicated to mining IP. These persons may be referred to IP miners. The IP miners are preferably those people who have significant experience with IP identification and protection. Suitable candidates for mining patentable innovations include innovators who have obtained at least one patent, former examiners of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patent agents, and patent attorneys.
IP selection system 2000 may further comprise additional information that is designed to help innovators to further develop their innovations. For example, the information may comprise detailed instructions on what the innovator needs to produce and develop from that point forward. Specific examples may include information related to whether an invention has been reduced to practice and whether the innovator has prepared sufficient information to enable someone to make and use the invention. IP selection system 2000 may further include information or examples of technical disclosures of similar technologies.
At IP selection system 2000, each innovation may be reviewed to determine which type or types IP categories are most appropriate. In the preferred embodiment, a priority is given to innovations that have been identified as patent eligible. If an innovation is determined to be patent eligible, information related to the innovation is forwarded to patent protection system 5000. In addition, regardless of patent eligibility, information related to the innovation can also be forwarded to one or more of trademark protection system 3000, trade secret protection system 3500, and copyright protection system 4000 as appropriate.
Trademark Protection System
Information related to innovations that may be protected under trademark laws can be directed to trademark protection system 3000. Trademark protection system 3000 may be used to ensure that applications for trademark registration are filed to protect the innovations. The trademark registration applications can be tracked and processed by a plurality of system such as initial trademark system 3100, trademark project system 3200, trademark tracking system 3300, and trademark response system 3400. Examples of the operations of these systems are described below.

Trademark tracking system 3300 can also be adapted to cross-reference related trademark applications.
Trademark Response System
Trademark response system 3400 can generate responses to office actions, such as draft responses, response templates, response forms, etc. The responses can contain boilerplate passages such as standard paragraphs containing arguments to overcome standard rejections (e.g., boilerplate rejections, common rejections, typical rejections). Trademark response system 3400 can also have links to articles and publications addressing strategies and the state of the law. In addition, trademark response system 3400 can also have links to TMEP, WestLawÂ®, LexisÂ®, DialogÂ® and other online resources. Trademark response system 3400 can be organized to contain responses to office actions in a systematic way with standard arguments to overcome responses and links to articles and other publications addressing strategies and the state of the law. The responses can be retrieved for use in future office actions that have similar rejections or objections.
Trade Secret Protection System
Information related to innovations that may be protected under trade secret laws may be forwarded to trade secret protection system 3500. Protection of innovations under trade secret laws neither requires registration nor involves an application process. Trade secret database 3600 may be used to store information related to protection of innovations as trade secret, trade secret-related IP data records that can identify and inventory trade secrets, etc. The information may comprise identifiers of the trade secret, the steps being taken to protect the innovation as a trade secret, identification of personnel and/or products associated with the trade secret, and so forth.
Copyright Protection System
Information related to innovations that may be protected under copyright laws may be sent to copyright protection system 4000. Copyright protection system 4000 can comprise a plurality of systems such as initial copyright system 4100, copyright project system 4200, copyright tracking system 4300, and copyright response system 4400. Examples of the operations performed by these systems are provided below.
Initial Copyright System
Information related to an innovation for which copyright registrations are desirable may be received from IP selection database 2100. The copyright information may be stored in initial copyright system 4100. A copyright professional familiar with copyright laws and procedures can review the copyright information in initial copyright system 4100. Based on the copyright information, a decision may be made as to whether a copyright registration process should be initiated. If it is determined that a copyright registration should be obtained for the innovation, the copyright information may be provided to copyright project system 4200.
Copyright Project System

Copyright response system 4400 can be organized to contain responses to a copyright registration agency in a systematic way with standard arguments to overcome responses and links to articles and other publications addressing strategies and the state of the law. The responses can be retrieved for use in future correspondences from the agency concerning similar rejections, objections, requirements, or actions.
Patent Protection System
For innovations that are patent eligible, information related to the innovations may be forwarded to patent protection system 5000. Patent protection system 5000 may comprise a plurality of systems such as initial patent system 5100, patent project system 5200, patent tracking system 5300, and patent response system 5400. Examples of the operations of these systems are described below.
In an embodiment, when it is determined that a better scope of protection for an innovation can be achieved by treating the innovation as a trade secret, then information related to the innovation can forwarded to trade secret protection system 3500 for protection of the innovation as a trade secret.
Initial Patent System
Initial patent system 5100 can contain information that helps identify, develop, assess, and evaluate patent eligible innovations. Initial patent system 5100 can determine whether a patent application is to be filed for an innovation in light of the patent law information received from patent law source 5002 and patent-related business information from patent business source 5003. Initial patent system 5100 can generate and send patent-related information (e.g., not enabling, already barred, and already patented) to innovators. Furthermore, initial patent system 5100 may process information from innovators and log/inventory the innovations. Preferably, each innovation submitted is associated with an invention number by initial patent system 5100.
Initial patent system 5100 can receive patent-related information from patent law source 5002 and patent business source 5003 and store such information in a database. The patent-related information may comprise, among other things, statements regarding patent laws, patent regulations, and patent business data. Statements regarding patent laws received from patent law source 5002 can include summaries, synopsis, restatements, and analyses of patent law statutes and regulations. In addition, an electronic version of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure can be coupled to initial patent system 5100. Further, information related to the development of patent laws may be received. Patent protection system 5000 may be adapted to receive information from online service providers, such as LexisÂ® and WestlawÂ®.
Examples of patent business data received from patent business source 5003 may include patent portfolio information of competitors, news related to the company's technologies, information about similar innovations being developed by others, and the like. The development of business method patents in the United States may be an example of information that is received by initial patent system 5100. Patent protection system 5000 may be adapted to receive information from the Internet. For example, patent protection system 5000 may be configured so that it can receive patent information from one or more websites. The patent information may be related to the state of the art of the technologies similar to those being developed.
Patent-related information can further include who the competitors are, and what the competitors are doing. Furthermore, the patent-related information may concern what competing products are in the market and how a particular invention of the company may be improved to compete with those products.
Initial patent system 5100 can determine and/or provide a report whether one or more innovations (e.g., inventions) are to the subject of a patent application. After a determination has been made that a patent application is to be filed, information related to the application can then be transferred to patent project system 5200.
 FIG. 8 shows an illustration of an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment, an initial patent system can perform a method to stimulate and process innovations. Patentability guidelines can be sent to potential inventors (e.g., innovators) (box 5101). For example, such guidelines can be e-mailed or sent by a Web server. Also, patenting process information can be sent to potential inventors (box 5102). Examples of patenting process information include directions for preparing invention disclosures, guidelines with respect to potentially patentable subject matter, and so on. Invention disclosure information can be received from a potential inventor (box 5103) and stored (box 5104). An invention disclosure number can be assigned to the invention disclosure and a corresponding database record can be created (box 5105). In an embodiment, the invention disclosure can be analyzed based on information from the inventor with respect to whether potential invention is new; is an extension of the existing art; is described in a specification; has been described in a printed publication; has been built; has been tested; has been offered for sale; has been sold; has been publicly disclosed; has been used commercially; has been used experimentally; and the date of any of the foregoing, if any; and other information related to patentability (box 5106). It is then determined if there is a potentially high business impact to the invention (e.g., based on inventor submitted information, based on a subject matter expert (SME) opinion, based on a manager's assessment, etc.) (box 5107). When there is a potential high business impact, filing of a provisional patent application can be directed (5108). Whether or not a provisional patent application is filed, it can subsequently be determined (box 5109) if there is a potential of patentability. When there is a potential of patentability, preparation of a regular patent application can be directed (box 5110).
Patent Project System
Patent project system 5200 can store and track information related to patent applications. Patent project system 5200 may be used to schedule, execute, and track the progress of disclosure meetings between innovators and patent professionals. Patent professionals may be patent agents and patent attorneys. Among other things, patent project system 5200 helps ensure that patent applications are filed before a bar date. For example, patent project system 5200 can be adapted to provide a warning or a reminder if a patent application process is not making projected or anticipated progress. For example, an e-mail may be generated to a person responsible for filing the patent application, to a manager of a corporation's patent department, etc.
Patent Tracking System
Patent tracking system 5300 can track the progress of patent applications. For example, patent tracking system 5300 can be used to track deadlines related to response to office actions. Commercial software packages may be used in conjunction with patent tracking system 5300. For example, CPI may be used to track a docket of inventions for which patent applications will be filed or have been filed. Patent tracking system 5300 can also be adapted to cross reference related patent applications. Furthermore, patent tracking system 5300 may be used to generate information disclosure statements that must be filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (âPTOâ).
Patent Response System
Patent response system 5400 can generate responses to office actions such as draft responses, response templates, and response forms. The responses, for example, can include boilerplate passages. The boilerplate passages can comprise standard paragraphs containing arguments to overcome common rejections and/or boilerplate rejections. Patent response system 5400 can be organized to contain responses to office actions in a systematic way. The responses can be retrieved for use in future office actions that recite similar rejections or objections.
IP Asset Management System
After an innovator submission has been processed by one or more of trademark protection system 3000, trade secret protection system 3500, copyright protection system 4000 and patent protection system 5000, the innovator submission (i.e., the innovation) may be considered an IP asset. Information related to the IP asset can be stored in IP asset database 6100 of IP asset management system 6000.
IP asset database 6100 can include a plurality of data records, where each IP asset has a corresponding data record (e.g., an IP data record). An IP data record can store and/or associate information related to the IP asset. For example, if the IP asset is a patent, the information can include the patent number, filing date, inventor or inventors, and other information. Similarly, if the IP asset is a trademark, the information can include, among other data, the trademark registration number, the application filing date, and the claimed date of first use of the mark. In another embodiment of the present invention, IP asset database 6100 can include information for categorizing the IP asset (e.g., categorizing the IP assets according to application types such as parent, child, divisional, continuation, continuation-in-part, categorizing the IP assets by technology, and categorizing the IP assets by other relevant characteristics).
IP asset management system 6000 can include data records related to innovators, IP management personnel, products, innovation award programs, and other data records related to the development, maintenance and marketing of intellectual property assets. For example, an IP data record of an IP asset can include information associating the IP data record with data records that identify the innovators of the IP asset, personnel responsible for IP asset management (e.g., development, maintenance, marketing), products that embody the IP asset, companies that are potential licensees or purchasers of the IP asset, and so forth.
Information in IP asset database 6100 may be provided to IP utilization system 7000. In addition, IP asset management system 6000 can be utilized to conduct follow-up communications with innovator 2001. For example, an innovator 2001 can receive awards when a patent disclosure is submitted, when a patent application is filed, when a patent is issued, and so forth. IP asset management system 6000 can store information and generate reports and forms related to innovator award programs. As another example, IP asset management system 6000 can assist in scheduling and conducting follow-up sessions and communications with an innovator to obtain new innovations from innovator 2001 (e.g., a follow-up innovation related to a prior invention disclosure, a new innovation related to a commercial project, an innovation related to a service and/or product being developed for internal use, and so on).
IP Utilization System
IP utilization system 7000 can comprise a plurality of systems such as potential utilization system 7100, utilization assessment system 7200, and utilization decision system 7300. Examples of the operations of these systems are described below. IP utilization system 7000 can receive information from IP asset management system 6000 to determine and/or generate reports regarding how an IP asset is to be utilized, e.g., abandoned, marketed, and/or donated.
Potential Utilization System
Potential utilization system 7100 can receive information from IP asset management system 6000 such as IP asset utilization information. IP asset utilization information can include reports as to newly-issued; patents newly-registered trademarks and copyrights; newly-filed patent trademark, and copyright applications; updated reports concerning the scope of a patent portfolio; new trade secrets; and so on. The reports can group the IP asset information based on related innovative products or services as well as dates and other criteria. In an embodiment, IP utilization system 7000 can collect information regarding an initial valuation of an IP asset. The initial valuation can be based on an objective standard, a subjective standard, or a combination thereof. An objective standard can be based on how the market is likely to value an IP asset, historical data regarding valuations of similar IP assets, and/or marketing data of comparable IP assets, etc. A subjective standard may be based on perceived value or importance of the IP asset to the company.
In another embodiment of the present invention, potential utilization system 7100 can generate a prioritization assessment of an IP asset. Prioritization of an IP asset may be based at least in part on an initial valuation of an IP. Prioritization can also be based at least in part on a timing factor related to the creation of the IP asset. The timing factor may be a ranking based on whether the IP asset is likely to generate revenue for the company in the near term or whether the IP asset is ahead of its time in terms of revenue generation (e.g., revenue generation from marketing of a commercial embodiment, revenue generation from marketing of the IP asset, etc.). Another factor for prioritization of an IP asset can be a likelihood of the IP asset being commercialized. For example, a prioritization factor can be based at least in part on how likely the IP asset is going to be transformed into a commercial product or service. For example, whether commercialization of the IP asset is going to make immediate profits for the company or whether it is a âshot in the dark.â
Thus, each IP asset in a potential utilization database of potential utilization system 7100 can be associated with a utilization assessment (e.g., based on a valuation, a prioritization). The company may establish a threshold value for determining utilization of an IP asset. An IP asset with a value exceeding the value threshold may be considered to have higher potential for utilization. Conversely, an IP asset with a value not meeting the value threshold may be considered to have little or no potential for utilization.
In another embodiment, potential utilization system 7100 can be a subset of IP asset management system 6000. For example, while IP asset management system 6000 can store and track all patent-related innovations (e.g., patent applications, issued patents, patent disclosures for which applications are being drafted), potential utilization system 7100 can store information and generate reports for realized IP assets such as issued patents, registered trademarks, registered copyrights, and so on.
Utilization Assessment System
Utilization assessment system 7200 can be adapted to receive information from potential utilization system 7100. For example, utilization assessment system 7200 may be configured to retrieve information associated with IP assets with high potential for utilization.
Utilization assessment system 7200 may be adapted to contain links to other resources. For example, a user of utilization assessment system 7200 can link to other resources to assess how the IP assets may be utilized. Preferably, the resources may be linked via the Internet. The resources may include, without limitation, a competitor's websites, the PTO, Lexis, and so on.
The user can input a variety of information into utilization assessment system 7200. The information input are related to the IP assets, including valuation information, competitive product information, patent information, customer information, infringement information. The user may also link to internal databases. Internal databases may include information related to, among other items, the company's core technology and competitive issues.
Utilization Decision System
When assessment with respect to an IP asset is done, information related to the IP asset may be forwarded to utilization decision system 7300. A user could use utilization decision system 7300 to make a number of decisions. The decisions made using utilization decision system 7300 may include: (1) abandoning an IP asset; (2) marketing an IP asset (e.g., whether to license or sell the IP asset, whether to assert an IP asset, whether to cross-license the patent, etc.), and (3) whether to donate the IP asset. In another embodiment, the decisions can include (4) a do-not-market decision because the IP asset provides a competitive advantage, or (5) a do-not-market decision because the IP asset can be used as a defensive asset (e.g., as the basis of a counterclaim when a competitor sues on its patents). In still another embodiment, the decisions could include (6) a decision to enforce the IP assets or (7) a decision to trade the IP asset.
Utilization decision system 7300 can generate a decision and/or reports based at least in part, on information received from utilization assessment system 7200. For example, a utilization decision can be based on a scoring scheme that weighs a variety of factors. In an embodiment, when an IP asset receives an extremely high score from the scoring scheme, the decision may be to market the IP asset. On the other extreme, when an IP asset has a very low score from the scoring scheme, it may be appropriate to abandon the IP asset altogether (e.g., a patent can be abandoned by deciding not to pay a maintenance fee, etc.). When a decision to abandon an IP asset is made, the abandonment decision can be communicated to IP asset management system 6000 to update the appropriate records.
In an embodiment, two ranges of scores can lead to a decision to donate an IP asset or a decision to defer the utilization. For example, there can be two middle range scores, each of which is less than the score that indicates marketing of an IP asset and greater than the score that indicates abandonment of the IP asset. The lesser of the two middle ranges (e.g., just above the abandonment range) can indicate that an IP asset should be donated. For example, the IP asset may have value but not enough value to allocate corporate resources for marketing of the IP asset (e.g., the corporate resources are focused upon higher return opportunities). Accordingly, the IP asset can be donated to generate revenue in the form of a tax benefit or to generate goodwill for the corporation. The greater of the two middle ranges (e.g., just below the marketing range) can indicate that an IP asset may be a candidate for marketing, but at present it does not meet the requirements for establishing a marketing project. Thus, the IP asset can remain an IP asset that may be marketed, but a final decision regarding utilization is deferred for subsequent consideration.
IP Donation System
IP donation system 8000 may comprise a plurality of systems, such as donate project system 8100 and donate contract system 8200. Examples of the operations of these systems are described below.
Donate Project System
When a decision is made to donate an IP asset, information related to the IP asset can be forwarded to donate project system 8100. Donate project system 8100 can include data records of past and/or potential donees of IP asset. Donate project system 8100 can store data and generate reports regarding the donation of an IP asset. For example, donate project system 8100 can generate a report outlining advantages and disadvantages associated with each potential donee, reports regarding prior donations, detailed report regarding donees, and so forth. Potential donees of an IP asset can include universities, government research facilities, not-for-profit organizations, and charitable organizations. When a donate decision has been made, information related to the donation may be forwarded to donate contract system 8200.
Donate Contract System
Donate contract system 8200 comprises information related to generation of a contract to donate an IP asset. For example, when an IP asset is to be donated to a university, donate contract system 8200 can generate form contracts, contract templates, reports regarding the execution of contracts, and so on. After a contract to donate an IP asset is executed, the executed contract can be indexed by information in the donate contract system 8200 so that information about the contract is associated with an IP data record corresponding to the donated IP asset.
Marketing System
After a decision is made that an IP asset should be marketed, information associated with the IP asset can be forwarded to IP marketing system 9000. IP marketing system 9000 may comprise a plurality of systems, such as marketing project system 9100 and marketing contract system 9200. Examples of the operations of these systems are described below.
Marketing Project System
Marketing project system 9100 can store, track and report information related to a project to market an IP asset. For each IP asset to be marketed, a marketing project can be established to define marketing steps and deadlines. In an embodiment, when a marketing project identifies a plurality of customers of an IP asset, after a decision to market to each customer is made, a separate project is created for each IP asset/customer transaction to track and monitor the progress of marketing the IP asset to each customer.
Each marketing project can include, for example, a project data record that identifies the project and associated information such as the IP asset being marketed, potential customers, actual customers, internal personnel associated with the project, project actions, individual action, and so on. For example, FIGS. 182-183 show methods, systems, and modules for marketing an IP asset. In another embodiment, FIGS. 192-193 also show steps and substeps for marketing an IP asset such as task 4âDevelop marketing plan & package, and task 5âSell product. As another example, FIGS. 84-110 show an embodiment of a marketing module of an IP management system.
Marketing Contract System
In an embodiment, when an IP asset is successfully marketed, the marketing effort culminates with the execution of a contract. Marketing contract system 9200 can receive information for marketing project system 9100 to generate and track execution of a contract to market an IP asset. In an embodiment, marketing contract system can generate draft contracts based on contract templates or previously executed contracts. Marketing contract system 9200, in an embodiment, can define, track, and report on the progress of contract execution.
For example, FIGS. 184-186 show methods, systems, and modules for generating a marketing contract with respect to the marketing of an IP asset. In another embodiment, FIGS. 193-194 show steps and substeps for generating a marketing contract with respect to marketing of an IP asset such as: task 6âNegotiate contract; task 7âComplete & approve transaction report; and task 8âExecute contract. As another example, FIGS. 111-150 show an embodiment of a contracts/agreements module of an IP management system.
In an embodiment related to the management of trademarks and trademark-related intellectual property assets (e.g., a trademark application), quality control can be a significant issue. More specifically, for a trademark owner to maintain its rights in a trademark, the trademark owner is responsible for maintaining the consistent use of the trademark, including color, font, spelling and the like. Maintaining consistent use typically involves regularly auditing uses of the mark. Examples of a such auditing include auditing within an organization, contracting to have audits performed, and auditing an external entity. Maintaining consistent use of a trademark can be easier to do when the trademark owner is the one using the mark, as compared to when an external entity is using the trademark. The task of contracting and auditing is more difficult if the trademark owner is allowing many external entities to use the trademark (e.g., as a licensee) for marking products and services, for events the entity sponsors, for representing themselves as sales or service agents, and the like. The difficulty of the task continues to increase if the external entities are spread across a large geographic region, such as a state, country or the world.
For such situations, a stellar trademark owner may be sending out trademark licensee agreements to hundreds, or even thousands, of trademark licenses across a wide geographic area on an annual basis. Getting these contracts sent out in the mail or electronically, signed by the external parties, returned in the mail, sorted and stored for later auditing is typically an arduous process. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 226, and in another embodiment of the present invention, marketing contract system 9200 can include trademark licensing and auditing modules. A trademark licensor can store trademark license terms on an Internet server (box 2260). A trademark licensee (e.g., prospective, current, and so on) can be given the website address to access the trademark license (box 2261). The trademark licensee can access the server (box 2262), read the terms of the trademark license, and click a link to license a trademark (box 2263). The trademark licensee can fill in relevant information in an online form (e.g., name, address, phone number, reason for license, etc.) (box 2264) and click to indicate acceptance (box 2265). The trademark licensee can then download trademark artwork, if desired (box 2266), and trademark licensee data can be sent to the server (box 2267). The trademark licensee data can be sorted and stored (box 2268). In an embodiment, the trademark licensee data can include information for cataloging and/or categorizing registered trademarks (e.g., cataloging trademarks by family, status (e.g., filed, contested, allowed, registered), and/or application type (e.g., continuation, divisional, primary, secondary). The trademark licensor can print out reports on trademark licenses (box 2269) in one of several sorted formats. The trademark licensor can also send out audit requests (box 2270). The audit requests can be sent out automatically periodically, e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually. This contract system can be adapted for patent, copyright, and trade secret as well.

Enforcement of intellectual property rights can include operations that look to maintain a competitive advantage by obtaining an injunction against a competitor, thus stopping such competitor from using, making, selling, copying, or offering to sell such IP asset. For example, enforcement of intellectual property rights can include the initiation of infringement suits such as patent infringement suits, copyright infringement suits, trademark infringement suits, and trade secret infringement suits against competitors.
IP trade system 7500 can perform functions and operations related to trading of intellectual property rights. For an example, in an embodiment, intellectual property rights can be traded to gain access to other intellectual property rights such as the intellectual property rights of a competitor, the intellectual property rights of a partner, the intellectual property rights of a supplier, and the intellectual property rights of a customer. In another embodiment, IP trade system 7500 can perform functions and operations related to defending against intellectual property law suits initiated by competitors. For example, an IP trade system 7500 can track and maintain information about intellectual property assets that may not be used offensively to maintain a competitive advantage, but can be used defensively to assist in defending against in intellectual property lawsuit initiated and maintained by a competitor. In another embodiment, IP trade system 7500 can include information related to obtaining and/or maintaining design freedom of products and services to be developed, implemented and/or marketed. For such examples, the system may sort and identify similar or related IP assets to those being asserted against or into such areas that design freedom is desired. The system could also sort and identify IP assets related to other areas in which each party has product and services that might be infringing or into design freedom.

Section 9
Management of IP MarketingâProject Plans
 FIGS. 189-212 illustrate an embodiment of the present invention that is related to methods and systems to manage the development and marketing (e.g., licensing, sale, leveraging, etc.) of various assets. Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to the management of the developing and marketing intellectual property assets, other embodiments can be used in connection with developing and marketing other assets. Accordingly, the present invention should not be limited to use solely in connection with intellectual property assets. Examples of intellectual property assets (i.e., intellectual property units) include, for example, inventions, ideas, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, data, computer code and software.
It can be readily appreciated that embodiments of the present invention may be used by a variety of different entities ranging from (i) small companies with small or modest intellectual property portfolios to (ii) large corporations having separate groups or related companies to manage the corporation's research and development efforts, managing the corporation's intellectual property assets and managing the intellectual property asset marketing efforts for the corporation. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to uses by entities that have the particular corporate and legal structures of the examples disclosed herein. As used herein: (i) the term âOwnerâ encompasses a corporation (e.g., parent corporation, subsidiary, affiliate, integrated corporation, and so on) that may ultimately own intellectual property assets; (ii) the term âIPMANâ encompasses the group or entity responsible for managing the intellectual property assets of the Owner; and (iii) the term âIPMARKâ encompasses the group or entity responsible for marking the intellectual property assets.
In an embodiment of the present invention, a system, method or process can includes a product identification stage, a development into the marketplace stage, and a contract stage. In the various stages, tasks are identified, tracked, and recorded into a project management software program. In an embodiment, Microsoft ProjectÂ® software can be utilized. However, other project management software and/or application specific software can be employed.
Each task can have an anticipated duration required to complete the task. In addition, relationships between the tasks are defined. Tasks that require a deliverable upon completion are determined, and a list of resources available for allocation to the process can be established and accessed.
 FIGS. 189-190 depict an example of a project template project plan in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The project template plan illustrated in FIGS. 189-190 defines tasks for taking an intellectual property marketing opportunity through an advantageous multi-step process including tasks such as (i) conduct initial research, (ii) conduct market research and analysis, (iii) complete and approve pre-transaction report (PTR), (iv) develop marketing plan and package, (v) sell product, (vi) negotiate contract, (vii) complete and approve transaction report (TR), (viii) execute contract, (ix) set up maintenance plan, and (x) close out project. Each task has a predefined duration, a projected start date, a projected finish data, a predecessor (tasks before), a successor (tasks after), a percentage complete indicator, an indicator related to a deliverable (e.g., a deliverable is required, a deliverable is not expected), and a resources indicator. For example, the duration of predefined tasks can vary from 5 days (e.g., business days, calendar days) to 50 days. As another example, the resources indicator can identify resources required for completion of a task and can include resources such as a product manager, a marketing analyst, a marketing/sales representative, a contract manager, and a project lead.
In an embodiment, after completion of development of a marketing plan and package of a project plan, the project plan can be duplicated for each target customer for the product of the project plan. A separate project plan can then be employed to manage the marketing of the product to each target customer. A project can potentially end at one or more points within a project plan. For example, the complete and approve pre-transaction report task may not be completed is the requisite approval is not secured. Accordingly, execution of the project can jump to the close out project task to complete and record execution of close out tasks.
 FIGS. 191-196 show a more detailed illustration of the project template plan illustrated in FIGS. 189-190. The tasks illustrated in FIGS. 189-190 can have associated subtasks and sub-subtasks (e.g., a parent task can have child tasks and grandchild tasks, a top-level task can have second-level and third-level tasks, etc.) as illustrated in FIGS. 191-196.
To assist in the implementation and completion of the various tasks and sub-tasks, predefined forms can be utilized. In an embodiment, word processing software such as Microsoft WordÂ® can be used to create the forms, and the forms can be linked to a task associated with the form. For example, a first task can include completing a form, a second task can include communicating a completed form, a third task can include evaluating the communicated form, a fourth task can include approving the evaluated form, and a fifth task can include communicating the approved form. By creating forms and linking them to appropriate tasks, the user is provided with access to helpful and/or required resources. Moreover, standardized forms may help maintain consistency and enhance efficiency of the process, method and/or system.
 FIGS. 197-212 show examples of forms that can assist in the completion of tasks. For example, such forms can be GUIs on a computer for instantaneous collection, storage and distribution as an entire form or a portion of a form. For example, as shown in FIG. 191, task 1.2 comprises âConduct & document client interview.â To assist the user in completion of that task and/or management of the task and the process, a client interview questionnaire form illustrated in FIG. 197 can be utilized. The form can be presented to the user (e.g., via a computer display, printed out as a paper form, and so forth), and the user can enter appropriate information. In an embodiment, a system stores the completed form for subsequent access, communication, and evaluation.
 FIG. 198 is an illustration of a form entitled âAssess competitive environment,â which is related to task 2.1 shown in FIG. 191. The âAssess competitive environment checklistâ form illustrated in FIG. 198 can be presented to the user, and the user can enter appropriate information to assist the user in completion of the task and/or management of the task and the process. FIG. 199 is an illustration of a form entitled âAssess internal marketing issues,â which is related to task 2.2 described in FIG. 191.
 FIG. 200 shows an illustration of an embodiment of a form entitled âIntellectual Property Outmarketing Pre-Transaction Report,â which is related to task 3 shown in FIG. 192. The âIntellectual Property Outmarketing Pre-Transaction Reportâ can be used to record information related to the product/project name, the entity requesting the potential transaction, contacts, the intellectual property assets involved, the background of the potential transaction, a financial analysis, a competitive analysis, a status, a timeline, and other related information. The pre-transaction report can advantageously allow one to capture a significant amount of valuable information in a short, simple, concise, easy to read, utilize and approve format.
For task 4.1 (entitled âGather marketing plan detailsâ) of FIG. 192, the form entitled âMarketing Plan Checklistâ illustrated in FIG. 201 can be provided. For task 5.2 (entitled âObtain NDA from customers/sales partnerâ) of FIG. 193, a Nondisclosure Agreement form as depicted in FIGS. 202-205 may be employed.
 FIG. 206-207 shows an embodiment of a license agreement term sheet form, which is related to at least tasks 5.10.3 (entitled âPrepare term sheetâ) and 5.10.4 (entitled âCommunicate term sheet to Contactsâ) shown in FIG. 193. FIGS. 208-210 show an illustration of an embodiment of an âIntellectual Property Outmarketing Transaction Report,â which is related to task 7 (entitled âComplete and approve transaction report (TR)â) shown in FIGS. 193-194. Much of this information can be retrieved electronically from the information stored for the Pretransaction Report.
In an embodiment of the present invention, a user may be a project leader (e.g., a project manager, a marketing representative, a sales representative) who is at least in part responsible for and/or managing a potential transaction to market an intellectual property asset. FIG. 211 is an illustration of a project activity sheet form. In an embodiment, the project activity sheet form can be displayed to a user via a graphical user interface and can be completed by the user by entering text, selecting data from drop-down menus, selecting data from look-up tables, etc. After the user has entered project activity information, the user can save the project activity form and project data is updated based at least in part on the project activity information submitted by the user.
In another embodiment, a project leader can completes a project activity sheet form illustrated in FIG. 211 to initiate a project related to an opportunity to market an intellectual property asset. A project leader can receive a hard copy version of the project activity sheet form, enter information, and forward the project activity sheet form to a project SME (âSubject Matter Expertâ) to request activation of the project to define tasks, timelines, and other project criteria related to the new opportunity. The project activity form may provide the project name (e.g., in a standard format for all projects), a project start date, and assigned project resources. The project activity form may then be returned to the project leader upon activation of the project and may be used on an ongoing basis to submit updated project information to the project SME for input into the project management system. The project leader's responsibility can be to manage the project and to ensure that the project management system is updated with information concerning the project. The project leader may also be required to ensure that a file of deliverables for completed tasks is retained.
To assist a user with prioritizing amongst a plurality of opportunities to market intellectual property assets, embodiments of the present invention may include a system and/or method for opportunity scoring. FIG. 212 shows an embodiment of a method for opportunity scoring. In this embodiment, opportunity scoring permits the user to rate opportunities in a number of predetermined areas such as, for example, market potential, project time frame, projected revenue potential, competitive threat to the user, intangible value, and so on. Each of the areas are then rated on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most favorable score. Many variables may be considered when assigning scores to an area, and the scores may be assigned either analytically or holistically. When a score is assigned analytically, the scorer can rate each of the variables in a given scoring area and average those scores to arrive at the final score in that area. When a score is assigned holistically, the scorer can assign one overall score to the scoring area. The final score for the opportunity can be calculated by adding the scores from the five major scoring areas. A graphical user interface (GUI) may be used to receive this information.
Though there are many other predetermined areas and variables, the following variables are examples of variables that may be considered in connection with each of the major scoring areas:
    Market Potential: product viability, potential customers, competitive products/suppliers, market size and market saturation; Project Time Frame: product ready to market, ownership/patent status, interested customers, deal complexity, anticipated time to sell/negotiate; Projected Revenue Potential: anticipated total revenue from the project (may be one times the value if no strong customers identified or a multiple of the value for each immediate customer); Competitive Threat to the User: this issue involves the determination as to whether the sales give a potential buyer of the IP units a competitive advantage over the user; and Intangible value: this issue involves the determination as to whether the present deal or sale set the stage for future deals, build or foster a relationship with a customer, involve a member of upper management such as an officer, etc. and/or create a public relations opportunity.   
As indicated above, the entire method and/or portions of the method may be tracked and monitored using the project management methods and systems. To assist in the implementation of the method, an individual may be selected to become the project SME. The project SME can be responsible for inputting and updating any information in the project system for one or more active opportunities. In another embodiment, the project SME can be responsible for periodically reviewing reports generated by the project system to redirect resources, select certain opportunities as top priorities, and perform other management responsibilities with respect to the marketing of intellectual property assets.
Thus, from the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that embodiments of the present invention can provide an effective method for managing the development and exploitation of a variety of different assets so that a user can advantageously work toward meeting financial and business goals. In particular, embodiments of the present invention can enable a user to: more effectively allocate resources; better manage its business by actively managing timing of projects (products/deals); better distribute business opportunities among sales and marketing staff; and actively and effectively manage a multitude of opportunities. Those of ordinary skill in the art will, of course, appreciate that various changes in the details, processes, etc. which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by the skilled artisan within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

In an embodiment, the qualitative and/or quantitative rating of intangible value can be based on and/or generated by a plurality of submodules. For example, the plurality of submodules can include module 1051 to provide an assessment regarding future big dollar deal potential, module 1052 regarding an assessment of whether the deal will build a relationship with the customer, module 1053 regarding a corporate officer request/interest assessment, module 1054 regarding an assessment of the public relations opportunity, module 1055 regarding an intangible value rating, and module 1056 regarding an intangible value explanation. In an embodiment, the intangible value score can be qualitative and/or quantitative and can be based on outputs generated by modules 1051-1056.
 FIG. 213 shows total opportunity score determination module 1060. Total opportunity score determination module 1060 can receive subscores from each of market potential module 1010, project timeframe module 1020, projected revenue potential module 1030, competitive threat module 1040, and intangible value module 1050 to generate a total opportunity score. While the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 213 shows a serial progression of assessment, in another embodiment of the present invention, the assessment with respect to the submodules can occur in parallel and/or a mixture of in serial and/or parallel based upon a decision making process established in accordance with the organization of the IP marketing opportunity scoring system. The total opportunity score determination module 1060 can output, in an embodiment, both a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment regarding the total opportunity score of an IP marketing opportunity project.
Section 11
IP Managing Tracking System
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an intellectual property tracking system can manage and track information related to IP, presenting awards to innovators for generating and submitting innovation disclosures and tracking the status of the IP. Moreover, an intellectual property awards system can further incentivize innovators to assist in the process of securing intellectual property legal rights that protect innovations.
An intellectual property awards system can include an intellectual property (âIPâ) awards database. The IP awards database, in an embodiment, can: track the IP awards process; track the participation of employees in the awards program; track the number of innovation disclosures processed during a given year; track the number of intellectual property applications (e.g., patent applications, trademark applications, and so on) filed during a given year; track the number of intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyrights, an so forth) issued during a given year; track disclosure gifts distributed to innovators; track costs associated with the purchase of disclosure gifts; track the disposition of non-employee innovation disclosures; maintain a contact list of IP coordinators for affiliated organizations (e.g., companies, divisions, units, etc.); maintain an electronic document corresponding to participating innovators; and link database tables to produce analysis reports.
In an embodiment, an IP awards database can include a plurality of components including components such as tables, queries, forms and reports. Queries, forms and reports can be based on field properties that are first created in a table. In an embodiment, an IP awards database can include five linked tables: an awards database table; an organization (e.g., company) names table; a disclosure gift table; an inventors (i.e., innovators) table; and an IP coordinator table. The awards database table can store data relative to the incentive and monetary gifts granted to inventors. The organization (e.g., company) names table can store data relative to organizations (e.g., affiliate companies). The disclosure gift table can store data relative to gifts, such as a listing of gifts purchased, quantities, cost, and supplier. The inventors table can store data relative to an inventor such as employee contact information, employee supervisor, employer name and IP coordinator. The IP coordinator table can store data relative to a point of contact on IP matters for inventors and/or organizations.
An IP awards database form can include a plurality of sections such as a vendor (e.g., inventor, innovator) profile, a vendor input, a disclosure award, a filing award, an issuance award, a publication award, an inventor achievement award, and a general award. A vendor profile can store information associated with a particular inventor. For example, when a new record is initially opened, a cursor can default to a field labeled âIdentifierâ. A user can press a drop-down arrow of the Identifier box, and a listing of vendor profiles that are linked to the inventors can be displayed. Each vendor in the database can been assigned a unique identifier number as a participant in the awards program. Once an inventor's name is located, it can be selected. Then, a number can appear in the Identifier box, and the inventor's address information can appear at the top of the screen in the inventor profile section. In an embodiment, the profile section is a viewing mechanism and information cannot be queried or entered. When an inventor is not shown in the Identifier box, his or her profile must be added to the Inventor table before a record can be entered and/or updated in the awards database.
In an embodiment, Table 1 includes a description of the fields in the vendor profile section.

 FIG. 219 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. A vendor (e.g., inventor) disclosure meeting can be conducted with IP and/or legal personnel (box 9551). An innovation can be documented by entering data in an IP awards database (box 9552), and that data can be linked to related tables and/or queries (box 9553) such as one or more of an IP awards database table, an organization names table, a disclosure gift table, an inventors table, and an IP coordinators table (box 9554). The created data records can be saved (box 9555), and disclosure reports and award letters can be generated (box 9556). Disclosure forms based at least in part on the innovation can be forwarded to a legal firm (e.g., a law firm, a legal division of an organization, a patent professional, a trademark professional) (box 9557), and a disclosure award can be sent to the vendor (e.g., inventor) (box 9558). When the legal firm sends a notification (e.g., to IP personnel) that a filing based at least in part on the disclosure form has been made, a filing award for the vendor (e.g., inventor) can be processed (box 9559). When the legal firm sends a notification (e.g., to IP personnel) that an intellectual property right (e.g., a patent, trademark) based at least in part on the disclosure form has been issued, an issuance award for the vendor (e.g., inventor) can be processed (box 9560). Based at least in part on the issuance notification, an IP right record (e.g., a patent record, a trademark record) can be entered in a database (e.g., the IP awards database, a database linked to the IP awards database) (box 9561).
Section 12
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for the development and implementation of intellectual property marketing. A targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need can be developed, and actions can be taken to legally protect the targeted innovation as an intellectual property asset. The intellectual property asset can be analyzed to determine a marketing assessment. Based at least in part on the marketing assessment, a decision can be made as to whether to market the intellectual property asset. When the marketing assessment meets a predetermined threshold, the intellectual property asset can be marketed.
A targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need, in an embodiment, is an innovation (e.g., process, product, system, technology, business method, method of training, expression, name, slogan, and so forth) that is developed to support the core business of an organization without consideration of the use of that innovation outside of the organization. For example, an organization (e.g., company, corporation, firm, university, research institution, and so on) may develop an innovation, e.g., a billing system, a data trafficker, a maintenance protocol, for its core business without consideration at the time of development that an external organization would buy, use, or acquire.
As a further example, a targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need can be an innovation that is developed without any external customer in mind. Thus, a targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need can comprise an innovation developed without instruction for external entities, without help screens, without support plans, without external maintenance support, and/or without plans for external training, marketing, and/or advertising. In a further example, an internal need innovation can be developed without any research and development cost versus revenue assessment. In still another example, an internal need innovation can be developed without any sales or revenue projections. Moreover, developing a targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need can be based at least in part on a determination that acquiring the targeted innovation from an external source is not feasible.
Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present innovation, developing and implementing intellectual property marketing can include developing a targeted innovation to fulfill an internal need. Then, the organization can act to legally protect the targeted innovation as an intellectual property asset. The intellectual property asset can be analyzed to determine a marketing assessment. For example, in an embodiment, a marketing assessment can be an absolute marketing assessment as described in FIG. 212 and the accompanying written description. The absolute marketing assessment can result in a marketing decision based on predetermined thresholds, e.g., high marketing assessment results in a decision to market the intellectual property asset, and a low marketing assessment results in a decision to abandon the intellectual property asset. In another embodiment, a marketing assessment can be a relative marketing assessment where decisions on marketing are based on the relative strength of the marketing assessments. For example, even if an intellectual property asset receives a low assessment, a decision to market the intellectual property asset may be made because no other intellectual property asset received a higher assessment.
The targeted innovation, in an embodiment, can also be maintained. Examples of maintaining the targeted innovation include enhancing the targeted innovation (e.g., improving features of the innovation), and maintaining one or more intellectual property assets related to the targeted innovation (e.g., paying maintenance fees, auditing the intellectual property assets, etc.). An example of maintaining an intellectual property asset includes assessing the intellectual property asset to determine whether additional intellectual property protection should be sought (e.g., by filing a continuing application, a continuation-in-part application, a divisional application, a reissue application, another copyright registration, a child application, and so on).
Acting to legally protect the targeted innovation as an intellectual property asset can comprises acting to secure protection under an intellectual property law. However, certain intellectual property rights can arise as a matter of setting forth protectable expression (e.g., using an expression indicative of the source of the product, setting forth copyrightable expression, and so forth). Examples of intellectual property law include patent law, trademark law, copyright law, trade secret law, and contract law. Contract law can provide intellectual property protection to an innovation through the use of non-disclosure agreements (âNDAsâ), agreements to take reasonable steps to keep secret, and agreements to include proper marking (e.g., confidential and proprietary).
Examples of acting to legally protect a targeted innovation can also include: directing preparation and filing of a patent application claiming at least a portion of the targeted innovation, receiving an issued patent where the issued patent is based at least in part on the patent application; directing preparation and filing of a trademark application; acting to secure copyright protection (either by operation of law (e.g., common, state, federal) or by seeking registration); taking reasonable steps to protect the targeted innovation as a trade secret; and contracting with a party to protect the targeted innovation as proprietary information.
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, marketing the targeted innovation can include negotiating a marketing transaction and/or executing the marketing transaction. Examples of marketing transactions include a licensing transaction, a cross-licensing transaction, a patent pooling agreement, an assignment transaction, a sales transaction, an abandonment transaction, a trade transaction, and a donation transaction.

 FIG. 220 illustrates an embodiment in accordance with the present invention. In particular, FIG. 220 shows an illustration of a company intellectual property 10-step checklist. The company intellectual property 10-step checklist can comprise an electronic form, a graphical user interface (GUI), or a printed form. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an electronic form such as one illustrated in FIG. 200 can be sent to a user via a network.
 FIG. 220 shows an illustration of a 10-step checklist that can educate innovators as to intellectual property protection issues. The intellectual property protection can relate to patents, trademarks, copyrights, proprietary information, ownership issues, and marketing issues. In an embodiment, the 10-step checklist can include policy statements regarding the protection of innovations that may be patented. For example, a policy related to patent protection can state that work produced by company employees or with company resources be assessed for patentability in a number of situations. For example, when there is a development of a new product, feature, process or software that seems unique, patentability can be assessed. As another example, when improvements to existing technology, product, process or software are made, patentability may be assessed. Patentability can also be assessed when an employee or project funded with company resources results in improved efficiency and/or decreased costs. In a still further example, patentability may be accessed when a new business method is created.
A company intellectual property 10-step checklist as illustrated in FIG. 220 can educate an employee as to company policies regarding patents and prompt the employee to indicate (e.g., check-off) that the company patent policy is understood and efforts that are being made to comply with the company patent policy. FIG. 220 shows examples of company policies that can be conveyed to employees such as trademark policies, copyright policies, proprietary information policies, ownership policies, and/or marketing policies. The examples of company policies presented in FIG. 220 are illustrative of policies regarding intellectual property that can be conveyed to employees for education and compliance purposes.
 FIGS. 221 to 225 show examples of intellectual property protection methods in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 221 shows an illustration of a patent process life cycle. A patent process life cycle in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention can include a plurality of stages such as: a development or improvement stage; a submit disclosure stage; a meet with patent attorney stage; a review draft application stage; a patent application filed stage; and a patent issues stage.
In the development or improvement stage, developments or improvements created by company employees or with company resources can be brought to the attention of an intellectual property protection unit of a company. The development or improvement stage can be related to the one-year period from a time an invention is publicly used or disclosed for filing a patent application that is allowed under the United States patent law. The submit disclosure stage can include a plurality of operations such as reviewing the disclosure for technical merit, analyzing an initial marketing potential and addressing any administrative procedures relating to disclosure submission. In an embodiment, two to eight weeks for disclosure preparation can be allotted. After a disclosure is received from an innovator, a disclosure gift can be sent to the innovator to reward the innovator for submission of the disclosure and to incentivise the innovator to further submit innovation disclosures.
In the meet with patent attorney stage, a plurality of tasks can be accomplished such as disclosure by the innovator of: the state of the industry; the problems solved; and confirmation that sufficient detail has been disclosed so that another innovator with skill in the art can practice the disclosed innovation. In an embodiment, one and one-half to two hours can be allotted for a patent attorney meeting that can be scheduled one to two weeks in advance. The review draft application stage can relate to preparation of at least one draft application by an outside attorney. After an outside attorney has prepared a draft application, the innovator can review the draft and provide comments. In an embodiment, six to eight weeks can be allotted for preparation of the draft application by an attorney, and an innovator can be allotted two weeks to review the application and provide comments.
During the patent application filed stage, four weeks can be allotted to receive official notice of the filing of the patent application from the United States Patent Office. After filing of the patent application, an innovator can receive an innovation award such as a monetary gift to reward the innovator for participating in the patent application filing process and to incentivise the innovator to further cooperate in prosecution of the patent application. The patent issue stage can occur roughly twelve to eighteen months after filing of the patent application. After a patent issues, an inventor can receive a patent issuance award such as a monetary gift. Such a patent issues innovation award can award the innovator and further incentivise the innovator. In an embodiment, an innovator will receive additional innovation awards when certain milestones are met such as issuance of innovator's fifth issued patent, an innovator's tenth issued patent and an innovator's fourteenth issued patent.
 FIG. 222 shows an illustration of educational materials that can be presented to potential innovators with respect to patentable subject matter. As illustrated in FIG. 222, patentable disclosures can be based on business methods, hardware functionality, products, processes, and software systems. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, educational material such as that illustrated in FIG. 222 can be electronically presented to employees and/or potential innovators.
 FIG. 223 shows an embodiment of the present invention related to an internal auditor. In accordance with an embodiment with the present invention, an internal auditor can set forth company policies and goals with respect to innovators and personnel responsible for identifying and protecting intellectual property. For example, an innovator can be informed (e.g., electronically) that he or she should identify innovations within his or her organization, such as processes or services that have been developed or improved, methods of doing business that have been created, and innovations that have cut costs or improved efficiency. The innovator can also be informed that an innovation can be a development or improvement created by a company employee or a development or improvement created with company resources. In an embodiment of the present invention, an intellectual property ambassador can be responsible for managing and protecting intellectual property. An intellectual property ambassador can raise awareness of intellectual property issues to employees regarding innovations and intellectual property. For example, an intellectual property ambassador can assist in the education of employees with respect to intellectual property issues, identify intellectual property risks to business objections, identify intellectual property controls to those risks, and suggest, where appropriate, intellectual property inclusion to organizations that modify business processes and/or methods.
For example, FIG. 224 shows an example of an internal audit and a checklist regarding intellectual property protection. As illustrated in FIG. 224, a sample business process can have business objectives, potential risks, and controls. In an embodiment, the business objectives can include a plurality of objectives such as: transition product to trial testing; integrate product with current service offerings; product to market by deadline; produce savings; and decrease employee turnover ratio.
The transition product to trial testing objective can include potential risks such as a delay in contract negotiations. Controls related to the transition product to trial testing objective can include seeking early patent protection and insuring proprietary information is properly marked. Potential risks related to the integrate product with current service offering objective can include architecture incompatibility issues as well as contract disputes. For example, the integrate product with current services offerings objective can include controls such as ensuring intellectual property ownership, seeking patent protection, and further ensuring proprietary markings.
The potential risks associated with a product to market by deadline objective can include that the project is delayed by missed deadlines and an inability to market a product as intended due to trademark issues. Controls related to the product to market by deadline objective can include contacting a trademark and corporate identity organization early in the business process. The produced savings objective can include a plurality of potential risks such as increased developmental costs and costly overhead. Controls related to producing savings can include identifying outmarket opportunities. The decrease employee turnover ratio objective can include risks such as employee incentive programs being too costly, access to senior management being too bureaucratically controlled, and/or limited budget for employee salary increases. A control related to the decrease employee turnover ratio can be to encourage innovation through an innovation awards program.
 FIG. 225 shows a high level overview to intellectual property protection activities in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 225 illustrates that in accordance with an embodiment with the present invention, 90 percent of all revenues generated by intellectual property marketing efforts can be credited toward the entity that owns the IP asset. For example, IP product licensing can be a process where an IP asset is identified and protected such as a patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret. After the IP asset is protected, the IP asset can be marketed to generate revenue, cost savings, or be used in trades related to intellectual property. For example, in an embodiment, after an IP asset is identified and protected, IP marketing can undertake marketing of the IP asset. When the IP marketing effort is successful and generates revenue, the revenue can be allocated between the entity that owns the IP asset and the IP marketing organization. For example, in an embodiment, an IP asset can be owned by one organization within a company and the IP marketing can be performed by another organization within the company.
