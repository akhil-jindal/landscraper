BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
This disclosure concerns a system and method to identify the performance capability of the finance functions of an organization on a scale of representative capabilities. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance capability level of key assessment areas of the finance functions within the processes of an organization.
2. Background Information
Businesses in every industry must adapt to an increasingly competitive environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the global nature of most industries greatly increases the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day to day basis, let alone growing and prospering.
Despite the need for a business to meet the challenges of the global marketplace, often the business lacks clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of an improvement program directed to finance transformation. Many chief financial officers (CFOs) fail to measure finance cost and performance in a rigorous way, such as the resources expended on finance, the costs by process and in comparison with other businesses in similar industries. Often, CFOs lack the information necessary to prioritize improvement initiatives, develop a compelling business case for such initiatives and measure performance improvement consistently. These shortcomings severely constrain the business, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, identifying specific processes to which improvements may be made can be very difficult, either because the business itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the business frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.
Even if the business can identify one of the many processes that need to improve, the business may not know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether intermediate goals exist that should be reached along the way. As a result, businesses struggle to meet the demands of the modern global marketplace and fail to identify cost reduction opportunities for margin improvement to reach other important goals.
Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance capability level of key assessment areas within the processes of an organization.
SUMMARY
A finance function high performance capability assessment (FF-HPCA) model helps businesses meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance capability along which the current practices of the business may be located. The FF-HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and capability gaps within business operations. In addition, the FF-HPCA model also helps the business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish levels of capability during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate capability goal. As a result, the business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that reduce inefficiencies and waste.
The FF-HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance capability scale dimension. The performance capability scale dimension defines multiple capability levels. The performance capability levels may form a scale of increasing organizational performance capability. One example of such a scale includes a âBasicâ capability level, a âCompetitiveâ capability level, and a âMarket Leadingâ capability level. Each performance capability level includes criteria specific to a corresponding finance function key assessment area. Each finance function key assessment area identifies some aspect of a finance function capability of a business.
Finance function process capabilities of a business may be grouped into platforms. For example, the FF-HPCA model may group the finance function capabilities of an organization into a high-level platform (e.g., finance process excellence platform). Platforms may include sub-platforms, as well as capabilities, and capabilities may include other capabilities (e.g., sub-capabilities). For example, the finance process excellence platform may include a âfinance function managementâ platform, finance and accounting operations platform, enterprise performance management, corporate finance platform and enterprise risk management platform. Examples of capabilities within the finance function management platform may include a manage finance organization capability and a drive enterprise wide change capability.
The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example, the vision and strategy platform includes performance capability criteria for external analysis and internal business planning key assessment areas at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension and in each of the key assessment areas along the key factor dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the FF-HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which finance function business practices may be compared to ascertain where the finance function capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.
Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The FF-HPCA model establishes a multidimensional performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables. The key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ performance capability level, a âCompetitiveâ performance capability level and a âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level. The âBasicâ performance capability level specifies âBasicâ finance function performance assessment criteria, the âCompetitiveâ performance capability level specifies âCompetitiveâ finance function performance assessment criteria, and the âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level specifies âMarket Leadingâ finance function performance assessment criteria. The FF-HPCA model receives input data that specifies a finance function business platform (e.g., a business area and/or business process) and a finance function key assessment area (e.g., capability and/or business process) for analysis. The FF-HPCA model searches the multidimensional business performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the business platform and capability within the platform and the key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The FF-HPCA model initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance capability level for the key assessment area.
The FF-HPCA model provides quantitative assessment of finance function costs and performance of an organization, including comparisons to peers, supplemented with qualitative analysis to provide context and to maximize analytical value. The FF-HPCA model identifies and quantifies improvement opportunities through internal and external performance comparisons (e.g., benchmarking metrics within and/or across multiple industries), highlights specific processes, regions, and/or business units that provide the greatest opportunities for cost reductions and/or performance improvement, and establishes a rigorous baseline to measure the impact of future improvements. The FF-HPCA model provides a knowledge base from which to define improvement recommendations, build a confident business case and focus on rigorous metrics and continuous improvement. The FF-HPCA model calculates quartile rankings for each key assessment area of an organization compared to industry benchmarks. The FF-HPCA model calculates the performance level of each finance function key assessment area, including the cost of each key assessment area as a percent of revenue, and the cost of each key assessment area according to full-time equivalents (FTEs) per dollars of revenue (e.g., FTEs/revenue).
Referring briefly to FIGS. 49-51, the FF-HPCA model comprises a finance function process excellence framework, finance function diagnostic tool and benchmarking. The FF-HPCA model analyzes information regarding finance function key assessment areas of an organization, calculates performance results, and produces FF-HPCA model reports, including: FF-HPCA benchmarking output report 4900; FF-HPCA benchmarking cost and FTE summary report 5000; and FF-HPCA quartile ranking by process-cost and FTEs report 5100. The FF-HPCA model reports and the information contained within the reports may be graphically displayed, presented and/or communicated in any number of ways.
 FIG. 1 shows a finance function high performance capability assessment (FF-HPCA) model 100. The FF-HPCA model 100 (e.g., finance process excellence framework) may be implemented as a multi-level hierarchy encompassing all processes for which a CFO may be accountable. The FF-HPCA model 100 specifies a finance process excellence platform (e.g., hierarchy) 102 including a finance function management platform 104, finance and accounting operations platform 106, enterprise performance management 108, corporate finance 110 and enterprise risk management platform 112. Additional, different, or fewer platforms may be used in other implementations, each platform defining additional, different, or fewer capabilities. Each platform includes one or more capabilities. Capabilities within the FF-HPCA model 100 may include sub-capabilities, which may be organized into further sub-capabilities to form a hierarchy as deep as desired to meet any particular implementation target. The platforms and capabilities of the FF-HPCA model 100 form a multi-level hierarchy, as illustrated in FIGS. 10-48.
A capability may include corresponding key assessment areas. Each key assessment area may include or define additional key assessment areas. In other words, a business capability may include sub-capabilities, and therefore, key assessment areas corresponding to the multiple sub-capabilities. Additional, different, or fewer finance function performance assessment criteria may be used in other implementations, each finance function performance assessment criteria corresponding to additional, different, or fewer platforms and/or capabilities.
In one implementation, the finance function management platform 104 includes: a manage finance organization capability 114 and a drive enterprise wide change capability 116. The accounting operations platform 106 includes: a general account and reporting (record to report) capability 118, fixed asset accounting capability 120, purchase to pay capability 122, a travel and expense reimbursements (T&E) capability 124, order to cash capability 126, âproduct costing and inventory accountingâ capability 128, a payroll capability 130 and a âmaintain finance systems and data structuresâ capability 132. The enterprise performance management platform 108 includes: a strategic planning/shareholder value targeting capability 134, a target setting capability 136, a âplanning, resource allocation and forecastingâ capability 138, and a performance reporting and analytics capability 140. The corporate finance platform 110 includes internal controls capability 142, an inventor relations capability 144, treasury and cash management capability 146, and corporate tax capability 148. The enterprise risk management platform 112 includes: a financial risk management capability 150, and a non-financial risk management capability 152.
 FIG. 2 shows a portion of the FF-HPCA model 100 and multiple capability levels 208. The capability levels 208 establish a scale of increasing organizational performance capability. In FIG. 2, the capability levels 208 include a âBasicâ capability level 210, a âCompetitiveâ capability level 212, and a âMarket Leadingâ capability level 214. The FF-HPCA model 100 establishes a performance capability scale 216 along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC) (e.g., 220-230).
 FIG. 3 illustrates that each capability within a platform (e.g., the finance function management platform 104) may include additional capabilities (e.g., 302-316). In other words, a business capability may include multiple sub-capabilities. For example, FIG. 3 shows the finance function management platform 104 with the manage finance organization capability 114 with additional capabilities. FIG. 3 shows the manage finance organization capability 114 that further includes an: identify proper role of finance capability 302, understand needs of internal customers capability 304, manage delivery of finance services capability 306, manage cost of finance capability 308, manage performance of finance function capability 310, create/maintain finance organization structure capability 312, manage finance workforce develop finance skills capability 314, and continuously improve finance function capability 316.
Table 1 provides an explanation of the manage finance organization capability 114 and key assessment areas (e.g., capabilities 302-316) within the manage finance organization capability 114. The key assessment areas (e.g., capabilities 302-316) include performance capability criteria (PCC) (e.g., 220-230). A capability under evaluation may be assigned a capability level 208 based on a capability position 218 along the performance capability scale 216 (e.g., the âcompetitiveâ capability level 212).
Performance capability criteria (e.g., 220-230) populate the FF-HPCA model 100. The performance capability criteria capture criteria, characteristics, and/or other features of a capability at a particular capability level for a key assessment area. Examples below illustrate performance capability criteria that provide unexpectedly good analysis and benchmarking for the finance functions of an organization. The FF-HPCA model 100 performance capability criteria provide a tool for determining where a platform and capability under examination falls along the performance capability scale 216. For example, process engineers may interview a business or receive data about the business to determine, measure, or otherwise ascertain the characteristics, criteria, and other features of a particular capability implemented within the business. The process engineers may compare the characteristics of the business to the performance capability criteria in the FF-HPCA model 100 and arrive at a capability level 208 for the capability under examination. In doing so, for example, the process engineers may identify where the capability under examination falls in terms of capability level for each key assessment area of a capability and determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 216 for the capability under examination. Performance capability criteria may populate the FF-HPCA model 100 in whole or in part. Multiple high performance capability assessment models may be collected and stored with the performance capability criteria for future retrieval and possible modification in a capability detail pool, discussed below.

Table 2 describes additional market leading criteria for key assessment areas (e.g., capabilities 302-316) of the âmanage finance organizationâ capability 114. FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âmanage finance organizationâ capability 114. Market leading criteria for âidentify proper role of financeâ capability 302 may include: maintaining a key role in the management team; actively participating in all key decisions affecting the future of the company; and redirecting time from transaction processing, data gathering and reconciliation.
Market leading criteria for âunderstand needs of internal customerâ capability 304 may include: formally surveying users of finance services to better understand the needs and wants as well as the users' perceptions of finance capabilities; leveraging an online survey tool (e.g., for broad surveys) and/or a standard interview guide (e.g., for more focused surveys); repeating surveys as part of an ongoing cycle and measuring changes over time; and modifying content and delivery of finance services, as appropriate based on identified needs and wants of internal customers.
Market leading criteria for âmanage delivery of finance servicesâ capability 306 may include: management possessing a deep understanding of company strategy and value drivers; and assessing opportunities to add value based on the company strategy and value drivers, along with a rigorous definition of the role that finance plays (e.g., low cost provider of basic finance services, and/or intimate business partner). Market leading criteria for âmanage delivery of finance servicesâ capability 306 may include: publishing formal quarterly communications (e.g., a web postcard) to all executives above a certain level that highlight relevant changes in finance services, new initiatives, and results of satisfaction surveys; and the communications may be a combination of information, education and internal marketing.
Market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may include: leveraging cost collection templates and guidelines to ensure all costs are captured consistently; identifying finance costs incurred outside of the âfinance budgetâ; and decomposing capabilities by process (e.g., record-to-report and purchase-to-pay capabilities), by function (e.g., controllership and treasury), by cost type (e.g., people and technology), by activity (e.g., data gathering and analysis), and/or by geography. Market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may further include: identifying cost drivers and root causes of any cost issues; evaluating the cost of various finance components in connection with the relative value add of each of the various finance components; setting formal cost reduction targets based on benchmarking analysis and/or other objective measures. Establishing formal cost reduction targets may allow finance to better prioritize cost reduction activities and measure progress. Market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may further include: engaging a formal cost reduction program lead by a single senior executive with oversight of all individual cost reduction efforts in order to make meaningful progress against cost reduction objectives; managing all transactional and general accounting and reporting activities, and selected reporting and analytics that are standard and/or recurring; locating centralized activities in low cost locations (e.g., on, near, or off-shore) based on cost versus quality trade-offs.
A complex IT architecture may be a significant driver of cost (e.g., excess data gathering, reconciliation, data entry, and IT maintenance). Accordingly, market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may include standardizing on a single enterprise resource management (ERP) system and decommissioning legacy systems. The efficiency of âdown-streamâ activities (e.g., accounts payable) may be heavily influenced by âup-streamâ activities (e.g., purchasing). Accordingly, market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may include global end-to-end processes (e.g., ârecord to reportââR2R, âpurchase to payââP2P, and âorder to cashââOTC) that maximize efficiency and create seamless hand-offs between entities.
Market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may reflect a conscious trade-off between costs and service levels. For example, the use of technology may heavily facilitate a self service model (e.g., a web portal to deliver finance reports). Common data structures and definitions reduce data gathering and reconciliation time, streamline reporting and analysis, and eliminate uncertainty regarding particular terms used (e.g., âcustomerâ, âheadcountâ, and âfixed costâ). Market leading criteria for âmanage cost of financeâ capability 308 may include employing a formal cost control framework, making managers throughout the organization responsible for cost control within the framework and helping the managers understand the cost implications of actions.
Market leading criteria for âmanage performance of finance functionâ capability 310 may include: identifying a list of metrics that cover the spectrum of finance performance; rationalizing the list of metrics based on the level of impact on the finance function and the organization as a whole; setting formal performance targets based on benchmarking analysis and/or other objective measures; and setting formal targets to better prioritize improvement initiatives and measure progress. Market leading criteria for âmanage performance of finance functionâ capability 310 may include: assigning primary responsibility for each metric to an executive with the authority and influence to drive improvement in each assigned metric; integrating the performance reviews of the finance function into the overall cycle of enterprise performance reviews; and delivering finance function metrics via web based portal, as well as enterprise wide metrics.
Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include: consciously defining the finance organization structure rather than allowing the structure to simply âevolveâ over time; periodically reviewing the structure for effectiveness; and re-structuring the organization as necessary. Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include: designing finance organization structures that are responsive to overall organization objectives and take into consideration the role of finance (e.g., low cost provider of basic finance services, intimate business partner). Examples considerations include transaction processing (e.g., low cost objective and clerical skills), GAAP reporting (e.g., accuracy objective and CPA skills), decision support (e.g., business partnering objective and MBA skills), and specialized expertise (e.g., various objectives and highly specialized skills). Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include: tightly aligning decision support resources and co-locating resources with the management teams the resources support to allow more effective business partnering; while having decision support resources report directly to the CFO to allow better, standards, consistency, finance career paths, skills development.
Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may further include: for each major finance process, function and activity, formally defining the inputs, roles, and outputs for corporate finance and business unit (BU) finance; and defining working relationships and âhand-offsâ between the corporate finance and BU finance. BU, plant, and geography specific finance may be physically co-located with their respective management team, the BU, plant, and geography specific finance report directly to the CFO (even though a âstrong dotted lineâ relationship might exist); CFO should control the hiring, firing, and career development of all finance employees along with the finance budget and the scope, content, and delivery of finance services; one exception is Internal Audit which should report to the Audit Committee of the Board. Examples include investor relations and strategic planning.
Shadow finance organizations hinder efforts to drive consistency, financial control, and low cost. For example, a manager may create a âfinance teamâ with a direct reporting relationship to the manager inconsistent with the organization structure. Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include using organization controls to prevent the creation of âshadow financeâ organizations.
Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include: ensuring that users of finance services have an effective working relationship with a primary finance contact; and authorizing the creation of shared services and outsourcing a âcritical massâ of scarce and/or specialized resources to help finance to drive consistency and standardization. Shared services and outsourcing may include essentially all general accounting and transaction processing activities, such as tax, treasury, pricing, high powered analytics, and M&A. True shared services (as opposed to simple centralization) includes a number of components including a formal service delivery model, service level agreements, common processes and technologies, and an appropriate governance structure. Market leading criteria for âcreate/maintain finance organization structureâ capability 312 may include: limiting redundant transaction processing activities performed at the country level; and performing country specific activities in-country on an exception basis only; distributing activities between a âcentral hubâ and selected low cost locations. Though activities may be located in a number of geographic locations, the centers may be a part of a single shared services organization, led by a senior executive, and employ a formal governance structure. In one implementation, rather than a âfinance shared services organizationâ, a âmulti-function business services organization may be employed. The benefits of a shared services organization include maximizing economies of scale, integrated facility utilization, a single shared services leadership team, end-to-end process support for cross-functional processes, single face of shared services for all customers and cross functional job rotation and career options.
Market leading criteria for âmanage finance workforce; develop finance skillsâ capability 314 may include: defining the overall role as well as specific responsibilities, of each finance position, maintaining in a ârole dictionaryâ, and be reviewing and updating as necessary; identifying all skills required by finance professionals (e.g., functional, technical, leadership and communications); identifying the mix of skills required for each role and/or career level; and creating a competency model which describes the progression from âbasicâ skills through âexpertâ, and identifies the level of mastery required for each role and/or career level. Market leading criteria for âmanage finance workforce; develop finance skillsâ capability 314 may include ensuring that finance professionals possess the ability to: perform typical accounting and control functions, as well as the ability to partner with other functions; instill a value creation mindset in the broader organization; identify and pursuing value creation opportunities; lead change programs; and making and/or influence important business decisions. Market leading criteria for âmanage finance workforce; develop finance skillsâ capability 314 may include employing rotational programs for finance staff and mid-level finance personnel. Rotational programs may provide opportunities for finance personnel to identify more appealing career paths, in addition to providing a broad exposure to the entire finance function, and potentially increasing the breadth of finance skills of the finance personnel. Market leading criteria for âmanage finance workforce; develop finance skillsâ capability 314 may further include: defining various âjumping offâ points where executives may cease rotation and become more specialized; and ensuring that individual performance objectives for all finance staff align with finance mission and overall company strategy.
Market leading criteria for âcontinuously improve finance functionâ capability 316 may include: ensuring that managers continuously improve cost effectiveness and budgets; performance evaluations reflect continuous improvement as a goal; maintaining an improvement program with a senior leader/sponsor; regular tracking finance cost and performance metrics; maintaining a mechanism to propose and evaluate new improvement ideas, and traditional project management discipline (e.g., stakeholders, project plans, timelines and deliverables). Market leading criteria for âcontinuously improve finance functionâ capability 316 may further include: creating a formal framework to identify and evaluate improvement ideas and/or future state capabilities; continuously evaluating needs of the larger enterprise, the role of finance; objectively analyze existing finance capabilities; and implementing an approach for approving initiatives and integrating initiatives into a larger change management program.

Table 7 describes additional market leading criteria for the capabilities of the finance and accounting operations platform 106. Market leading criteria for finance and accounting operations platform 106 includes âgeneral accounting and reporting (record to report)â capability 118. FIGS. 13-19 illustrate capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âgeneral accounting and reporting (record to report)â capability 118.
The foundation for financial transactions is the ERP code block, which includes the chart of accounts (COA) as well as other master data elements (detailed cost centers, profit centers, legal entities, currencies, product types, internal counterparties, customers, sales codes, and tax codes). Market leading criteria for finance and accounting operations platform 106 may include: standardizing all of the business units, geographies and legal entities of an organization onto a single code block so that transaction processing is simplified and account reconciliations, analyses, and adjustments are sharply reduced. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may further include: providing online, user-friendly access to all relevant accounting policies, procedures, and account definitions; standardizing core processes and policies (e.g., areas such as transfer pricing, inter-company transactions, payments and receipts) to improve accessibility and ease to data entry; limiting the amount of reconciliation and adjustments that hold up a close; improving efficiencies, (e.g., in SSC/BPO environments); streamlining data roll-up and summarization, closing, and consolidation. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: validating data at the source of input, rather than at a subsequent point; employing a set of common validation tables and rules in all transaction systems; establishing and enforcing information quality responsibilities with the information source provider; recording transactions once and capturing all relevant information (e.g., financial, statutory, management, and tax) to eliminate statutory and management discrepancies and streamlines tax processes. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may also include: locating transaction system views in subsidiary ledgers rather than in the general ledger (GL); posting all transactions to sub-ledgers rather to the GL so that the GL remains clean, minimizing reconciliation and analysis between the GL and sub-ledgers. Maximizing use of standard and recurring journal entries may limit manual activity.
Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: automating recurring entries and related controls (e.g., prior to close) to simplify transaction processing and eliminate time and critical path items from the closing process. Examples of recurring entries and related controls include: inter-company transactions, currency translation, allocations, accruals and reversals. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may further include: eliminating all unnecessary accruals; and imposing materiality thresholds. For example, accruals with low volatility and/or materiality estimates may be used and accruals may be performed earlier in the month (e.g., before the closing process begins). Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: automating all key accruals, including reversals; creating accruals dynamically when a commitment occurs (e.g., goods and/or services are received); employing subsystems rather than people to calculate key accruals; prohibiting accruals and allocations to be performed via personal computer spreadsheets; and limiting allocations to only controllable expenses and revenues. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: prohibiting allocations less than a certain dollar amount; applying basic rules such as whether an allocation adds value (e.g., different decisions without allocation); ensuring that the âreceivingâ manager controls and/or influences the allocated costs; performing allocations in ERP and/or consolidation systems rather than manually calculating allocations using a spreadsheet. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: booking allocations prior to the close, based on fixed-rate, budgeted rates and/or prior month. Allocation cycles may be run automatically overnight, and the basis, validity, usefulness and relevance of allocations may be reassessed frequently. Market leading criteria for âfinance and accounting operationsâ platform 106 may include: ensuring that necessary information is captured once, in a consistent format, for each journal entry across the entire enterprise; and ensuring that management accounting requirements lead to identifying reclassification needs and legally required reclassification only upon hard close; requiring approvals for selected entries based on pre-defined policy which incorporates dollar value and risk; and reducing the approval process cycle time and manual effort; and automating entries resulting from transactions between companies leveraging web technology.
 FIG. 14 illustrates the hierarchy of âPerform Inter-Company Accountingâ capability 404. Market leading criteria for âPerform Inter-Company Accountingâ capability 404 may include clearly defining and strictly enforcing an inter-entity transaction policy; promoting the use of internal âcontractsâ and formal documentation to justify inter-company transactions to reduce disputes from occurring after processing a transaction; automatically managing inter-organization transactions in the accounting systems (e.g., credit transactions may automatically generate the debit transactions in the debtor set of books) to reduce âout-of balanceâ conditions and reconciliations. Market leading criteria for âPerform Inter-Company Accountingâ capability 404 may include: allowing the sending organization to create both the receivables and payables entries streamlines inter-company billings in addition to eliminating âout of balanceâ situations; agreeing inter-company balances some number of days (e.g., 5 days) before the month end by reporting balances in advance and monitoring the final weeks transactions; investigating mismatches over a certain threshold (by the local reporting units) after applying the group consolidation tool; simplifying inter-company transactions, reconciliations, and automating off-set entries; employing worldwide data definitions so that all entities can agree on the balances to included in a particular account.
 FIG. 14 further illustrates the hierarchy of âManage Interfacesâ capability 406. Market leading criteria for âManage Interfacesâ capability 406 may include: posting all transaction activities to sub-ledgers rather than to the general ledger (GL); loading sub-ledger source system data into the GL on a weekly, daily, and/or instantaneously to eliminate some activities from the close process critical path and allow interim flash reporting during the month; reducing manual activities by employing automated interfaces between source systems and main repositories; aggregating and closing non-critical sub-ledgers prior to month-end to spread closing activities over a longer period without adversely impacting the moth-and close cycle. Market leading criteria for âManage Interfacesâ capability 406 may include: executing selected processes prior to the close and then perform catch-up activities during the actual close.
Integrated ERP solutions can provide drill-down capability from the GL to the sub-ledgers simplifying account analysis. Market leading criteria for âManage Interfacesâ capability 406 may include: employing an ERP solution to perform data extracts from internal and external systems into a central repository to meet multiple reporting requirements (one version of the truth); aggregating receiving and shipping data more frequently to facilitate ongoing accessibility to data, rather than only at period end, and thereby reducing reconciliation; deploying a single ERP system worldwide and eliminate and/or limit the use of legacy systems; transforming all sub-ledger account validation to the common ERP chart of accounts which supports the corporate general ledger; integrating systems to eliminate and/or reduce stand-alone sub-ledgers, feeder systems and the related interfaces and reconciliation; establishing common definitions and usage guidelines for key data elements, regardless of the system where the data resides; and facilitating efficient interface, roll-up and aggregation.
 FIG. 15 illustrates the hierarchy of âAnalyze & Reconcile Accountsâ capability 408. Market leading criteria for âAnalyze & Reconcile Accountsâ capability 408 may include: employing an expansive cost center, profit center, legal entity structure and chart of accounts adds significant complexity to the R2R process including account reconciliation, analysis, and adjustment; and assigning accounts to entities (e.g., corporate controller or SSC) and individuals within the entities based on account materiality, complexity, and risk. Market leading criteria for âAnalyze & Reconcile Accountsâ capability 408 may further include: defining the reconciliation frequency for each account and maintaining formal calendar and tracking of completed reconciliations; automatically managing inter-organization transactions in the accounting systems (e.g., credit transactions automatically generate the debit transactions in the debtor set of books); ensuring that local reporting units maintain ownership of information and responsibility for quality and accuracy of the local reporting unit reports and corporate notifies the local unit of errors.
 FIG. 16 illustrates the hierarchy of âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410. Market leading criteria for âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410 may include: maintaining a highly structured and rigorous close process so that finance can pre-determine close; issuing a calendar on an annual basis that identifies the when each accounting period should close, when inter-company balances should be agreed, when the ledgers are to be closed, and the dates for various cut-offs; implementing and/or re-designing a consolidated close calendar managed by a single process owner to shorten the closing cycle; ensuring that all purchase orders are registered, purchase and sales invoices are processed and expense claims are submitted; holding individuals accountable for major errors that impact the close timeline; and employing automatic âtriggerâ in the general ledger (GL) that downloads data to the consolidation tool on a set date each month. Market leading criteria for âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410 may include: employing a formal and pre-defined communication approach, issue resolution process and decision framework to speed identification and resolution of close issues; monitoring continuous improvement of the close process by developing and tracking metrics including days to close, days to report, # of manual journal entries; and periodically reviewing process, systems and data to identify and manage bottlenecks. Market leading criteria for âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410 may include: leveraging formal communication vehicles (e.g., meetings, conference calls, websites, and online activity tracking) to ensure that all issues are raised and resolved in the most timely manner; discussing any unusual results with management and auditors; performing less analysis, limiting reconciliations and adjustments during non-quarter end months, and adjusting materiality thresholds in connection with strong quarter-end closing and reporting processes and strong internal controls; aggregating and closing non-critical sub-ledgers prior to month-end to spread closing activities over a longer period without adversely impacting the month-end close cycle; ensuring that as many activities as possible are performed in parallel rather then serially to dramatically shorten the close cycle; limiting period end and closing entries to only those that are required for financial reporting purposes and/or are material from a management reporting standpoint (e.g., corrections, adjustments, and reclassifications).
Market leading criteria for âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410 may include: optimizing the materiality levels for making adjusting entries, allocations and/or inter-company charges; establishing and enforcing materiality thresholds; evaluating the impacts at the consolidated level when determining materiality thresholds for closing cycle adjustments; avoiding missing a closing deadline by keeping source systems open to book last minute adjustments that are not material to the enterprise as a whole. Often, in decentralized companies with âfull P&L business unitsâ, the full P&L business units attempt to ânegotiateâ with corporate for last minute adjustments. Market leading criteria for âClose Books & Consolidate Financial Resultsâ capability 410 may include: employing a âcontrollable P&Lâ to eliminate a negotiation process around non-controllable expense allocations; maintaining exchange rates in the system by corporate so that currency translations occur automatically (e.g., systems, process, timetable, foreign exchange translation and âtopsideâ entries); harmonizing the code block so that finance can automate the consolidation process through the use of a standard consolidation tool; transmitting balances directly to corporate consolidating books, where consolidation has not been automated; transmitting balances directly to corporate consolidating books and eliminating other hierarchical consolidations; restricting allocations to areas where there is a business reason to justify the allocation rationale; eliminating hierarchical, multi-level, or sub-consolidations, where possible; and transmitting data electronically with limited and/or no manual input or re-keying.
 FIG. 17 illustrates the hierarchy of âPerform Financial Reportingâ capability 412. Market leading criteria for âPerform Financial Reportingâ capability 412 may include: management understanding the differences between internal and external reporting needs so that GAAP P&L is not used as the single tool to run the business; extracting data from internal and external systems into a central repository to meet multiple reporting requirements; eliminating stand-alone statutory reporting systems; supporting all statutory/management reporting requirements through a single chart of accounts; employing a single and/or few data sources for US GAAP, IAS, and local country requirements to allow consolidated results to feed financial report directly, without adjustment, reclassification and/or modification; ensuring that ERP (e.g., consolidation system) automatically feeds financial reports and templates; ensuring that quarterly hard closes are performed to meet external reporting needs, and monthly soft closes meet internal management needs; implementing comprehensive statutory reporting procedures that are regularly updated and communicated to staff (e.g., base statutory reporting on draft tax charge and liabilities to an acceptable materiality within the same fully integrated system). Market leading criteria for âPerform Financial Reportingâ capability 412 may include: regularly reviewing accounting policies and compare to best practice, with reviews actively involving external advisors, Board members and the audit committee; explaining statutory accounting numbers to investors in terms of drivers of long term shareholder value; and supplying additional non-statutory information to support explanations.
 FIG. 18 illustrates the hierarchy of âPerform Regulatory Reportingâ capability 414. Market leading criteria for âPerform Regulatory Reportingâ capability 414 may include: implementing comprehensive statutory reporting procedures that are regularly updated and communicated to staff (e.g., base statutory reporting on draft tax charge and liabilities to an acceptable materiality within the same fully integrated system); and regularly reviewing accounting policies and compare to best practice, with reviews actively involving external advisors, Board members and the audit committee.
 FIG. 19 illustrates the hierarchy of âMaintain Accounting Master Dataâ capability 418. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Accounting Master Dataâ capability 418 may include: centralizing ownership of establishing and maintaining a standardized code block as well as standardization of other master data. For example, corporate finance may control all master data changes and only specific people may be allowed to make changes, while other people and/or entities may little or no access to such information. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Accounting Master Dataâ capability 418 may include: leveraging formal request template, approval structure, central control, and policy; defining specific standards that must be met in order to add a new account and cost center. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Accounting Master Dataâ capability 418 may include: identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) by which the organization desires to operate the business; designing the financial language of the organization to enable reporting by those KPIs; defining reporting requirements and then design the code block (e.g., ERP code block, which includes the chart of accounts); defining appropriate code block segments to support profitability and cost analysis and reporting so that one code block element can answer one business question; eliminating redundancy and inconsistency of values assigned to codes; design the language to capture data in basic elements that answer 7 fundamental business questions (who, what, why, where, when, how, which); employing combinations of basic elements to support different views of data; providing common and consistent definitions of code to both employees and applications. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Accounting Master Dataâ capability 418 may include: planning and anticipating future mergers, divestments, re-organizations, geographic expansion and new product lines; designing intelligence into a code to restrict the number of values that the code can support and increase the amount of data input; prevent systems processing from relying on the values of certain elements and/or portions of elements when mnemonics are involved; deriving roll-ups by the reporting mechanism rather than embedding roll-ups in the language; employing relational tables to enable roll-ups; and providing end-user tools to users to define ad-hoc roll-ups.

Relationships may include national purchasing agreements, consolidated and centralized billings, consignment inventories (e.g., wholesaler holding stock of supplier âon consignmentâ, which is paid for after sales to customer), evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) to pay on receipt of goods and/or services may eliminate the need to receive and process vendor invoices. âManage and record requisition and purchaseâ capability 2202 may include: employing online purchase requisition submission and approval; using paperless catalogues with real time pricing and quantity; employing Outbound Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and/or an Internet link to vendor sites for purchase order and requisition; employing Inbound EDI and/or an Internet link from procurement card and vendors; actively pursuing vendors to leverage electronic commerce; analyzing and evaluating total cost of ownership over the expected life of the product and/or service, and assessing vendors, products and services accordingly (e.g., in additional to more traditional price, quality and terms); formulating and implementing different strategies for different commodity groups; and leveraging âspecialistâ buyers.
The âmanage inbound documentsâ capability 2204 may include implementing initiatives to reduce invoice volumes, despite a possible increase in matching issues, and centralizing the receipt of invoices; performing opening, sorting, scanning in the same location where invoices are received.
âRecord Goods Receipt; Approve and Schedule Paymentâ capability 2302 may include: eliminating approvals for stock goods (e.g., materials and merchandise may be automatically replenished); scanning delivery notes and receivers at the warehouse and entering service acceptances directly with outstanding deliveries flagged on the system; using computerized scanners to read and enter data as opposed to manual entry of invoice amounts; leveraging analytics tools and reporting to identify duplicate payments; performing âpreventativeâ analytics, as well as post âaudit and complianceâ analytics; raising limit for checks requiring signatures; automatically approving low dollar invoices; reviewing large dollar invoices and statistically sampling the remainder (e.g., through a tie back to PO); and refusing invoices without proper order number.
âProcess paymentsâ capability 2502 may include: eliminating paper checks to the extent possible; holding check stock in safe in locked office space so that access is limited to a few designated key holders; requiring suppliers to invoice once per month and use composite invoices for high volume supplies to reduce invoice volumes; invoicing by GRN to improve and more efficiently match.
âAddress vendor inquiries; handle disputes and exceptionsâ capability 2602 may include: implementing Internet enabled link and/or interactive voice response (IVR) unit allows suppliers to perform and/or access account status inquiries, payment inquiries, remittance advices, and vendor reconciliations; reducing help desk employee time and related cost; reducing and/or eliminating the number of personnel involved in contacting a vendor for a particular request; dedicating personnel to particular vendors to develop an efficient and consistent handling of vendor inquiries and requests.
âPerform P2P reconciliations and period end close activitiesâ capability 2604 may include: ensuring that all purchase orders are registered, purchase and sales invoices are processed and expense claims submitted; holding individuals accountable for major errors that impact the close timeline; and implementing a formal and pre-defined communication approach and issue resolution process and decision framework to speed identification and resolution to close issues.
âManage Vendor Data/Data Masterâ capability 2702 may include: preventing multiple (e.g., duplicate) vendor records that lead to inaccuracies in tracking and managing individual vendor activity. Separate records can also lead to separate contracts with different prices and payment terms for identical items. Structured parent-child relationships allow companies to address the situation where they deal with multiple entities within the same vendor company. âManage Vendor Data/Data Masterâ capability 2702 may include: providing major ERP vendors robust vendor master data management capabilities to efficiently produce visibility into global purchasing commitments, spend, and payables balance for each supplier and to maximize buying power; regularly searching for and eliminating duplicates; and regularly analyzing inactive vendors
âManage corporate P-card programâ capability 2704 may include: implementing separate P-Cards for each account to be charged; coordinating with frequently used vendors to have department and accounts and/or other relevant information entered at point of sale by vendor; setting a materiality limit under which manual allocations are prohibited; employing procurement cards to minimize the high volume of low dollar PO's and invoices being processed; minimizing vendor blocking where exceptions may occur (e.g., blocking all hotel charges when a travel card is not used may block charges for meeting facility rental from a hotel); relying on budget controls for certain expense items; and automatically checking orders against budgets.

 FIGS. 30-35 illustrate capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âorder to cashâ capability 126. Table 18 describes additional market leading criteria for the capabilities of the order to cash capability 126, including criteria for: âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30); âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30); âMaintain customer master dataâ capability 3102 (FIG. 31); âInvoice customerâ capability 3202 (FIG. 32); âMaintain NR ledger and apply cashâ capability 3302 (FIG. 33); âManage and process collectionsâ capability 3402 (FIG. 34); and âManage and Process Disputes and Deductionsâ capability 3502 (FIG. 35).
Market leading criteria for âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30) may include: ensuring that the credit policy of the organization is properly enforced by confirming that the policy is clear to all parties involved; ensuring that the policy supports corporate objectives because credit risk tolerance can have a direct impact on sales and revenue; and removing conflict of interest between sales objectives and credit risk management. Credit management can be used to produce significant value but requires investment to develop and continually refine. New credit requests may be validated against current account activity, previous denials and previous write-offs, but may not be necessary for regular, high volume customers but is recommended for customers who are less established. Market leading criteria for âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30) may include: aligning all parts of the organization with the desired credit quality; eliminating conflicts of interest between managing credit quality and generating sales; reducing transaction process expense; reducing cycle time and transaction processing expense; reducing cycle time and transaction processing expense. Credit evaluations may be performed on all customers because gaps may exist regarding customer credit activity processed on systems owned by other organizations. Credit models may be updated regularly to reflect experience with different types of customers/organizations using both internal and external data. Market leading criteria for âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30) may improve customer satisfaction by simplifying the credit evaluation process. Using credit risk to differentiate treatment is a leading practice most commonly used with consumer debt but may also be applied for business customers (e.g., the customer base may include a significant small business component).
Market leading criteria for âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 may include restricting risky customers to lower tier product/services until credit worthiness is proven; and limiting uncollectible charges by blocking premium tier product/services. For example, a new customer for Product Line A may already have history with Product Line B so the Product Line B data should be used in making a new credit decision. Authorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 may include: improving the ability to manage credit risk by having a complete view into exposure related to a particular customer; reducing credit risk exposure by limiting fraudulent activity. Reducing credit risk exposure by limiting fraudulent activity may include: using deposits or automatic bill pay to minimize credit risk and allow the organization to do business with customers that would otherwise be turned down. Market leading criteria for Authorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30) may include: maximizing coverage for credit scoring and updating; and using 3rd party data to provide a broader base of information, beyond information available internally, on which to evaluate credit worthiness. Market leading criteria for âAuthorize and manage creditâ capability 3002 (FIG. 30) prevents and reduces fraudulent activity such as the use of a stolen identity and/or other account information, and reduces cycle time and transaction processing expenses, and may include providing online access to information that can be used throughout the OTC process including collections.
Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) may include implementing an integrated solution for pricing, order entry, invoicing, and credit. Accurate terms and pricing may reduce customer disputes and improve working capital utilization. Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) provides a basic check and balance that allows the business to consciously determine when and where margin exceptions may be made rather than leaving margin decisions open to the sales force which is often incented only on sales. Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) facilitates consistency between customer expectations and pricing that is ultimately recorded and serves to validate accuracy before producing an invoice, thereby, minimizing collection issues. Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) may address permitted time and conditions of authorized return, price to be credited (e.g., avg. price/period or actual price), freight/handling fees, and required documentation. Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) may ensure an organization can leverage a well defined and controlled returns process consistent w/policy, reduce errors, customer disputes, unauthorized returns, and reverse logistics processing cost. Market leading criteria for âManage sales ordersâ capability 3004 (FIG. 30) may avoid pricing discrepancies between credit memos and customer's deductions, which leads to revenue leakage and follow-up efforts.

 FIG. 38 illustrates capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âmaintain finance system and data structureâ capability 132. Table 20 describes additional market leading criteria for capabilities within the âmaintain finance system and data structureâ capability 132. âMaintain finance system and data structureâ capability 132 may include: âMaintain Enterprise Data Model; Perform Data Governance Activitiesâ capability 3802; and âMaintain Integrated Finance Information Technology Architectureâ capability 3804.
Market leading criteria for âMaintain Enterprise Data Model; Perform Data Governance Activitiesâ capability 3802 may include: implementing a cross functional data model that supports financial and non-financial internal and external; centralizing ownership to achieve and maintain a standardization and consistency; ensuring that corporate controls all master data changes; leveraging formal request template, approval structure, central control, and policy; and defining specific standards that must be met in order to perform a particular operation (e.g., add a new account and cost center); ensuring that all master data elements are used consistently by all entities within the enterprise and use the identical definition; maintaining the master data information in an easily accessible âdata dictionaryâ (e.g., data elements such as customer, product, project, geography, market, contract type, pricing level, and channel). For example, data structures should accommodate an acquisition and/or an internal restructuring without significant manual effort to âmove data aroundâ. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Enterprise Data Model; Perform Data Governance Activitiesâ capability 3802 may include: designing financial performance language (e.g., terms and metrics) that support the key business objectives of the organization; identifying KPIs by which the organization desires to operate the business; designing the financial performance language to enable reporting by the KPIs of the business. Multiple vendor records can lead to inaccuracies in tracking and managing individual vendor activity. Separate records can also lead to separate contracts with different prices and payment terms for identical items. Structured parent-child relationships allow companies to address the situation where they deal with multiple entities within the same vendor company. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Enterprise Data Model; Perform Data Governance Activitiesâ capability 3802 may include: providing major ERP vendors robust vendor master data management capabilities to efficiently produce visibility into global purchasing commitments, spend, and payables balance for each supplier and to maximize buying power and prevent duplicate payments. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Enterprise Data Model; Perform Data Governance Activitiesâ capability 3802 may include: employing consistent nomenclature across business areas and systems; providing the basis to perform analysis on total credit exposure and customer segmentation in reporting, analysis, and collections; employing robust and consistent definitions for all key metrics, assets, and decision support information requirements; defining unit of measure, formula, data source, frequency, and dimensions; and ensuring consistent use of a performance language dictionary to eliminate or minimize debate about straightforward measures. For example, implement a standard âmake vs. buyâ analysis template and/or a standard âcapital project approval requestâ document.
Market leading criteria for âMaintain Integrated Finance Information Technology Architectureâ capability 3804 may include: leveraging a single ERP system across all geographies and business units. A complex IT architecture is a significant driver of cost (e.g., excess data gathering, reconciliation, data entry, and IT maintenance) and a barrier to optimized process design. Market leading criteria for âMaintain Integrated Finance Information Technology Architectureâ capability 3804 may include: employing best of breed data warehouse and planning, reporting and analytic tools superior to the functionality offered within ERP systems; and integrating the tools with the ERP system; implementing online, dashboard style presentation of key data; customizing dashboards for all key executives and delivered directly via the financial systems; implementing dashboards with simple user interfaces; ensuring the use of single, best of breed reporting and analysis application consistently throughout the organization; and ensuring the use of spreadsheets are used as âsupplementsâ rather than primary finance analysis tools.

Target Setting 136


 




 




Description:
Target Setting refers to the process of analyzing the 


 
portfolio of businesses that make up the enterprise and 


 
the expected contribution of each, setting top down 


 
performance targets, and then cascading or assigning those 


 
targets to segments of the business.

210
a high return on invested capital and those earning a low 


 
return


Competitive
Distinction is made between high and low returning assets


Criteria:
when setting targets, but without the full rigor of a portfolio


212
value assessment


Market Leading
Portfolio is fully analyzed to identify opportunities to 


Criteria:
redeploy resources from assets that are not returning the 


214
cost of capital to higher-return assets

Criteria:
or other external benchmark; but âtarget negotiationâ still


212
allowed


Market Leading
Targets predetermined based on external market


Criteria:
expectations. Relative targets (compared to some external


214
benchmark) instead of absolute targets




Link to Strategic Planning

 FIG. 40 illustrates capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the target setting capability 136. Table 24 describes additional market leading criteria for the capabilities of the target setting capability 136, including criteria for: Perform Portfolio Value Assessmentâ capability 4002; âSet Targets for Key Measures of Accountabilityâ capability 4004; âCascade Targets Throughout the Organizationâ capability 4006; and âOngoing Target Review & Managementâ capability 4008.
Market leading criteria for âPerform Portfolio Value Assessmentâ capability 4002 may include: designing and implementing at the onset of the target setting process, a clear governance structure to support the necessary activities with the process; and analyzing the portfolio of business units, project, and assets to identify opportunities to redeploy resources from assets that are not returning the cost of capital to higher-return assets.
Market leading criteria for âSet Targets for Key Measures of Accountabilityâ capability 4004 may include: tightly integrating target setting to strategic planning and resource allocation; deriving targets from the strategy setting process; leveraging external benchmarks and minimum market expectations of returns (e.g., a cost of capital return on enterprise value over the industry lifecycle); preventing the negotiation of targets based on bottom-up budgets; driving targets based on the financial performance necessary to meet shareholder value objectives, rather than âwhat management believes can be achievedâ under a business as usual scenario and/or âlast year+10%â approach; ensuring that targets âadd upâ to the performance necessary to achieve shareholder value objectives; separating targets from shareholder value objectives to de-politicize the process and improve speed and accuracy; and leveraging external and/or industry benchmarks.
Market leading criteria for âCascade Targets Throughout the Organizationâ capability 4006 may include ensuring that each unit earns an appropriate return on capital allocated to the unit.
Market leading criteria for âOngoing Target Review & Managementâ capability 4008 may include: focusing on closing the gaps between target performance and bottom up estimates through action plans and changes to performance, rather than re-negotiating targets; reviewing targets during the year to focus on how successful each business unit is in closing the gaps; assigning managers accountability for meeting those targets over which the manager has control, and compensating managers accordingly from an incentive compensation perspective; maintaining a strategic focus (e.g., forward looking) approach that is analytically driven and provides better insight into the target review process by requiring executives to quickly identify where and when to initiate corrective action in the event targets are not being met; requiring managers to focus on targets, even where bottom-up budgets do not reconcile to the targets; and comparing performance against top-down targets to maintain and adjust detailed budgets as necessary without altering targets.

 FIG. 41 illustrates capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âPlanning, Resource Allocation & Forecastingâ capability 138. Table 26 describes additional market leading criteria for the capabilities of the âPlanning, Resource Allocation & Forecastingâ capability 138, including criteria for: âDevelop Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4102; âPerform Capital Planning/Resource Allocationâ capability 4104; âReview, Challenge, and Finalize Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4106; and âPerform Periodic Forecastingâ capability 4108.
Market leading criteria for âDevelop Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4102 may include identifying and quantitatively testing in advance, business drivers (current and future, financial and operational) and driver based planning models. Market leading criteria for âDevelop Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4102 may include: planning activities focused on estimating values for the drivers instead of âdetail roll-upâ work to enable scenario planning and predictive modeling; creating budgets focused on the highest material and volatile drivers, key metrics, and P&L line items, with only limited focus on other items; developing near term plans and forecasts with more details, and longer term plans with fewer details; developing plans with more detail for material and/or volatile drivers and result measures, and fewer details for immaterial and/or stable drivers and result measures; employing planning tools that are more than roll-up and consolidation tools; employing models built directly in the tool to minimize maintenance, testing, standardization and control, rather than a collection of offline spreadsheets; employing a 4 or 6 quarter rolling horizon for planning and/or forecasting; ensuring that the entire organization uses the same tool for target setting, planning, budgeting, forecasting, and management reporting. Market leading criteria for âDevelop Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4102 may include creating multiple scenarios based on likely variation in key business drivers, rather than a single plan and forecast; employing a planning tool that includes workflow and online review, edit and approval functionality so budget documents do not have to be routed manually (e.g., eliminate the need to e-mail documents); distributing a comprehensive set of planning assumptions (e.g., benefits cost per employee) in advance of the planning process (e.g., benefits cost per employee and average salary increases); and embedding planning assumptions in the planning tool and presenting targets, prior year actuals and most recent forecast using the tool.
Market leading criteria for âPerform Capital Planning/Resource Allocationâ capability 4104 may include: designing planning process to help the enterprise achieve targets and implement strategy; enabling planning to be performed beyond the current fiscal year, eliminate tying compensation to meeting an annual budget; employing a rolling business planning process that is dynamic and focused on reallocating resources to drive business performance; streamlining processes and technology to decrease the number of required resources needed to support the planning process and enable the resources to be allocated where they can contribute the most value; and identifying process efficiencies that yield headcount reductions.
Market leading criteria for âReview, Challenge, and Finalize Plans and Budgetsâ capability 4106 may include: eliminating and/or preventing argument and negotiation among different layers of management about what is going to be achieved and the composition of the budget; and conducting period reviews during the year that focus on how successful each business unit is in closing budget gaps.
Market leading criteria for âPerform Periodic Forecastingâ capability 4108 may include: forecasting a 4 to 6 quarter rolling horizon; and creating a ârhythmâ of updating existing forecast information and adding a month/quarter with each update. Business drivers (current and future, financial and operational) and driver based models are identified and quantitatively tested in advance. Forecasting activities may focus on estimating values for the drivers instead of âdetail roll-upâ work, which enables scenario planning and predictive modeling.

 FIG. 42 illustrates capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the âPerformance Reporting and Analyticsâ capability 140. Table 28 describes additional market leading criteria for the capabilities of the âPerformance Reporting and Analyticsâ capability 140, including criteria for: âMeasure, Report, and Analyze Business Performanceâ capability 4202; âMaintain Common Performance Language and Definitionsâ capability 4204; âProvide On-going Reporting & Analytical Supportâ capability 4206; and âReview Impact of Management Incentive Structure on Financial Performanceâ capability 4208.
Market leading criteria for âMeasure, Report, and Analyze Business Performanceâ capability 4202 may include: the measurement and management of key value drivers and metrics as a primary focus, rather than subordinate to traditional earnings measures and accounting ratios; and identifying the critical few measures that are balanced and aligned with strategic objectives and value creation. Market leading criteria for âMeasure, Report, and Analyze Business Performanceâ capability 4202 may include: employing a shareholder value measure or a proxy thereof incorporating cash flow, invested capital and risk as a key result measure of financial performance; employing other result measures that directly impact the overall shareholder value measure; employing metrics that form a cascading hierarchy, where more detailed metrics are components of more summary metrics; ensuring that the reporting process includes trending and root cause analysis as key components; ensuring that information is captured and reported quickly and consistently for all levels and all parts of the business; ensuring the use of common data models (e.g., customer, product, project, geography, market, contract type, pricing level, and channel).
Historically, value was heavily tied to tangible assets. However, currently only 25% of the S&P 500's value can be traced to tangible assets with the balance largely attributed to intangible value. Market leading criteria for âMeasure, Report, and Analyze Business Performanceâ capability 4202 may include: employing balanced scorecards that reflect tangible and intangible valuations; employing customized dashboards for all key executives and delivered directly via the financial systems; employing reporting content focused on the critical few financial and non-financial metrics and value drivers that align with overall organization objectives; employing online, dashboard style presentation of key data; employing a single, best of breed reporting and analysis application used consistently throughout the organization. The single, best of breed reporting and analysis application may directly access financial and operational data with drill-down capability. Market leading criteria for âMeasure, Report, and Analyze Business Performanceâ capability 4202 may include: employing a standardized process to review reports on a bi-annual or annual basis and pro-actively make decisions to add, change, or eliminate reports based on the current reporting needs of the business; eliminating unused and non-value added reports; ensuring that management spends more time looking forward than backward (e.g., related to pricing, new products, and geographical expansion); ensuring that analysts within the organization spends relatively little time on historical variance analysis, traditional ratio analysis (e.g., automate historical variance analysis); ensuring that each metric corresponds to a formal target and a pre-defined tolerance range; conducting root cause analysis and corrective action when out of tolerance; developing customized scorecards, reporting and analytics for executives responsive to the executives respective scope of responsibility; providing reporting and analytics in real-time, as needed to support decisions; ensuring a primary group is involved in acknowledgement, evaluation and management of risk; ensuring a secondary group views reports for informational purposes only.
Market leading criteria for âMaintain Common Performance Language and Definitionsâ capability 4204 may include: employing robust and consistent definitions for all key metrics, assets, and decision support information requirements; addressing unit of measure, formula, data source, frequency, and dimensions; and ensuring the consistent use of a performance language dictionary to eliminate and/or minimize debate performance measures. For example, a standard âmake vs. buyâ analysis template or a standard âcapital project approval requestâ document. Model should be cross functional, financial and non-financial, internal and external.
Market leading criteria for âProvide On-going Reporting & Analytical Supportâ capability 4206 may include: employing a standardized process; whereas, the company reviews reports on a bi-annual or annual basis, and pro-actively makes decisions to add, change, and/or eliminate reports based on the current reporting needs of the business.
Market leading criteria for âReview Impact of Management Incentive Structure on Financial Performanceâ capability 4208 may include: reviewing current value and future value; using a measure of value (e.g., economic value analysisâEVA) as the primary incentive metric; evaluating the use of non-financial metrics (e.g., customer and/or employee) to provide a balanced perspective to compensation and may influence a different set of behaviors that may prove beneficial for the organization; analyzing incentives for performance measured strictly by short-term financial metrics to determine whether a linkage exists to the creation of long-term shareholder value; implementing performance payout reserves and/or bonuses based on sustained performance over time (e.g., multi-year targets and âbonus bankâ); evaluating and/or eliminating incentives to âshift performance between yearsâ; removing disincentives to high performance; ensuring a line-of-sight with strategy; and ensuring board and management alignment on incentive pay, and encouraging cooperation across organizational entities.

Table 32 provides an explanation of the financial risk management capability 150, key assessment areas within the capability and corresponding performance capability criteria. FIG. 47 illustrates capabilities within the finance process excellence framework multi-level hierarchy corresponding to the financial risk management capability 150.
Market leading criteria for financial risk management capability 150 may address a variety of enterprise-wide risks, including: business risk; operational risk; credit risk which refers to the possibility of loss due to default by a counter-party or customer; and market risk which represents the possibility of loss due to adverse movement in market prices. Market leading criteria for financial risk management capability 150 may address: liquidity risk arising from the possibility of failure to meet short-term cash commitments. Foreign Exchange/Currency Risk is a specific example of market risk that represents the possibility of loss to movement in foreign exchange rates. Business risk is the risk of adverse outcomes due to competitive pressures and/or poor decisions concerning strategy, products, markets, and structures. Operational risk is defined as the exposure to loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. Regulatory/Compliance Risk addresses failure to meet compliance/regulatory requirements resulting in financial penalties and/or reputation damage. Legal Risk arises when an organization becomes subject to financial loss and/or reputation damage as a result of legal actions brought against the company.

 FIG. 5 shows a multidimensional industry performance reference set 500 (âreference set 500â that is also referred to as the âcapability detail poolâ) that provides a capability detail pool from which the system described below may obtain benchmarking tables for a business. The reference set 500 includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables (âreference tablesâ), two of which are labeled 502 and 504. Each reference table may provide the benchmarking criteria for a specific capability, such as those noted above with respect to FIG. 1.
One dimension of each table may establish a âBasicâ performance capability level 210 specifying âBasicâ finance function performance assessment criteria, a âCompetitiveâ performance capability level 212 specifying âCompetitiveâ finance function performance assessment criteria, and a âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level 214 specifying âMarket Leadingâ finance function performance assessment criteria. Another dimension of each table may specify one or more key assessment areas (KAAs), several of which are labeled 506, 508, and 510. As noted above, performance capability criteria, e.g., the PCC 512, populates each key assessment performance reference table to provide benchmark criteria for âBasicâ, âCompetitiveâ, and âMarket Leadingâ characteristics.
The reference set 500 represents the FF-HPCA model 100. Consistent with the FF-HPCA model 100, the reference set 500 may organize multiple reference tables into a hierarchical structure defining discrete changes in granularity. In one implementation, the hierarchical structure includes reference tables, sub-platforms, platforms, and models. FIG. 5 labels three sub-platforms 514, 516, and 518. With reference to FIG. 1, examples of sub-platforms include finance function management platform 104, finance and accounting operations platform 106, enterprise performance management platform 108, corporate finance platform 110, and enterprise risk management platform 112. The reference set 500 may further organize the sub-platforms into platforms, two of which are labeled 520 and 522. Platforms aggregate into the FF-HPCA model 100 and corresponding reference set 500. Additional, different, or fewer levels of granularity may be defined in the FF-HPCA model 100.
The reference set 500 may dynamically populate the reference tables with the most up-to-date performance capability criteria, for example upon retrieval and presentation by a business analysis consultant. The performance capability criteria may be retrieved from a performance capability criteria database or other information source.
 FIG. 5 also shows an example of a database implementation 524 of a portion of a reference table. In particular, the database implementation 524 includes records (e.g., the records 526, 528, 530) that establish each PCC. In the example shown in FIG. 5, each record includes a PCC field 532, a Capability Specifier field 534, a KAA specifier field 536. Other fields may be provided, such as a reference table assignment field or reference set assignment field. The records categorize each PCC into a specific category (e.g., Basic), into a specific KAA, and, optionally, into a specific reference table in a specific reference set for any particular FF-HPCA model.
 FIG. 6 shows a high performance capability assessment system (âsystemâ) 600. The system 600 includes a processor 602 and a memory 604. Several databases support the operation of the system 600, including a performance capability database 606, a performance measured database 608, a capability detail pool database 610, and an assessment results database 626. The system 600 may include a local display 612 and input/output interfaces 617 (e.g., including a keyboard, mouse, microphone, speakers, or other device), and, through the communication interface 614 and networks 616, may communicate with remote devices 618 and remote displays 620. The networks 616 may be any combination of external networks (e.g., the Internet) and internal networks (e.g., corporate LANs). The displays 612 and 620 may, for example, present performance capability assessment models 622 that the system 600 retrieves from the capability detail pool database 610 for review, modification, and application by process engineers or other individuals. With regard to local access or access by the remote devices 618, the system 600 may include a login processing program 624 to authenticate and/or authorize access to the system 600. To that end, the login processing program 624 may include username/password verification, private/public key encryption, or other validation and data protection capabilities.
In one implementation, the performance capability database 606 stores performance capability criteria. As will be described in more detail below, the system 600 may populate performance capability assessment models with performance capability criteria suited to any particular platform (e.g., vision and strategy platform 102, core functions platform 104 and support functions platform 106) and business capability at one or more capability levels across one or more key assessment areas. The performance measured database 608 may store the determined, measured, or otherwise ascertained characteristics, criteria, and other measured data of a particular key assessment area as representative practice data 648. The representative practice data 648 may be obtained through interviews with process engineers, through online questionnaires, through manual or automated analysis of business data (e.g., year end operating reports), or in other manners. The capability detail pool database 610 stores the capability detail pool 500, which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models 622. The assessment results database 626 stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.
The system 600 facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (âmanipulation logicâ) 646 within the system 600 creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data 628 in the memory 604. The manipulation logic 646 may establish capability assessment data 628 in the memory 604, including a capability assessment data structure 630 with multiple capability levels (âCLâ) 632 organized along a capability scale dimension, multiple key assessment areas (âKAAâ) 634 organized along a key factor dimension, and performance capability criteria (âPCCâ) 636 that populates the performance capability assessment model 630. The manipulation logic 646 may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic 652 that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, modify existing performance capability assessment models, delete performance capability assessment models, or retrieve performance capability assessment models for review. In one implementation, the manipulation logic 646 establishes the capability assessment data structure 630 to include a multidimensional finance function performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ performance capability level, a âCompetitiveâ performance capability level and a âMarket Leadingâ performance capability level.
The capability assessment data 628 may also include a capability position specifier 638. The capability position specifier 638 may record the capability level along the performance capability scale 216, as determined for any particular capability. Thus, the system 600 may store the capability level in the assessment results database 626 or elsewhere for future retrieval and review.
In one implementation, the data population logic 640 may be a data population program executed by the processor 602 that populates template performance capability assessment models. For example, the data population logic 640 may include input logic 650 that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 640 may include query logic 645 that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.
In one implementation, as an example, the query logic 645 may receive an input specifying a finance function area and finance function key assessment area with the finance function area for analysis. The query logic 645 searches the multidimensional finance function performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the finance function area and the finance function key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.
The data population logic 640 may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 640 produces populated performance capability assessment models 642 that may be stored in the capability detail pool database 610.
In addition to the analysis process described above, the system 600 may provide an automated analysis of representative practice data 648 that identifies relevant performance capability criteria and determines the position on the performance capability scale 216 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria for the representative practice data 648. As one example, the system 600 may implement capability assessment logic 644 that includes comparison and/or matching logic that analyzes the representative practice data 648 with respect to performance capability criteria to locate key assessment areas for which the system 600 can determine capability levels to obtain a resultant performance capability level for each key assessment area.
Furthermore, the capability assessment logic 644 may determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 216, shown in FIG. 6 as the capability position specifier 638, for a capability under examination given the knowledge of where the key assessment areas corresponding to the capability under examination fall in each capability level. Thus, for example, the capability assessment logic 644 may determine an overall capability level for a capability corresponding to the capability level for the majority of the key assessment areas, or it may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the performance capability scale 216 for a capability. As another example, the capability assessment logic 644 may implement an expert system (e.g., based on a neural network trained on prior determinations) that analyzes the determined characteristics with respect to the performance capability criteria and ascertains where the capability under examination falls along the performance capability scale 216 for each of the key assessment areas, or overall on the performance capability scale 216.
 FIG. 7 shows a flow diagram 700 for creating performance capability assessment models. The performance capability assessment model creator (e.g., the manipulation logic 646) establishes a key factor dimension for the performance capability assessment model (702). As one specific example, the performance capability assessment model creator establishes, in the key factor dimension, key assessment areas: a new product development key assessment area 130, a engineering key assessment area 132, a product lifecycle management key assessment area 134, a procurement strategy key assessment area 136, a strategic sourcing and category management key assessment area 138, a requisition to pay key assessment area 140, a supplier relationship management key assessment area 142, a production forecasting planning and scheduling key assessment area 144, a inbound logistics key assessment area 146, a manufacturing and assembly key assessment area 148, and a outbound logistics key assessment area 150.
The performance capability assessment model creator also establishes a capability scale dimension for the performance capability assessment model (704). The capability scale dimension may define a scale of increasing organizational capability. For example, the structure creator may create a âBasicâ capability level 210, a âCompetitiveâ capability level 212, and a âMarket Leadingâ capability level 214.
The performance capability assessment model creator also populates the performance capability assessment model with performance capability criteria (706). A capability detail pool 500 may be formed to hold multiple tailored key assessment performance reference tables (708). The performance capability assessment model creator may store the populated assessment structure in the capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and analysis (710).
 FIG. 8 shows a flow diagram 800 for retrieving and applying performance capability assessment models. A selection of a capability to be analyzed is obtained (802). In one implementation, the system 600 receives input data that specifies a finance function area and a finance function key assessment area for analysis. For example, the system 600 may accept input from a business consultant that specifies a capability for analysis. The system 600 may query the capability detail pool 500 for a corresponding performance capability assessment model (804). The corresponding performance capability assessment model may be pre-defined in the capability detail pool 500, or the data population logic 630 (or other actor) may populate a performance capability assessment model template that the system 600 newly creates, or that the system 600 retrieves from a data store, such as the capability detail pool database 610.
In another example, the system 600 searches the multidimensional finance function performance reference set (e.g., capability detail pool) 500 for a matching key assessment performance reference table based on the input data that specifies a finance process excellence platform and finance process excellence key assessment area. The system 600 retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table and initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance capability level for the finance process excellence key assessment area.
The system 600 obtains representative practice data 648 for the capability under examination in the specific business under review (806). For example, a business consultant may interview the business to determine how the business currently executes the capability under review. As another example, a representative from the business may complete a questionnaire, submit business data for analysis and parameter extraction, or otherwise provide the characteristics of their current capability execution. As a further example, the system 600 may retrieve the representative practice data 648 from a database of previously obtained representative practice data.
The system 600 compares the representative practice data 648 to the performance capability criteria in the performance capability assessment model (808). For example, a business consultant may use their expertise to arrive at a determination of capability level for the business and the capability under examination (810). Alternatively or additionally, the capability assessment logic 644 may perform an automated analysis of the assessment results data in the assessment results database 626 and ascertain the capability level on the performance capability scale 216 (810). The system 600 may store the assessment results, including the determined capability level, for future reference in the assessment results database 626 or other location (812).
 FIG. 9 shows a flow diagram 900 for analyzing representative practice data 648 to determine a key assessment area to which the representative practice data applies. The system 600 receives representative practice data 648 as input data (902). The system 600 may receive the representative practice data 648 from a database query performed by the query logic 645 that the query logic 645 executes periodically, when instructed by an operator, and/or automatically against any number of available database sources that store representative practice data 648. The capability assessment logic 644 analyzes the representative practice data 648 to identify performance capability criteria in the capability detail pool 500 that the capability assessment logic 644 determines relevant to the representative practice data 648 (904). For example, the capability assessment logic 644 may compare and/or match the content of the representative practice data 648 with the performance capability criteria using natural language processing (NLP), text string and/or substring matching, by comparing tags linked to the representative practice data 648 and that specify that any portion of the representative practice data 648 is applicable to a specific PCC, by querying for a manual classification of the representative practice data 648 to a PCC, or other matching technique. The capability assessment logic 644 may score and/or weight a performance capability criteria and compare the score and/or weight to a user specified relevance threshold to rank the relevance of the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 648 (906). The user may specify particular terms and/or phrases to search and match between the performance capability criteria and the representative practice data 648, in order to score the performance capability criteria.
The capability assessment logic 644 may determine, based on the number of performance capability criteria that meet or exceed the relevance threshold, that the capability assessment logic 644 has identified a sufficient number of performance capability criteria for a specific key assessment area in order to determine a performance capability level for the capability as a whole or any key assessment area within the capability (908). As one example, where at least 51% of the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area meet or exceed the relevance threshold, the capability assessment logic 644 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 648. In another example, the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area may be ranked in importance and/or designated as mandatory in order to assess the key assessment area. In the event the capability assessment logic 644 identifies the mandatory performance capability criteria for a key assessment area the capability assessment logic 644 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 648.
The capability assessment logic 644 may apply the performance capability criteria meeting or exceeding the relevance threshold to the representative practice data 648 to determine whether any particular PCC is met. Accordingly, as the capability assessment logic 644 analyzes the PCC, the system 600 tracks the best fit of the representative practice data 648 to the PCCs in the key assessment performance reference tables. In other words, the system 600 determines how the representative practice data 648 meets (or does not meet) each PCC, thereby gaining insight into whether the representative practice data 648 is indicative of Basic, Competitive, or Market Leading practices.
The system 600 may also gauge the position on the performance capability scale 216 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria (910). The capability assessment logic 644 may further determine an overall position on the performance capability scale 216 for a capability (912). The capability assessment logic 644 may established that a desired number and/or designated mandatory performance capability criteria for the key assessment areas have been identified as relevant to a capability and sufficient to determine the position on the performance capability scale 216 for the capability. For example, the capability assessment logic 644 may determine an overall capability level for the capability based on the capability level determined for the majority of the key assessment areas. The capability assessment logic 644 may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the performance capability scale 216 for the capability.
Although selected aspects, features, or components of the implementations are depicted as being stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as computer-executable instructions or performance capability assessment models), all or part of the systems and structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include, for example, secondary storage devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs; a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received at an antenna; or other forms of memory, including ROM or RAM, either currently known or later developed.
Various implementations of the system may include additional or different components. A processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The processing capability of the system may be distributed among multiple system components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may implemented in many ways, including data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms. Programs may be combined or split among multiple programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.
The FF-HPCA model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the finance functions of organizations. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the FF-HPCA model, including the criteria noted in Tables 1-34 above, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes specific processes to improve, and how to improve the process and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.
While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents.
