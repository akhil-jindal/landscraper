BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
This disclosure concerns a system and method to identify the performance of an organization on a scale of mastery across representative capabilities of the organization's industry. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance level of key capability areas within the processes of a consumer goods and services organization.
2. Background Information
Modern consumer goods and services organizations operate in an increasingly challenging environment. To survive, consumer goods and services organizations must adapt to this environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the competitive nature, low profit margins, and foreign competitive challenges of consumer goods and services businesses greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day-to-day basis.
Despite the need for a consumer goods and services organization to meet the challenges of the global marketplace, it is still often the case that the business lacks clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of its core processes. These shortcomings severely constrain the business, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, it can be very difficult to identify specific processes to which improvements may be made, either because the business itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the business frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.
Even if the consumer goods and services business, on its own, could identify one of the many processes that it needs to improve, the business would not necessarily know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether there are any intermediate goals that should be reached along the way. As consumer goods and services businesses struggle to meet the demands of the modern economic landscape, they fail to identify opportunities for maximizing sales and margin improvement, category expansion, multi-channel execution, customer satisfaction improvement, and to reach other important goals.
Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance level of key assessment areas within the processes of an organization.
SUMMARY
A high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model helps consumer goods and services businesses meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance mastery along which the current practices of the business may be located. The HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and performance gaps within business operations. In addition, the HPCA model also helps the business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish performance measures during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate goal. As a result, the business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that maximize the operating budget for optimum outcomes.
The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance mastery scale dimension. The performance mastery scale dimension defines multiple mastery levels. The performance mastery levels form a scale of increasing organizational performance. The scale includes a âBasicâ mastery level, a âCompetitiveâ mastery level, and a âMarket Leadingâ mastery level. Each performance mastery level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of a business.
A business capability can be defined as a bundle of closely integrated skills, knowledge, technologies, and cumulative learning that is exercised through a set of processes and that collectively represents an organization's ability to create value by producing outcomes and results. Capability area does not represent a delineation of organizational responsibilities as the business outcomes of a capability may be the result of a number of cross-functional teams. Capabilities of a business may be grouped into platforms. For example, the HPCA model groups the capabilities of the consumer goods and services industry into six high-level platforms, including a strategy and governance platform, a demand generation platform, a demand synchronization platform, a demand fulfillment platform, an enterprise operations platform, and an insight and decision making platform. Examples of capabilities within the strategy and governance platform, for example, include corporate mission (and values and governance), corporate objectives, corporate strategy, portfolio planning, integrated strategic planning, sales and operations planning, operating model and organization planning, and merger and acquisition planning. Platforms may include sub-platforms, as well as capabilities.
The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example, the demand synchronization platform includes performance capability criteria for integrated demand and supply planning, product lifecycle management, portfolio optimization, and route to market key assessment areas at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.
Other systems, methods, features, and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 shows a high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model 100. The HPCA model 100 specifies six high-level platforms, including a strategy and governance platform 102, a demand generation platform 104, a demand synchronization platform 106, a demand fulfillment platform 108, an enterprise operations platform 110, and an insight and decision making platform 112. The HPCA model 100 is not limited to the form shown in FIG. 1. Instead, the HPCA model 100 may be adapted and modified to fill a wide variety of analysis roles. Additional, different, or fewer platforms may be used in other implementations, with each platform defining additional, different, or fewer capabilities. Each platform includes one or more multiple <platform name> capabilities 130.
The HPCA model 100 establishes a multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels 138, further described below in reference Tables 1-3. The performance levels 138 establish a scale of increasing effectiveness in delivery of each capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ 140 delivery level, a âCompetitiveâ 142 delivery level and a âMarket Leadingâ 144 delivery level. The performance levels establish a scale of mastery 146 along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC). The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level 138 based on a delivery effectiveness position 158 along the scale of mastery 146.
The âBasicâ delivery level 140 specifies âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âCompetitiveâ delivery level 142 specifies âCompetitiveâ performance assessment criteria, and the âMarket Leadingâ delivery level 144 specifies âMarket Leadingâ performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model 100 receives input data that specifies a consumer goods and services business platform (e.g., a consumer goods and services industry area) and a consumer goods and services industry key assessment area for analysis. The HPCA model 100 searches the multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the consumer goods and services industry platform and corresponding industry capability within the platform and the consumer goods and services industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model 100 initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance assessment level for the consumer goods and services industry key assessment area.
Tables 1-3 below provide an explanation of each of the capability levels 140, 142, and 144.



 

 
 



TABLE 1


 


âBasicâ Delivery Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a basic level is indicative of a high 


 
level, unclear, undisciplined, or unsophisticated ability to 


 
execute the capability in a consistent, traceable, and re-


 
peatable manner. For non-core, low priority, new, or early 


 
adoption of certain process capabilities, a basic level may 


 
be acceptable to the organization or the organization may 


 
not have the resources to expand beyond the basic capability 


 
level. A basic level of mastery often indicates that an or-


 
ganization is lagging behind its competitors in its ability to 


 
execute the capability.


 








 

 
 



TABLE 2


 


âCompetitiveâ Delivery Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a competitive level is indicative of a 


 
conservative ability to execute the capability in a fairly con-


 
sistent, traceable, and repeatable manner with proven tech-


 
niques, tools and commonly accepted practices that are 


 
readily available and maintained. This capability mastery 


 
is either a strategic decision by the organization to be a fol-


 
lower or âgood enoughâoperator in many respects or is an 


 
interim step that organizations aspire to move beyond and 


 
achieve a market leading mastery of the given capability. 


 
A competitive level of mastery often indicates that an or-


 
ganization is performing consistently with its competitors 


 
in its ability to execute a capability.


 








 

 
 



TABLE 3


 


âMarket Leadingâ Delivery Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a market leading level is indicative 


 
of a highly detailed, clear, and often iterative and sophis-


 
ticated ability to execute the capability. The market lead-


 
ing practice is the recognized and referenced benchmark 


 
of continuous improvement and high performance for a 


 
given process capability. The leading process capability 


 
has been optimized for efficiency and effectiveness, is 


 
well understood, traceable, and consistently executed to 


 
the point of being competitively differentiated or at the 


 
top level of peer-to-peer comparison.


 





For FIGS. 2-7, the capability under evaluation may be assigned a level of mastery 138 based on the business' position along the scale of mastery 146 (e.g., the âbasic,â âcompetitive,â or âmarket leadingâ delivery level). Performance criteria corresponding to the basic 140, competitive 142 and market leading 144 performance levels populate the HPCA model 100. The performance criteria capture characteristics, and/or other features of the delivery of a capability at a particular performance level. Examples below illustrate performance criteria that provide analysis and benchmarking for consumer goods and services organizations. The HPCA model 100 performance criteria provide a tool for determining where a platform and capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery 146.
For example, business consultants and business process engineers may interview a business or receive data about the business to determine, measure, or otherwise ascertain the characteristics, criteria, and other features of a particular capability implemented within the business. The consultants and engineers may compare the characteristics of the business to the performance criteria in the HPCA model 100 and arrive at an assessment level 138 for the capability under examination. In doing so, for example, the consultants and engineers may identify where the capability under examination falls in terms of the performance level for each key assessment area of a capability and determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability under examination. Performance criteria may populate the HPCA model 100 in whole or in part. Multiple high performance capability assessments may be collected and stored with the performance criteria for future retrieval and possible modification in a capability detail pool, discussed below.
 FIG. 2 shows the strategy and governance platform 102 divided into respective capability areas 202. The strategy and governance platform 102 includes a corporate mission, values and governance capability 220, a corporate objectives capability 222, a corporate strategy capability 224, a portfolio planning capability 226, an integrated strategic planning capability 228, a sales and operations planning capability 230, an operating model and organization planning capability 232, and a merger and acquisition planning capability 234.
 FIG. 3 shows the demand generation platform 104 divided into respective capability areas 302. The demand generation platform 104 includes a category, brand, and consumer strategy capability 320, a channel, customer, and shopper strategy capability 322, an integrated marketing strategy capability 324, a consumer marketing operations and execution capability 326, a trade marketing operations and execution capability 328, and a sales operations and execution capability 330.
 FIG. 4 shows the demand synchronization platform 106 divided into respective capability areas 402. The demand synchronization platform 106 includes an integrated demand and supply planning capability 420, a product lifecycle management capability 422, a portfolio optimization capability 424, and a route to market capability 426.
 FIG. 5 shows the demand fulfillment platform 108 divided into respective capability areas 502. The demand fulfillment platform 108 includes a supply chain strategy and execution capability 520, a sourcing and procurement strategy and execution capability 522, a manufacturing strategy and execution capability 524, a logistics and fulfillment strategy and execution capability 526, and an order and service management capability 528.
 FIG. 6 shows the enterprise operations platform 110 divided into respective capability areas 602. The enterprise operations platform 110 includes a transactional process management for OtC, PtP, RtR, and HtR capability 620, a master data management capability 622, a corporate operations management capability 624, a facilities and real estate management capability 626, and an information systems and technology management capability 628.
 FIG. 7 shows the insight and decision making platform 112 divided into respective capability areas 702. The insight and decision making platform 112 includes an insights and analytics capability 720, and a performance measurement capability 722.
The tables provided in the appendix listing immediately following the abstract, which form part of this disclosure, provide an explanation of the capabilities and corresponding key assessment areas and performance criteria for each capability within the respective platforms. Each capability may include one or more key assessment areas. Each key assessment area may include one or more additional key assessment areas. In other words, a business capability may include sub-capabilities, and therefore, key assessment areas corresponding to the multiple sub-capabilities. The tables in the appendix show specific criteria used to analyze each capability.
 FIG. 8 shows a multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set 800 (âreference set 800â) that provides a capability detail pool from which the system described below may obtain benchmarking tables for a consumer goods and services business. The reference set 800 includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables (âreference tablesâ), two of which are labeled 802 and 804. Each reference table may provide the benchmarking criteria for a specific capability, such as those noted above with respect to FIGS. 2-7.
One dimension of each table may establish the âBasicâ performance level 140 specifying âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âCompetitiveâ performance level 142 specifying âCompetitiveâ performance assessment criteria, and the âMarket Leadingâ performance level 144 specifying âMarket Leadingâ performance assessment criteria. Another dimension of each table may specify one or more key assessment areas (KAAs), several of which are labeled 806, 808, and 810. As noted above, performance criteria, e.g., the PCC 812, populates each key assessment performance reference table to provide benchmark criteria for âBasicâ, âCompetitiveâ, and âMarket Leadingâ characteristics.
The reference set 800 represents the HPCA model 100. Consistent with the HPCA model 100, the reference set 800 may organize multiple reference tables into a hierarchical structure defining discrete changes in granularity. In one implementation, the hierarchical structure includes reference tables, sub-platforms, platforms, and models. FIG. 8 labels three sub-platforms 814, 816, and 818. The reference set 800 may further organize the platforms into sub-platforms, two of which are labeled 820 and 822. Platforms aggregate into the HPCA model 100 and corresponding reference set 800. Additional, different, or fewer levels of granularity may be defined in the HPCA model 100.
The reference set 800 may dynamically populate the reference tables with the most up-to-date performance criteria, for example upon retrieval and presentation by a business analysis consultant. The performance criteria may be retrieved from a performance capability criteria database or other information source.
 FIG. 8 also shows an example of a database implementation 824 of a portion of a reference table. In particular, the database implementation 824 includes records (e.g., the records 826, 828, 830) that establish each PCC 812. In the example shown, each record includes a PCC field 832, a category specifier field 834, and a KAA specifier field 836. Other fields may be provided, such as a reference table assignment field or reference set assignment field. The records categorize each PCC into a specific category (e.g., Basic), into a specific KAA, and, optionally, into a specific reference table in a specific reference set for any particular HPCA model.
 FIG. 9 shows a high-performance capability assessment system (âsystemâ) 900. The system 900 includes a processor 902 and a memory 904. Several databases support the operation of the system 900, including a performance capability database 906, a performance measured database 908, a capability detail pool database 910, and an assessment results database 926. The system 900 may include a local display 912 and input/output interfaces 917 (e.g., including a keyboard, mouse, microphone, speakers, or other device), and, through the communication interface 914 and networks 916, may communicate with remote devices 918 and remote displays 920. The networks 916 may be any combination of external networks (e.g., the Internet) and internal networks (e.g., corporate LANs). The displays 912 and 920 may, for example, present performance capability assessment models 922 that the system 900 retrieves from the capability detail pool database 910 for review, modification, and application by process engineers or other individuals. With regard to local access or access by the remote devices 918, the system 900 may include a login processing program 924 to authenticate and/or authorize access to the system 900. To that end, the login processing program 924 may include username/password verification, private/public key encryption, or other validation and data protection capabilities.
In one implementation, the performance capability database 906 stores performance criteria. As will be described in more detail below, the system 900 may populate performance capability assessment models with performance capability criteria suited to any particular platform (e.g., strategy and governance platform 102, demand generation platform 104, demand synchronization platform 106, etc.) and business capability at one or more capability levels across one or more key assessment areas. The performance measured database 908 may store the determined, measured, or otherwise ascertained characteristics, criteria, and other measured data of a particular key assessment area as representative practice data 948. The representative practice data 948 may be obtained through interviews with business consultants and industrial engineers, through online questionnaires, through manual or automated analysis of business data (e.g., year end operating reports), or in other manners.
The capability detail pool database 910 stores the capability detail pool 800, which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models 922. The assessment results database 926 stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.
The system 900 facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (âmanipulation logicâ) 946 within the system 900 creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data 928 in the memory 904. The manipulation logic 946 may establish capability assessment data 928 in the memory 904, including a capability assessment data structure 930 with multiple capability levels (âCLâ) 932 organized along a scale of mastery dimension, multiple key assessment areas (âKAAâ) 934 organized along a key factor dimension, and performance criteria (âPCCâ) 936 that populates the performance capability assessment model 930. The manipulation logic 946 may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic 952 that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, modify existing performance capability assessment models, delete performance capability assessment models, or retrieve performance capability assessment models for review.
In one implementation, the manipulation logic 946 establishes the capability assessment data structure 930 to include a multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ capability performance level, a âCompetitiveâ capability performance level, and a âMarket Leadingâ capability performance level.
The capability assessment data 928 may also include a capability position specifier 938. The capability position specifier 938 may record the capability level along the scale of mastery 146, as determined for any particular capability. Thus, the system 900 may store the performance level in the assessment results database 926 or elsewhere for future retrieval and review.
In one implementation, the data population logic 940 may be a data population program executed by the processor 902 that populates template performance capability assessment models. For example, the data population logic 940 may include input logic 950 that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 940 may include query logic 945 that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.
In another implementation, for example, the query logic 945 may receive an input specifying a consumer goods and services industry area and a consumer goods and services industry key assessment area with the consumer goods and services industry area for analysis. The query logic 945 searches the multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the consumer goods and services industry area and the consumer goods and services industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.
The data population logic 940 may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 940 produces populated performance capability assessment structures 942 that may be stored in the capability detail pool database 910.
In addition to the analysis process described above, the system 900 may provide an automated analysis of representative practice data 948 that identifies relevant performance capability criteria and determines the position on the scale of mastery 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria for the representative practice data 948. As one example, the system 900 may implement capability assessment logic 944 that includes comparison and/or matching logic that analyzes the representative practice data 948 with respect to performance capability criteria to locate key assessment areas for which the system 900 can determine capability levels to obtain a resultant performance level for each key assessment area.
Furthermore, the capability assessment logic 944 may determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 as the capability position specifier 938, for a capability under examination given the knowledge of where the key assessment areas corresponding to the capability under examination fall in each capability level. Thus, for example, the capability assessment logic 944 may determine an overall capability level for a capability corresponding to the capability level for the majority of the key assessment areas, or it may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for a capability. As another example, the capability assessment logic 944 may implement an expert system (e.g., based on a neural network trained on prior determinations) that analyzes the determined characteristics with respect to the performance capability criteria and ascertains where the capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery 146 for each of the key assessment areas, or overall on the scale of mastery.
 FIG. 10 shows a flow diagram 1000 for creating performance capability assessment models. The performance capability assessment model creator (e.g., the manipulation logic 946) establishes a key factor dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1002). The performance capability assessment model creator also establishes a capability scale dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1004). The capability scale dimension may define a scale of increasing organizational capability. For example, the structure creator may create the âBasicâ level 140, the âCompetitiveâ level 142, and the âMarket Leadingâ level 144. The performance capability assessment model creator also populates the performance capability assessment model with capability performance criteria (1006). A capability detail pool 800 may be formed to hold multiple tailored key assessment performance reference tables (1008). The performance capability assessment model creator may store the populated assessment structure in the capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and analysis (1010).
 FIG. 11 shows a flow diagram 1100 for retrieving and applying performance capability assessment models. A selection of a capability to be analyzed is obtained (1102). In one implementation, the system 900 receives input data that specifies a consumer goods and services industry area and a consumer goods and services industry key assessment area for analysis. For example, the system 900 may accept input from a business consultant that specifies a capability for analysis. The system 900 may query the capability detail pool 800 for a corresponding performance capability assessment model (1104). The corresponding performance capability assessment model may be pre-defined in the capability detail pool 800, or the data population logic 940 (or other actor) may populate a performance capability assessment model template that the system 900 newly creates, or that the system 900 retrieves from a data store, such as the capability detail pool database 910.
In another example, the system 900 searches the multidimensional consumer goods and services industry performance reference set in the capability detail pool 800 for a matching key assessment performance reference table based on the input data that specifies a consumer goods and services industry platform and a consumer goods and services industry key assessment area. The system 900 retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table and initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance level for the consumer goods and services industry key assessment area.
The system 900 obtains representative practice data 948 for the capability under examination in the specific business under review (1106). For example, a business consultant may interview the business to determine how the business currently executes the capability under review. As another example, a representative from the business may complete a questionnaire, submit business data for analysis and parameter extraction, or otherwise provide the characteristics of their current capability execution. As a further example, the system 900 may retrieve the representative practice data 948 from a database of previously obtained representative practice data.
The system 900 compares the representative practice data 948 to the performance criteria in the performance capability assessment model (1108). For example, a business consultant may use his or her expertise to arrive at a determination of level for the business and the capability under examination (1110). Alternatively or additionally, the capability assessment logic 944 may perform an automated analysis of the assessment results data in the assessment results database 926 and ascertain the performance level on the scale of mastery 146. The system 900 may store the assessment results, including the determined performance level, for future reference in the assessment results database 926 or other location (1112).
 FIG. 12 shows a flow diagram 1200 for analyzing representative practice data 948 to determine a consumer goods and services industry and a consumer goods and services key assessment area to which the representative practice data applies. The system 900 receives representative practice data 948 as input data (1202). The system 900 may receive the representative practice data 948 from a database query performed by the query logic 945 that the query logic executes periodically, when instructed by an operator, and/or automatically against any number of available database sources that store representative practice data 948. The capability assessment logic 944 analyzes the representative practice data 948 to identify performance capability criteria in the capability detail pool 800 that the capability assessment logic 944 determines relevant to the representative practice data 948 (1204). For example, the capability assessment logic 944 may compare and/or match the content of the representative practice data 948 with the performance capability criteria using natural language processing (NLP), text string and/or substring matching, by comparing tags linked to the representative practice data 948 and that specify that any portion of the representative practice data 948 is applicable to a specific PCC, by querying for a manual classification of the representative practice data 948 to a PCC, or other matching technique. The capability assessment logic 944 may score and/or weight a performance capability criteria and compare the score and/or weight to a user specified relevance threshold to rank the relevance of the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 948 (1206). The user may specify particular terms and/or phrases to search and match between the performance capability criteria and the representative practice data 948, in order to score the performance capability criteria.
The capability assessment logic 944 may determine, based on the number of performance capability criteria that meet or exceed the relevance threshold, that the capability assessment logic 944 has identified a sufficient number of performance capability criteria for a specific key assessment area in order to determine a performance level for the capability as a whole or any key assessment area within the capability (1208). As one example, where at least 51% of the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area meet or exceed the relevance threshold, the capability assessment logic 944 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 948. In another example, the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area may be ranked in importance and/or designated as mandatory in order to assess the key assessment area. In the event the capability assessment logic 944 identifies the mandatory performance capability criteria for a key assessment area, the capability assessment logic 944 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 948.
The capability assessment logic 944 may apply the performance capability criteria meeting or exceeding the relevance threshold to the representative practice data 948 to determine whether any particular PCC is met. Accordingly, as the capability assessment logic 944 analyzes the PCC, the system 900 tracks the best fit of the representative practice data 948 to the PCCs in the key assessment performance reference tables. In other words, the system 900 determines how the representative practice data 948 meets (or does not meet) each PCC, thereby gaining insight into whether the representative practice data 948 is indicative of Basic, Competitive, or Market Leading practices.
The system 900 may also gauge the position on the scale of mastery 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria (1210). The capability assessment logic 944 may further determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for a capability (1212). The capability assessment logic 944 may establish that a desired number and/or designated mandatory performance capability criteria for the key assessment areas have been identified as relevant to a capability and sufficient to determine the position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability. For example, the capability assessment logic 944 may determine an overall performance level for the capability based on the performance level determined for the majority of the key assessment areas. The capability assessment logic 944 may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability. Although selected aspects, features, or components of the implementations are depicted as being stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as computer-executable instructions or performance capability assessment models), all or part of the systems and structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include, for example, secondary storage devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs; a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received at an antenna; or other forms of memory, including ROM or RAM, either currently known or later developed.
Various implementations of the system 900 may include additional or different components. A processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The processing capability of the system may be distributed among multiple system components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may be implemented in many ways, including data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms. Programs may be combined or split among multiple programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.
The HPCA 100 model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the consumer goods and services industry. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the HPCA model, including the criteria noted in the Appendix of Tables, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes the specific processes to improve, how to improve said process, and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.
While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents.
