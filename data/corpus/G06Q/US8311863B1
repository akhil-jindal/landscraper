CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application claims the benefit of priority from Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/154,832, entitled Utility High Performance Capability Assessment, filed Feb. 24, 2009, and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
This disclosure concerns a system and method to identify the performance of an organization on a scale of mastery across representative capabilities of the organization's industry. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance capability level of key assessment areas within the processes of a utility organization
2. Background Information
Modern utility organizations operate in an increasingly challenging environment. To survive, utility organizations must adapt to this environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the regularity requirements and resource management challenges of utility businesses greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day-to-day basis.
Despite the need for a utility organization to meet the challenges of the global marketplace, it is still often the case that the business lacks clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of its core processes. These shortcomings severely constrain the business, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, it can be very difficult to identify specific processes to which improvements may be made, either because the business itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the business frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.
Even if the utility business, on its own, could identify one of the many processes that it needs to improve, the business would not necessarily know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether there are any intermediate goals that should be reached along the way. As utility businesses struggle to meet the demands of the modern economic landscape, they fail to identify opportunities for maximizing compliance and margin improvement, category expansion, multi-channel execution, selling performance, customer satisfaction improvement, and to reach other important goals.
Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance level of key assessment areas within the processes of an organization.
SUMMARY
A high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model helps utility businesses meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance mastery along which the current practices of the business may be located. The HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and performance gaps within business operations. In addition, the HPCA model also helps the business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish performance measures during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate goal. As a result, the business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that maximize the operating budget for optimum outcomes.
The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance mastery scale dimension. The performance mastery scale dimension defines multiple mastery levels. The performance mastery levels form a scale of increasing organizational performance. The scale includes a âBasicâ mastery level, a âThresholdâ mastery level, an âAbove Averageâ mastery level, and a âLeadingâ mastery level. Each performance mastery level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of a business.
A business capability can be defined as a bundle of closely integrated skills, knowledge, technologies, and cumulative learning that is exercised through a set of processes and that collectively represents an organization's ability to create value by producing outcomes and results. Capability area does not represent a delineation of organizational responsibilities as the business outcomes of a capability may be the result of a number of cross-functional teams. Capabilities of a business may be grouped into platforms. For example, the HPCA model groups the capabilities of the utility industry into eleven high-level platforms, including a manage retail strategy platform, a manage interaction platform, a manage core operations platform, a manage supply platform, a manage field requests platform, a manage retail insight platform, a customer advocacy platform, a monitor performance platform, a manage compliance platform, a manage quality and performance platform, and a manage third party interaction platform. Platforms may include sub-platforms, as well as capabilities. For example, the manage retail strategy platform may include sub-platforms for manage investments, manage regulatory affairs, manage customer strategy, and manage product/service strategy, where each sub-platform may contain the capabilities.
The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example, the manage investments sub-platform (corresponding to the manage retail strategy platform) includes performance capability criteria for long and medium term planning, investment and analysis, capital and OM budgeting, and investment review key assessment areas, at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.
Other systems, methods, features, and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 shows a utility high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model 100. The HPCA model 100 specifies eleven high-level platforms, including a manage strategy platform 102, a manage interaction platform 104, a manage core operations platform 106, a manage supply platform 108, a manage field requests platform 110, a manage retail insight platform 112, a customer advocacy platform 114, a monitor performance platform 116, a manage compliance platform 118, a manage quality and performance platform 120, and a manage third party interaction platform 122.
The manage strategy platform 102 includes all the capabilities required to strategically assess, formulate, and plan retail operations. The manage interaction platform 104 encompasses the capabilities that manage and operationalize customer contact through multiple touch points. The manage core operations platform 106 encompasses the management of all customer facing activity from attracting, sales activities, and ongoing support throughout the customer lifecycle. The manage supply platform 108 covers forecasting commodity demand and related procurement processes through to settlement. The manage field requests platform 110 covers the ability to manage requests for field services transactions. The manage retail insight platform 112 covers the ability to analyze transactional data to draw insight on customer behavior and corresponding operational implications. The customer advocacy platform 114 covers the treatment of escalated customer issues and recovery efforts. The monitor performance platform 116 provides a balanced and holistic view of retail operation performance. The manage compliance platform 118 provides a system of processes and controls to manage the security of customer information, financial information, compliance with laws and regulations, public relations and the delivery of effective internal operational controls. The manage quality and performance platform 120 encompasses capabilities to support and empower customer care employees at all stages of the employee lifecycle. The manage third party interaction platform 122 encompasses all interactions between a retail utility, vendors, and industry players.
The HPCA model 100 is not limited to the form shown in FIG. 1. Instead, the HPCA model 100 may be adapted and modified to fill a wide variety of analysis roles. Additional, different, or fewer platforms may be used in other implementations, with each platform defining additional, different, or fewer capabilities. Each platform includes one or more multiple capabilities 130 for the various platforms or sub-platforms.
The HPCA model 100 establishes a multidimensional utility industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels 138, further described below in reference Tables 1-3. The performance levels 138 establish a scale of increasing effectiveness in delivery of each capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ 140 delivery level, a âThresholdâ 142 delivery level, an âAbove Averageâ 144 delivery level, and a âLeadingâ 145 delivery level. The performance levels establish a scale of mastery 146 along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC). The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level 138 based on a delivery effectiveness position 158 along the scale of mastery 146.
The âBasicâ delivery level 140 specifies âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âThresholdâ delivery level 142 specifies âThresholdâ performance assessment criteria, the âAbove Averageâ delivery level 144 specifies an âAbove Averageâ performance assessment criteria, and the âLeadingâ delivery level 145 specifies âLeadingâ performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model 100 receives input data that specifies a utility business platform (e.g., a retail utility industry area) and a utility industry key assessment area for analysis. The HPCA model 100 searches the multidimensional utility industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the utility business industry platform and corresponding industry capability within the platform and the utility industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model 100 initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance assessment level for the utility industry key assessment area.
Tables 1-3 below provide an explanation of each of the capability delivery levels 140, 142, 144, and 145.

TABLE 4


 


âLeadingâ Delivery Level


 




 




Description:
Capability mastery at a leading level is more 


 
advanced than most Utilities, an industry leader. 


 
Likely industrialized or standardized to a high degree,


 
competitive strength for the Utility, strong influence

For FIGS. 2-12, the capability under evaluation may be assigned a level of mastery 138 based on the business's position along the scale of mastery 146 (e.g., the âbasic,â threshold; âabove average,â or âleadingâ delivery level). Performance criteria corresponding to the basic 140, threshold 142, above average 144, and leading 145 performance levels populate the HPCA model 100. The performance criteria capture characteristics, and/or other features of the delivery of a capability at a particular performance level. Examples below illustrate performance criteria that provide analysis and benchmarking for utility organizations. The HPCA model 100 performance criteria provide a tool for determining where a platform and capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery 146.
For example, business consultants and business process engineers may interview a business or receive data about the business to determine, measure, or otherwise ascertain the characteristics, criteria, and other features of a particular capability implemented within the business. The consultants and engineers may compare the characteristics of the business to the performance criteria in the HPCA model 100 and arrive at an assessment level 138 for the capability under examination. In doing so, for example, the consultants and engineers may identify where the capability under examination falls in terms of the performance level for each key assessment area of a capability and determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability under examination. Performance criteria may populate the HPCA model 100 in whole or in part. Multiple high performance capability assessments may be collected and stored with the performance criteria for future retrieval and possible modification in a capability detail pool, discussed below.

Regulatory Strategy Management


 




 




Description:
Regulatory Strategy Management defines the process to develop a


 
strategy for meeting regulatory requirements and business needs and


 
ensuring that all operations are aligned to meet the goals of that strategy.


 
The capability includes defining the requirements of a risks and controls


 
program and communication plan for regulators.


Basic Criteria:
Regulatory strategy is inconsistent with attempts to follow and


 
change the regulatorsâ agenda


 
No communication plan in place


 
Strategy is driven by a focus on in-depth understanding of the


 
industry rules rather than on commercial appropriateness


 
Management reacts to regulatory requirements or issues only once


 
they break a particular compliance threshold


 
Internal reporting is based on mandatory regulatory requirements


Threshold Criteria:
Regulatory strategy is consistent but focuses on following the


 
regulators' agenda rather than working collaboratively with other


 
industry parties to instigate change


 
Ad hoc communication plan is in place but there is no formal


 
process for updates


 
Ad hoc response processes are in place but are not consistent


 
Regulatory strategy considers commercial appropriateness - the


 
retailer's position in industry/regulatory league tables are taken into


 
account to ensure strategic programs improve ranking


 
Management might react to regulatory requirements too soon


 
which adds far more costs than benefit


 
Internal reporting is based on mandatory regulatory requirements


 
and a need to understand industry needs/performance


Above Average
Regulatory strategy considers that regulations should be considered


Criteria
in context of commercial decisions, i.e. sometimes it is appropriate


 
to challenge/negotiate terms for new mandatory changes


 
Retailer develops an annual communication plan for regulatory


 
management


 
Management proactively seeks to influence regulatory


 
requirements


 
Internal reporting integrates regulatory compliance with


 
commercial/operational performance


 
Standard processes are in place to respond to regulator requests


 
Retailer effectively self-regulates operations and processes and


 
supports an independent dispute resolution body which is


 
established and financed with the principal function of addressing


 
account and billing disputes where the customer has been unable to


 
resolve the dispute with their retailer.


Leading Criteria:
A holistic approach to regulatory strategy that aligns commercial


 
decisions and industry stakeholders is supported by a multi-channel


 
communication plan that is reviewed on an ongoing basis


 
Retailer employs a wide range of techniques to shape the political


 
and regulatory agenda in order to transform the industry and derive


 
commercial advantage - for example the retailer might initiate and


 
chair critical industry initiatives that bring together peers within the


 
industry


 
Internal reporting integrates regulatory performance with


 
commercial/operational performance is proactively


 
managed/responded to


 
Retailer is able to react to new policies - for example, if the


 
regulator states that retailers should not seek payment from


 
customers where the retailer is at fault for not billing the customer


 
for a certain amount of years, the retailer is able to quickly


 
calculate the effect of this and implement the change to billing as


 
required

communications are mostly uncoordinated


 
Regulatory interfaces are average - the retailer is not usually


 
prepared for negotiations with the proper data and supporting


 
documents


 
Manual monitoring of compliance is often flawed and creates


 
inconsistencies


 
Ineffective, reactionary communication with regulator


Threshold Criteria:
Response to data requests are labor intensive but mostly accurate


 
and therefore the high cost is tolerated and there is no inclination to


 
make changes to the system in place


 
Difficulty in managing to one version of the data and therefore


 
coordinated communication is labor intensive


 
Regulatory interfaces are managed to maintain status-quo relations


 
with no clear process for negotiations

Customer Value and Segmentation


 




 




Description:
Customer Value and Segmentation includes determining the approach


 
and executing customer valuation, profiling and the definition of


 
customer segments for the purposes of differentiated treatment. This


 
capability encompasses all aspects of defining the differentiated


 
customer experience (offerings, communications, pricing, etc) which


 
enables a utility to apply its customer strategy at the individual level.


Basic Criteria:
Customer base not defined in terms of segments or clusters


 
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) not known


 
Customer value strategy is focused on the acquisition of new


 
customers, rather than acquisition and retention due to lack of


 
understanding of relative values within current customer base


 
Customer offer is defined according to product/service availability


 
rather than customer demand modeling


Threshold Criteria:
Customer segments are loosely defined according to logical attributes


 
Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) assessed periodically


 
Strategy is not informed by CLV - for example customer growth


 
targets are focused on the acquisition of new customers, rather than


 
acquisition and retention of high-value customers


 
Simple technology in place for customer profiling provided by an


 
application that is not dedicated to this function and therefore has


 
limited use


 
Profit potential of each segment is not formally evaluated in


 
quantitative terms


 
Customer offers are defined by a balance of product/service


 
availability as well as basic customer segmentation but customer


 
treatments may be similar


 
No standard review of effectiveness of customer value and


 
segmentation approach


Above Average
Target customer base is segmented according to demographic


Criteria
profiles


 
Customer segments are defined according to logical attributes and


 
are sponsored by a segment owner who represents the customers in


 
strategy discussions across the organization


 
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) assessed periodically for defined


 
customer segments


 
CLV per segment is reported to other areas of the organization


 
periodically but data is often difficult to evaluate and does not


 
consistently impact strategy of other retail functions


 
Sophisticated technology in place for customer profiling but this is not 


 
used on a regular basis


 
Profit potential of each segment and cluster is determined by reviewing 


 
revenue against cost to serve


 
Customer offers are driven by segmentation analysis and some


 
differentiated treatment may be available


 
Ad hoc review of effectiveness of customer value and segmentation 


 
approach


Leading Criteria:
Target customer base segmented according to customers' needs,


 
behaviors and demographic profiles


 
Customer segments and clusters defined according to tangible and


 
logical attributes, sponsored by segment owners and tracked


 
according to movement and behavior


 
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is known and maintained for


 
individual customers as well as all defined customer segments and


 
clusters


 
Segment and cluster values are reported to other areas of the


 
organization on a frequent basis to inform strategy for customer


 
acquisition, retention and growth plans, marketing concepts and product 


 
development


 
Sophisticated predictive tools and models used for customer


 
profiling on a regular basis


 
Formal evaluation of ROI per customer segment


 
Customer offers and treatments are defined based on predictive


 
segmentation and unique treatments are available tailored to


 
customer need


 
Regular review of effectiveness of customer value and segmentation

described in subjective terms


 
Brand stretch opportunities are considered and sometimes


 
implemented but without thorough cost/benefit analysis and


 
therefore is perceived as being ineffective


 
Brand measurement is defined in qualitative rather than


 
quantitative terms


 
Brand strategy effectiveness measured at inconsistent intervals


Above Average
Defined brand promise with a tangible value proposition for the


Criteria
customer


 
Brand is sufficiently strong to attract brand stretch opportunities


 
that are taken up when deemed to bring about tangible benefits -


 
these include extending the brand into new markets


 
Brand measurement is defined in quantitative terms and there are


 
distinctions made between brand value and brand loyalty


 
Brand strategy effectiveness measured regularly and ad hoc action


 
taken to adjust brand strategy


Leading Criteria:

Product & Service Development Management


 




 




Description:
Product & Service Development Management covers a retailer's 


 
ability to bring a product to market. Included in this capability is the


 
development of a product itself, i.e. tariff rate structure, various fixed


 
term contracts, sustainable energy offerings, and the delivery of the


 
product via the appropriate channels.


Basic Criteria:
New products/services are investigated and developed in silos on


 
an ad hoc basis


 
Processes for product/service development (concept to pilot) do not


 
include consideration for regulatory requirements so that products


 
are released that are not compliant - e.g. not all products are


 
suitable for vulnerable customers


 
Product or service approval is inefficient leaving other areas of the


 
operation scrambling to accommodate approved products or


 
services at the last minute


 
No capacity for consideration of product/service diversification


 
Products are priced by the associated tariff - there is no formal


 
consideration for discounting or other incentive rules


 
Products rarely contain a corporate social responsibility or


 
sustainability component


 
Products do not promote energy efficiency


Threshold Criteria:
New products/services are investigated and developed


 
systematically, but in silos


 
Product/service development procedures include a regulatory


 
compliance check but compliance is not always enforced


 
Limited capacity for consideration of product/service


 
diversification


 
Products are priced based on a limited set of data and price is only


 
defined in terms of a tariff. Tariff changes are time-consuming and


 
costly and new products frequently require new tariffs


 
Products occasionally contain a corporate social responsibility or


 
sustainability component


Above Average
New products/services are investigated, developed and released


Criteria
according to strategy. Regulatory compliance is ensured at the first


 
stage of development and is a mandatory requirement for


 
development work to start


 
Product development function includes ad hoc searches for


 
product/service diversification opportunities but these are not


 
always carried through to thorough evaluation and therefore seen


 
as a redundant investment


 
Fact-based pricing recommendations and decisions are coordinated


 
between some business units and are primarily driven by


 
competition


 
Products usually contain a corporate social responsibility or


 
sustainability component


Leading Criteria:
Product/services are investigated, developed and released


 
according to strategy and evaluated throughout the development


 
lifecycle through customer analytics


 
Regulatory compliance is ensured at the first stage of development


 
and is a mandatory requirement for development work to start


 
Information on customer values, predicted needs and actual uptake,


 
channel requirements and internal company needs is input for a


 
dedicated product development team


 
Product development is focused on product portfolio optimization


 
and retailer is good at product/service lifecycle management


 
Retailer deploys a center of excellence approach to manage


 
ideation through to commercialization of new products/services


 
across the enterprise


 
Customer centric methodologies (e.g. customer feedback data is


 
fed back into process methodologies)


 
Products align with retailer's stated core values (e.g. always


 
contain a corporate social responsibility or sustainability


 
component)


 
Organization has an integrated, transparent view of


 
products/service lifecycle and plan proactively for product/service

Basic Criteria:
No process in place to understand the current alliance footprint


 
Prospective partners are not fully investigated and impact of the


 
alliance not fully realized prior to contractual commitment


 
Perceived lack of opportunity to benefit from an alliance due to a


 
somewhat introverted product/service strategy


 
Retailer has limited integration partnerships


 
Rationale and business case for the formation of alliances is not


 
clear


 
Alliance is fundamentally not profitable for one or all parties


 
No periodic review of partnerships is conducted


 
Different parts of organization have entered into agreements with


 
vendor/partner at different points in time


Threshold Criteria: 
Ad hoc understanding of current alliance footprint


 
Alliance opportunities are created as a reaction to offers rather than


 
through proactive search/investigation initiatives


 
Alliance is designed to benefit driving party and therefore biased in


 
terms of realized benefits


 
Specific partner information available for manual exchange


 
Alliances and partnerships are strategic but effort is not sufficient


 
to capitalize on the full value potential


 
Alliance is successful in the short-term only and therefore does not


 
promote growth


 
The customer can recognize differences in services based on


 
differing partnership relationships


 
Ad hoc review of partnerships with no real process to measure


 
realized value


Above Average
Standardized process in place to understand current alliance


Criteria
footprint


 
Alliance opportunities are sought/investigated in response to a


 
sudden change in customer base/value rather than as part of a long


 
term strategy


 
Specific partner information available for exchange


 
Alliance is designed to deliver mutual benefits but benefits are not


 
consistently realized/measured


 
Alliances are viewed and managed as medium-term relationships


 
and serve to increase customer base but not customer value


 
The customer experience is delivered uniformly through


 
partnerships, however customers are aware of outsourced services


 
Partnerships and alliances are regularly appraised


Leading Criteria:
Standardized process in place to understand current alliance


 
footprint and assess partnerships on an ongoing basis


 
Alliance opportunities are proactively sought/investigated as part


 
of a long term strategy to meet customer requirements and promote


 
growth in terms of brand value, customer value and market share


 
Partner integration with data and application interface


 
Alliance is designed to deliver mutual specific value-adding


 
capabilities and skills both of which are tangible and proactively


 
evaluated


 
Alliances are viewed and managed as long-term relationships


 
The customer does not recognize the involvement or different


 
brand of partnerships


 
Partnerships and alliances are regularly appraised and measured


 
against a standard set of performance metrics

Inconsistent use of modeling and analysis tools


 
Ad hoc benchmarking against competition


 
Rate descriptions on customer bills tend to be compliant with


 
regulatory requirements


 
Changes to rate/tariffs require system outage due to being hard


 
coded into the CIS/billing system


Threshold Criteria:
Simple rate/tariff structure is developed and released periodically,


 
as opposed to being a continuous activity


 
Segment specific programs are poorly delivered, i.e. uptake is low,


 
schemes are not profitable, customers are still dissatisfied/incurring


 
significant debt


 
Rate/tariff designed and maintained using relevant modeling and


 
analysis tools


 
Rate descriptions are compliant with regulatory requirements


 
although this is still a major source of customer complaints


 
Changes require system outages or significant change requests


 
Periodic benchmarking against other competitors and/or markets


Above Average
Simple rate/tariff structure is designed in line with product


Criteria
strategies


 
Segment specific programs are proactively managed and reviewed


 
(i.e. uptake is controlled, impact on customer base and behavior is


 
monitored)


 
Rate/tariff design and maintenance function is integrated with


 
supply/energy trading systems


 
All rate/tariff development and change is designed to account for


 
external factors


 
Rate descriptions and tariff structures compliant with regulatory


 
requirements


 
Simple rate/tariff changes can be done as a system configuration


 
change


 
Regular benchmarking against other competitors and/or markets


Leading Criteria:

management


 
Creative special payment programs developed which can be


 
tailored to customer segments and clusters


 
Rate/tariff designed and maintained using relevant modeling and


 
complex analysis tools, which are integrated with supply/energy


 
trading systems


 
Dedicated business function responsible for benchmarking


 
offerings against competition


 
Both simple and complex changes to rate/tariffs are enabled as


 
system configuration changes as opposed to system codes changes


 
requiring system outage


 
Ongoing benchmarking against other competitors and/or markets

which channels


 
Most or all customer interactions occur within a single channel


 
(e.g., direct mail, call center, internet, branch, etc.)


 
Key assumption is that all required transactions can be completed


 
in one channel per customer


 
No channel demand management discipline in place


 
Staffing forecasts are based primarily on historical interaction


 
volumes


 
Standard channel technologies (e.g. telephone, e-mail, fax, and


 
correspondence routing/queuing capabilities)


 
Routing of customers can only take place within a single channel


Threshold Criteria: 
Predominant customer contact is via the telephone/agent with


 
measurable channel shift towards IVR/WEB.


 
Customer experience is inconsistent across all channels - access


 
similar customer information


 
Channel definitions exist which specify which service will be


 
distributed over which channels


 
All customers are encouraged equally to utilize all available


 
channels without consideration of customer segmentation - limited


 
channel integration


 
Customer agents are trained and proficient for their specific


 
channel, but are not proficient with other channels


 
Business processes for existing channels are imposed on new


 
channels w/ some modification


 
Introduction of new channels is done reactively without evaluating


 
applicability to industry, brand, and customer segments


 
Channel costs are measured


 
Systems are not designed to support seamless routing of customers


 
between channels - routing is based on static business/decision


 
logic


 
CTI technology enables some calls to be routed to an agent off-site


 
(e.g. home working) but the customer experience is inconsistent


 
and the agent is unable to complete all transactions from home. It


 
is likely that home workers are given very specific calls to handle


 
such as credit queries and complaints where their home


 
environment is better suited to the call


Above Average
Increasing automation within the IVR/WEB channels with the IVR


Criteria
and agent still the predominate choice.


 
Full channel integration enables a consistent customer experience


 
across channels - all channels access the same record of customer


 
information


 
Ability to track, monitor and report on forecasted vs. actual


 
interaction volumes


 
Customer agents are trained and proficient at supporting customers


 
on multiple channels


 
Individual business processes are designed to ensure effective


 
execution of each channel


 
Proactive introduction of new channels based on industry trending


 
Staffing forecasts match agent type with anticipated demand from


 
corresponding customer types


 
Channel costs are well defined and optimal operating levels are


 
understood


 
Dynamic routing business/decision logic is user maintainable and


 
takes into account customer and agent information and availability


 
of resources


 
All channels access the same record of customer information. The


 
web service, call center, and third party all have access to a central


 
data hub that is updated and accessed online


 
CTI technology enables some calls to be routed to an agent off-site


 
(e.g. home working) and returned to a call center and customer


 
experience is consistent across on and off-site locations


 
Traditional reader boards and/or closed circuit TV broadcasts are


 
used to communicate alerts (e.g. news of outages, news headlines,


 
TSL, etc.) to customer-facing agents. Some level of investigation


 
and utilization of integrated desktop applications to provide


 
âtickerâ information for notifications


Leading Criteria:
Increasing utilization of automated channels by the customer (e.g.,


 
40%+) due to well-defined integrated channel strategies, customer


 
segmentation, channel analytics, and customer adoption practices.


 
Channel integration enables a consistent customer experience


 
across all channels and can be tailored for each customer


 
segment/preferences for all channels


 
Extensive cross-channel integration - all channels access the same


 
record of customer information


 
Ability to conference and transfer contacts to remote


 
telecommuting agents - still offering a consistent customer


 
experience


 
Customers are encouraged to utilize appropriate channels based on


 
customer segmentation (value, preferences, etc.)


 
Network-based onscreen agent prompting used for alerts, e.g. news


 
of outages or news headlines


 
Customer interactions are consistent and properly aligned across


 
multiple channels


 
Company proactively assesses and adds new customer channels


 
(e.g. âchatâ)


 
An integrated multi channel strategy is established offering


 
multiple delivery channels with seamless routing


 
All channels access the same record of customer information i.e.


 
the web service, call center, m-Commerce devices (Palm Pilots,


 
cell phones, WAP), and third party all have access to a central data


 
hub that is updated and accessed online. Operations achieving true


 
Single View of the Customer


 
CTI technology enables agents to work from home and offers a


 
consistent customer experience, work via a secure network, and


 
immediate data updates in the central hub with the appropriate


 
levels of security.


 
Enhanced communication and notifications via integrated desktop


 
applications via âtickerâ information or integration with CTI


 
information window. Early investigation and utilization of Instant


 
Messaging solutions amongst supervisors and deployed to select


 
agent groups

Web


 




 




Description:
Channel Management covers the management and 


 
integration of all channels in which customers 


 
contact the utility. It ensures channel efficiency and 


 
effectiveness by ensuring that there are various and


 
correctly oriented methods in place for the customer 


 
to contact the utility.


Basic Criteria:
Website is rarely updated and no minor improvement 


 
assessment has been conducted post launch


 
Basic web functionality (simple menu structures 


 
with informational, account specific, and simple 


 
functionality such as balance enquiries, obtaining 


 
information on payment methods or obtaining credit 


 
agreement details)


 
Website is not robust and rarely used by customers 


 
such that it does not serve as a high-value channel


 
No metrics identified to drive value] from the site or 


 
to gain customer insight


Threshold Criteria:
Website is given minor updates on an infrequent 


 
basis. Customer opinion has not been taken into 


 
consideration when building the site


 
Web functionality includes transactions that are 


 
often requested by customers and do not require 


 
personal interaction (for example, changes to 


 
payment method, name changes and address 


 
changes) - however, these transactions are problematic 


 
if not executed correctly/with the right data and 


 
therefore the website often cannot process the 


 
transaction successfully


 
Basic self-service options are entirely automated and 


 
require no Agent/Back-office intervention. Some 


 
advanced functions such as payment arrangements 


 
and turn on/off are offered but not automated on the 


 
back-end. Basic FAQ deployment and can be


 
difficult to utilize


 
Updated data resulting from web transaction is not 


 
passed to data base immediately


 
Most customer initiated web transactions require 


 
manual processing on the backend due to lack of 


 
backend system integration


 
Website does not serve as a high-value channel, it is 


 
costly to provide, maintain and support


 
Metrics are identified but are rarely tracked


Above Average
Website is on a regular update schedule with major 


Criteria
revisions on an annual basis. Customer input is used 


 
for the design, updates and revisions


 
Web functionality includes transactions which are 


 
best suited to the web (e.g. balance enquiries, meter 


 
read submission and statement requests). While the 


 
scope of transactions is somewhat limited, they are 


 
unlikely to be problematic (i.e. they can be simply 


 
and effectively validated, they can be easily reversed 


 
out of the data base with little/no impact on the 


 
customer account)


 
Web personalization with natural language engine


 
Customer enabled web customization


 
Integration to non-billing legacy applications and 


 
knowledge management


 
FAQ and natural language query capabilities


 
Updates to customer data replicated to central hub 


 
in real time


 
Direct web marketing is enabled according to 


 
customer segment, current campaign and customer 


 
value


 
Website does serve as a good-value channel as it is 


 
relatively inexpensive to provide, maintain and 


 
support but it does not significantly reduce the 


 
workload for front and back office agents


 
Some metrics are identified and tracked to drive 


 
value from the site


Leading Criteria:
Website design includes graphic user interfaces and 


 
regular additions and updates. Customer input and 


 
mass collaboration techniques are used for website 


 
updates


 
Web-based portal provides a coherent set of 


 
account management transactions which involve 


 
complex logic in terms of data validation and 


 
proactive cross-sell attempts. Customers are given 


 
a holistic view of their account and opportunities for 


 
product holding expansion


 
Interactions tailored to individual customer 


 
intelligence & characteristics


 
Interaction with customer insight by behavior 


 
information, value based intelligence, customer 


 
segment


 
Cross-sell & up-sell products (e.g., payment plans, 


 
EE/DR, etc.)


 
3rd party integration such as high-bill analyzers, 


 
etc.


 
Web interaction is used to obtain customer insight 


 
and to tailor the customer experience accordingly, 


 
e.g. customers are not asked the same question more 


 
than once, touch point data is stored and re-used, a 


 
âcall meâ and/or chat facility is available


 
Website is core component of channel strategy


 
Specific set of metrics identified and tracked for 


 
continuous improvement and customer insight

to contact the utility.


Basic Criteria:
All inbound emails are processed manually with no 


 
auto response acknowledgement of receipt


 
Outbound emails can be generated manually and on 


 
an individual basis only - no capability for mass-


 
communication by email - emails are not personalized


 
Customers cannot choose to receive communications 


 
via email


Threshold Criteria: 
All inbound emails are processed manually


 
Outbound emails can be generated for mass-


 
communication but customers cannot choose to 


 
receive communication via email 


 
Email are not generally personalized and if they are, 


 
the personalization is based on standard data only 


 
such as demographics


 
Some early planning to implement Email Response 


 
Management System (ERMS) with consideration of 


 
existing CTI systems


 
Outbound emails can be generated for mass-


 
communication but customers cannot choose to 


 
receive communication via email


 
Simple, text-only functionality


 
No self-managed subscription functionality


 
Frequently asked questions have standard templated 


 
responses which are manually copied and pasted 


 
back to customer inquires


Above Average
All inbound emails are routed automatically and 


Criteria
processed manually - auto response added with very 


 
basic functionality


 
Outbound emails can be generated for mass-


 
communication and customers can choose to receive 


 
communication via email, however this is not always 


 
applied to outbound campaigns


 
Email Response Management System (ERMS) 


 
utilized to provide automated email management, 


 
provide auto acknowledgements, automated 


 
suggestions, and robust web forms. Email requests


 
blended into the agent wok queue with robust 


 
metrics and measures


 
Early planning and investigation of Web Telephony 


 
Integration (WTI) including key functionality: click 


 
to chat, click to call, click to callback, and web 


 
collaboration.


 
Personalization is limited to differing customer 


 
segments and reinforcement with linkages to 


 
customer data is not fully utilized


 
Simple functionality but includes text and graphics


 
Self-managed subscription and referral functionality


 
Limited tracking or reporting available


Leading Criteria:
Inbound emails are routed and allocated to individual 


 
agents automatically and according to required 


 
customer experience, e.g.customer is sent an auto-


 
response to confirm their message has been received 


 
and to advise when the response should be expected


 
Once a customer email has been routed to an agent,


 
their emails will always be routed to the same agent, 


 
pending availability


 
Outbound emails can be generated for mass-


 
communication and customers can choose to receive 


 
communication via email


 
ERMS integration to Billing systems and ancillary 


 
applications to pre-automate certain transactions and 


 
quality of customer data via forms. Utilize screen 


 
pop integration with CTI to bring up Billing 


 
main account screen, and supporting knowledge


 
Limited trails and pilots of basic WTI capabilities to 


 
measure customer utilization and acceptance


 
Personalization is extensive and based on both 


 
customer data and segmentation characteristics


 
Complex functionality including link backs to 


 
websites, Java, and two-way transactional 


 
functionality


 
Self-managed subscription and referral 


 
functionality

Description:
Channel Management covers the management and 


 
integration of all channels in which customers 


 
contact the utility. It ensures channel efficiency 


 
and effectiveness by ensuring that there are various 


 
and correctly oriented methods in place for the 


 
customer to contact the utility.


Basic Criteria:
A local retail outlet/office is offered in major centers 


 
as it is a mandatory requirement by the regulator but 


 
is used by very few customers as a primary channel


 
Local retail outlet has minimum capabilities on offer 


 
due to a lack of skilled staff and facilities - no ability 


 
to make a payment


 
Local retail outlet makes little to no investment in 


 
the Customer Experience


 
A receptionist to direct customers to a telephone 


 
that directs customers to a call centre or somewhere 


 
else to get their questions answered - informational 


 
pamphlets available


 
Local retail outlet/office is a relatively ineffective 


 
channel due to limited opening hours, lack of skilled 


 
resources and high operating costs


 
Local retail outlet does not have the ability to handle 


 
other customer service transactions in off-peak times


Threshold Criteria:
Retail outlet remains but is no longer a commonly-


 
used customer channel and is costly to keep in 


 
operation


 
Retail outlets are not located at convenient locations 


 
for customers


 
Retail outlet has limited capabilities on offer due to 


 
a lack of skilled customer service staff


 
Able to handle basic inquiries (e.g. basic billing 


 
questions)


 
receptionist directs customers to specialized teams 


 
via telephone (e.g. conservation)


 
Customers are restricted by payment methods, e.g. 


 
no cash can be taken or other services, e.g. 


 
notification of home move can be recorded but not 


 
replicated in customer database


 
Limited opening hours and counter staffed by 


 
office workers who are often unavailable


Above Average
Retail outlet is a popular customer channel for those 


Criteria

Threshold Criteria:
Pre-payment is an inappropriate method because 


 
it provides the service at a very high cost


 
Pre-payment data sticks and swipe cards can be 


 
re-credited through self service channels


 
Pre-payment data sticks and swipe cards can be 


 
re-credited at local offices and via customer 


 
service agents


 
Emergency tokens or swipe cards can be 


 
purchased by the customer


 
Reconnect and disconnect via a remote controlled

integration of all channels in which customers 


 
contact the utility. It ensures channel efficiency and 


 
effectiveness by ensuring that there are various and


 
correctly oriented methods in place for the 


 
customer to contact the utility.


Basic Criteria:
Mail the only available channel for customer 


 
correspondence as customer email addresses are not 


 
stored and therefore the email channel is not available


 
Mass mailings of newsletters, coupons, promotions 


 
are conducted


 
Customer address data quality is poor (i.e. there are 


 
no address quality checks before printing and 


 
sending) and therefore outbound correspondence 


 
generates significant volumes of returned mail which 


 
is costly to process


 
Fax used for one way communication from retailer 


 
to deliver basic marketing messages


 
Customer experience is not delivered consistently 


 
across all correspondence


 
Some templates exist for standard letters but the set 


 
is not exhaustive and so some letters are created 


 
by individuals duplicating work and not going 


 
through the appropriate level of quality checks


Threshold Criteria:
Mail is the main channel for customer 


 
correspondence as some customer email addresses 


 
are stored but these are of poor quality and 


 
therefore email channel is not available except 


 
on an exception basis


 
Targeted mass mailings based on customer sign-


 
ups cause increasing skepticism about direct 


 
marketing by post making mail/fax an unpopular 


 
channel


 
Fax used for one way communication from 


 
retailer to deliver marketing messages and 


 
information on conservation and energy


 
efficiency programs


 
Customer address data quality is good (basic address 


 
quality check before printing and sending) and 


 
therefore outbound correspondence generates 


 
manageable volume of returned mail that


 
is costly to process due to ad hoc system in place


 
The use of letter templates attempts to deliver a 


 
consistent customer experience across all 


 
correspondence but this is not generally 


 
consistent with other channels


Above Average
Mail is still the main and most popular channel for 


Criteria
billing as most customer email addresses are stored 


 
when available but due to the fact that many 


 
customers do not provide an email address or


 
require email correspondence, email channel is 


 
not yet cost-effective


 
Targeted and selective mailings are conducted for 


 
newsletters, coupons, and promotions and are 


 
well received by customers


 
Fax used for two-way communication between 


 
retailers and customers for inquiries, marketing 


 
messages, bill processing, and special programs


 
Customer address data quality is very good 


 
(advanced address quality check before printing 


 
and sending using an external address


 
management system) and therefore outbound 


 
correspondence generates only a low volume of 


 
returned mail that is mostly processed on an 


 
exception basis


 
The use of dynamic letter templates and bill 


 
inserts delivers a consistent customer experience 


 
across all correspondence and this is generally


 
consistent with other channels


Leading Criteria:
Mail is no longer a major customer channel for 


 
billing as customer email addresses are stored 


 
when customer requests email correspondence 


 
and electronic correspondence is consistent with


 
the paper versions. Email channel is cost-


 
effective


 
Customers have the ability to print their own 


 
copies of bills


 
Auto-mailing for targeted and selective 


 
newsletters, coupons, and special promotions 


 
that are specifically tailored to individual


 
customer segments. Includes customized bill 


 
messaging for individual segments


 
Fax used for inbound/outbound communication 


 
between retailers and customers for inquiries, 


 
targeted and segmented marketing messages, bill 


 
processing and target special program promotion


 
Customer address data quality is excellent 


 
(advanced address quality check and auto-


 
corrections before printing and sending using an 


 
external address management system) and 


 
therefore outbound correspondence generates a 


 
low volume of returned mail that is processed 


 
efficiently


 
The use of dynamic letter templates and bill 


 
inserts delivers a consistent customer experience 


 
across all correspondence and this is consistent


 
with other channels

Channel Management - Email


Field Sales


 




 




Description:
Channel Management covers the management and 


 
integration of all channels in which customers 


 
contact the utility. It ensures channel efficiency and 


 
effectiveness by ensuring that there are various and


 
correctly oriented methods in place for the customer 


 
to contact the utility.


Basic Criteria:
Field Sales agents are seen as being âpushyâ and 


 
intrusive and therefore negatively impact the 


 
customer experience


 
Field sales agents work with paper forms and 


 
therefore have no online access to customer/


 
prospect records


 
High turnover of agents who are motivated by short-


 
term targets based on the number of contracts signed 


 
and therefore increasing instances of void contracts


 
Channel is effective in terms of reaching prospects 


 
than would not otherwise have been found/


 
contacted, low-cost due to cheap labor and hours/


 
location of work


 
Field sales agents collect basic account sign-up 


 
but do not collect data to be fed back into market/


 
customer analysis, campaign management or after-


 
sales support


Threshold Criteria:
Field sales agents are motivated by individual and 


 
uninterrupted targets and are not encouraged to work 


 
collaboratively with other teams.


 
Fields sales agents experience channel is subject to 


 
high staff turnover and poor employee satisfaction, 


 
both of which impact the customer experience


 
Agents work with paper forms or hand-held devices, 


 
both of which are independent from the central hub 


 
of customer/prospect records and therefore data 


 
cannot be collected/verified or used to identify 


 
opportunities


 
Agents tend to sign-up low-value customers and are 


 
given incentives to acquire rather than retain 


 
customers-there is a significant volume of void 


 
contracts


 
Channel is effective at reaching prospects but is not 


 
effective at targeting high-value customers


Above Average
Field sales agents are given realistic targets and 


Criteria
there is a good level of employee satisfaction within 


 
the teams


 
Agents work with hand-held devices which have 


 
remote access to a central hub of customer/prospect 


 
records and therefore data can be collected/verified 


 
or used to identify opportunities


 
Agents tend to attain low-value customers and are 


 
given incentives to acquire rather than retain (for 


 
deletion or revision to indicate some incentive for 


 
customer retention)


 
The number of void contracts is managed via 


 
auto-validation at data input and a requirement for 


 
authentic customer consent


Leading Criteria:
Field sales agents are given realistic targets which 


 
can be attained by working collaboratively with 


 
other teams


 
Training, performance management and rewards 


 
promote high employee satisfaction and a very 


 
positive customer experience


 
Agents use sophisticated selling techniques to 


 
target high-value customers


 
Agents are rewarded for customer retention as 


 
well as acquisition and void contracts and/or 


 
dissatisfied customers are within target


 
Agents are recognized and rewarded for attracting, 


 
up selling, and returning high-value customers

the functional and technical capabilities to deliver multi-channel and


 
ongoing marketing messages that support customer acquisition, growth


 
and retention objectives.


Basic Criteria:
Ad hoc direct marketing plan developed that focuses on mass


 
marketing


 
No alignment of direct marketing plan with overall strategy and


 
objectives


 
Target lists are not used for marketing campaigns, instead only


 
mass marketing campaigns are conducted


 
Target lists cannot be maintained due to a lack of infrastructure


 
(i.e. no dedicated marketing database)


 
Campaigns are not piloted/tested within a group of customers, they


 
are simply reviewed and approved internally


 
No standard processes for campaign execution


 
No evaluation of campaigns using performance indicators


Threshold Criteria:

strategy


 
Target lists are used for direct marketing campaigns


 
Campaigns are designed for the mass-market rather than for a


 
specific customer type


 
Target lists can be maintained in a dedicated marketing database


 
which simply holds names and addresses rather than other


 
customer data such as communication preferences, behavior,


 
existing product holdings and contact history


 
Databases are not integrated with wider CIS systems and channel


 
management practices


 
Campaigns are piloted/tested within a focus group who are enlisted

Loyalty Management


 




 




Description:
Loyalty Management includes the development, design and


 
implementation of programs to increase customer loyalty through


 
multiple avenues such as acquisition, retention, win-back and the


 
identification and recognition of loyal customer segments and


 
individual customers.


Basic Criteria:
No formal customer loyalty program in place


 
Basic schemes are offered to customers and applied inconsistently


 
Execution of the program is not formalized - customer agents apply


 
simple incentives infrequently and on an ad hoc basis


 
Program is not measured formally


 
Insights are not incorporated into the planning of the loyalty


 
program


Threshold Criteria:
Loyalty program in place and customer segments are identified in


 
terms of value but insight is not actively employed for all relevant


 
channels


 
Competitive environment is not considered in planning the loyalty


 
program


 
Rule-based systems are used to execute program that treat


 
customers in a simplistic sequence of events and do not take the


 
full customer experience into consideration


 
Some customer loyalty incentives are offered but are often poorly


 
administered


 
Programs are monitored infrequently and provide little or no


 
insight on possible improvement measures


 
No integration plan between information collected from the insight


 
capabilities and the loyalty program


Above Average
Developed loyalty programs in place for customers - utilizes


Criteria
customer profitability and cost to serve for planning


 
Competitive landscape is applied on an ad hoc basis during the


 
planning phase


 
Loyalty programs are aligned around customer segments and


 
simple forward looking analytics


 
Synchronized executed delivery of the program around the


 
customer experience using profiles, preferences, segments, values,


 
etc.


 
Loyalty program is not successful at reducing customer switching


 
behavior


 
Programs are monitored on an ad hoc basis using simplistic


 
measures


 
There is little integration planning between real-time analysis and


 
pre-processed scoring for the loyalty program and insight


 
capabilities


Leading Criteria:
Advanced loyalty programs in place for customers addressing

Customer Acquisition


 




 




Description:
Customer Acquisition, also known as registration, is the process of


 
securing a new customer through standard sales channels or through


 
assignment to the retail utility the moment a new account is billable.


Basic Criteria:
Sales capability is independent from the registration capability and


 
has a significant impact on the time taken from customer contract


 
agreement to account creation - means that the sales agent has no


 
view of supply point details at point of sale


 
No formal validation built in to the registration process such as


 
automated address validation


 
Reactive and delayed credit check process


 
Automated bank details validation, identity validation, etc.


 
No integration between Change of Tenancy and Registration


 
processing


 
Change of Tenancy is passed from the registration team to the


 
Change of Tenancy team as an exception


 
Manual communication between suppliers/industry to confirm


 
change of supplier


 
Delay in ability to sign up customers makes it hard to obtain an


 
accurate usage view on move-in


 
Manual discovery of meters for retailer transfers. Market data and


 
CIS system are separate


 
Transfer exceptions are handled manually


Threshold Criteria:
Sales operation is independent from the registration operation but


 
this has very little impact on the time taken from customer consent


 
to active account creation as the teams are integrated and work


 
efficiently together


 
Sales teams have an out of date view of supply point details at


 
point of sale and therefore cannot validate meter details and read at


 
point of entry


 
Some formal validation built into the registration process such as


 
automated address validation, automated bank details validation,


 
identity validation, etc.


 
Manual credit check process


 
Validation steps often cause bottlenecks in the process as


 
exceptions are handled manually and input data is of a poor quality


 
Some automated communication between suppliers/industry parties


 
to confirm change of supplier via workarounds (e.g. spreadsheets)


Above Average
Sales, home move and registration operations integrated in one


Criteria
solution but this is not a cost-optimal solution due to poor quality


 
data, lack of training and poor exception handling


 
Sales teams have a up-to-date view of supply point details at point


 
of sale and therefore can validate meter details and read at point of


 
entry but commonly overlook discrepancies in order to complete


 
the sale


 
Formal validation in place, (such as automated address validation,


 
automated bank details validation, identity validation, etc.) is


 
carried out after point of sale and so data is corrected with the


 
customer still in contact


 
Automated credit check process performed after customer sign-up


 
Existing customers are usually not mistaken for ânew customersâ as


 
the sales agent has a view of the supply point and associated


 
customers at the point of sale


 
Product/service configuration agreed at point of sale, enabling


 
flexible price plans/payment arrangements


 
Automated communication between suppliers/industry to confirm


 
change of supplier but exception handling requires significant FTE


 
support


Leading Criteria:
Sales, home move and registration operations are integrated in one


 
solution and executed by multi-skilled agents and field


 
representatives who work collaboratively to process transactions


 
within the pre-defined service level agreement


 
Sales teams have an up-to-date view of supply point details at point


 
of sale and therefore can validate meter details in real time


 
Integrated credit check process at the point of sign-up


 
All data is validated on entry, such as addresses, bank details,


 
identity details and credit rating - there are overrides for exceptions


 
like cherished addresses, foreign addresses, customers with poor


 
credit. Validation is automated and has negligible impact on


 
processing times


 
Automated communication between suppliers/industry including


 
filtering and auto-validation of all messages


 
Fully automated and integrated transfer process that confirms a


 
unique meter identifier to the master market data right now to the


 
move in


 
Transfer exceptions are routed automatically to customer service


 
agents

Cross Sell / Up Sell


 




 




Description:
Cross Sell/Up Sell is the process to identify, act on and secure


 
opportunities to increase the value of the customer base and provide


 
additional valued products and services to retail utility customers.


Basic Criteria:
Application architecture does not support the identification of up


 
sell opportunities outside of the standard sales process


 
Data is not available to sales team so that they have a complete


 
view of the customer and their existing product holding


 
Identification and understanding that agents should be trained to


 
convert customer service call to a sales call if prompted by a


 
customer


 
Customers are not offered tangible incentives or bundling options


 
to expand their product holding


 
Customer quotes are often inaccurate due to poor data for tariffs


 
and estimated consumption


 
Enabling one bill for multiple products is a manual and time


 
consuming process


Threshold Criteria:
Application architecture supports the identification of


 
opportunities, primarily driven by the effectiveness of the latest


 
marketing campaign


 
Data is not readily available to sales team but agents do have a


 
view of the supply points available and simple product holdings


 
Identification and understanding that agents should be trained to


 
convert customer service call to a sales call without the need to


 
transfer


 
Customers are offered quotes based on past billing levels via


 
advertising such as bill inserts


 
Customer quotes are often artificially low so as to entice the


 
customer


 
Customer data model is not flexible enough to process a product


 
change in real time with the customer


Above Average
Application and process architecture supports the identification of


Criteria
opportunities through standard customer service and sales


 
processes (e.g. up sell as part of standard wrap up script)


 
Data is available to sales team so that they have a single view of


 
the customer and their product holding at initial point of contact


 
presented to the agent using computer telephony integration (CIT)


 
technology and caller identification


 
Training requires agents to provide customer with a quote (which is


 
auto-generated) during a customer service call, thereby gaining


 
customer commitment before the sales process is initiated


 
Customers are given quotes on a regular basis based on customer


 
segments, past usage and length of time with retailer


 
Customer data model is flexible such that the customer account can


 
remain static for a change to their product holding but this is poorly


 
controlled and tracked


Leading Criteria:
Application and process architecture supports the identification of


 
opportunities following auto-prompts generated according to


 
customer profile


 
Data is available to the sales agent so that they have a single view


 
of the customer and their predicted behavior


 
Agent is automatically informed about recent complaints, sales


 
opportunities and special needs at initial point of contact with


 
customer


 
Training requires agents to respond to auto-prompts and provide


 
customized bundles and quotes to individual customers using a


 
product configuration tool


 
Customers are given quotes on a regular basis according to


 
individual levels of estimated lifetime value and predicted behavior


 
via customized advertising vehicles


 
Customer data model is flexible such that the customer account can


 
remain static for a change to their product holding and can be


 
processed in real time

and churn.


Basic Criteria:
No formal process in place to specifically target high value


 
customers


 
Limited integration with loyalty program when executing retention


 
processes


 
Customer withdrawal process includes mandatory checks for


 
opportunity to object to and potentially save the customer from


 
leaving (these basic checks are in line with regulatory compliance)


 
Customers who have begun the withdrawal process are not targeted


 
by a âsave campaignâ


 
Forwarding details for former customers are not collected


 
Retention program is not measured for effectiveness or efficiencies


Threshold Criteria:
Processes in place to identify high value customers by segment are


 
in place


 
Loyalty program is executed through the retention processes and


 
incentives are in line with delivering a consistent customer


 
experience


 
Customer withdrawal process includes mandatory checks for


 
opportunity to object to and potentially save the customer from


 
leaving (these basic checks are in line with customer advocacy


 
processes and the loyalty program)


 
Forwarding details for former customers are automatically


 
collected so that the customer may be contacted in the future for


 
win-back campaigns


 
Retention program metrics are loosely based on the loyalty


 
program and are in a standard format


Above Average
High value customers are identified using profiles, preferences,


Criteria
segments, and values


 
Loyalty program and analytics are executed through standardized


 
processes to identify and adequately retain high value customer


 
Customer withdrawal process includes mandatory checks for an


 
opportunity to object but also includes a prompt to save the


 
customer


 
The resulting âsave campaignâ list is sorted such that high value


 
customers are prioritized


 
The process for customers that are retained or âsavedâ (i.e. they do


 
not complete the withdrawal or are immediately won back) is


 
costly and slow so that âcost per saveâ is high


 
Individual retention actions are measured for effectiveness and


 
efficiency which roll up into loyalty program metrics


 
Customers who are not saved receive targeted recovery letters or


 
emails inviting their feedback and indicating retailer's interest in


 
having them back as a customer in the future


Leading Criteria:
High value customers identified based on customer drivers and


 
lifetime value to specifically tailor retention offers


 
Retention efforts are directly implemented based on the loyalty


 
program plans


 
The resulting âsave campaignâ list is sorted such that high value


 
customers are prioritized and the outbound contact is automated via


 
predictive dialing or customers preferred contact method


 
Customers are âsavedâ (i.e. they do not complete the withdrawal or


 
they are immediately won back) - this process is low cost and quick


 
to react to customer intentions and even predicted intentions


 
Forwarding details of customers who could not be retained is


 
collected with the customers' approval so that the customer may be


 
contacted at a time when they should receive their first bill from


 
their new supplier when their new deal can be reviewed against a


 
competitive offer

Usage


 




 




Description:
Usage is the ability to collect, validate and store consumption data such


 
that a customer may be billed accurately and in a timely manner. This


 
capability includes gathering all types of meter reads and managing the


 
read schedule.


Basic Criteria:
Reads are costly to collect due to frequent problems accessing


 
some meters


 
Reads are rarely uploaded in a consistent format so that upload


 
processing has a significant level of exception processing.


 
Reads are collected but not validated at the supply point so reads


 
that are entered incorrectly are not amended onsite and the quality


 
of read data uploaded causes high volume of exception processing


 
Reads are often forced complete or estimated if a read is


 
unavailable


 
Meter read scheduling is coordinated (commodity read schedules


 
are integrated where possible) and the majority of meters are read


 
within the required service level agreement


 
Read history is not stored in a single, central location, making


 
replacement billing and disputed reads processing costly and


 
awkward


 
Meter reads are not captured in standardized format, making


 
compilation for analysis and trending difficult (e. g. manually, via


 
spreadsheets, electronic data transfer, and therefore requires


 
significant FTE support)


 
Manual manipulation required for ad hoc or off-cycle readings


 
Inability to assess manual meter read quality and performance at


 
the individual level


Threshold Criteria:
Read collection is fairly efficient and is uploaded using various


 
formats/applications


 
Reads are collected and validated at the supply point using mobile


 
technology improving the quality of the data uploaded


 
Reads are sometimes forced complete or estimated if a read is


 
unavailable


 
Meter read scheduling is complex with reads being distributed


 
across billing cycles for cash flow and threshold processing. All


 
meters are read within the required service level agreements


 
Read history is stored in a single, central location and are


 
controlled by process and business rules


 
Meter operators and meter operator agents are given online access


 
to customer data such that explicit access instructions can be


 
passed from customer to agent and so that the agent follows any


 
required security routine


 
Ability to assess manual meter read quality and performance at the


 
route level only


Above Average
Reads are collected via multiple channels and uploaded in a more


Criteria
standardized format but the tools for analysis and trending are not


 
readily available


 
Regardless of channel or application, all reads are validated at


 
point of entry such that the data uploaded is high quality


 
Reads are rarely forced complete or estimated if a read is


 
unavailable


 
Meter read scheduling is more complex and flexible; can include


 
the ability to automatically balance reading routes and cycle days


 
with travel modes (walking, driving), types of meters (automated


 
and manual read), read required, etc. - ad hoc changes in


 
routes/cycles easily incorporated


 
Read history is stored in a single, central location where it is


 
accessible and simple to maintain


 
Target service levels for timeliness, accuracy and completeness are


 
consistently achieved


 
Ability to assess manual meter read quality and performance

Meter Data Management


 




 




Description:
Meter Data Management includes the organization 


 
of meter data according to supply point 


 
configuration, data security, data quality 


 
management and integrity.


Basic Criteria:
Meter data is imported using ad hoc methods 


 
and templates leading to inconsistent data - a 


 
high volume of exceptions and billing backlogs. 


 
Backlogs tend to become regulatory compliance 


 
issues or have major impacts on business 


 
performance


 
No proactive management of meter data quality


 
Meter data is stored and modeled in several 


 
applications and therefore does not support a 


 
robust data model


 
Historical meter data is stored according to 


 
regulatory requirements but it inaccessible 


 
and is not auditable


 
Meter data database has no concept of, or 


 
alignment with, business processes, it is simply 


 
a data repository. Relevant meter data is also 


 
stored in other systems/formats (e.g. customer 


 
records or spreadsheets)


Threshold Criteria:
Meter data is imported and transferred using 


 
inconsistent file formats which require complex 


 
validation. Meter data management typically 


 
requires a significant FTE impact and lack of data 


 
integrity affects the customer experience


 
No dedicated meter data management solution - 


 
data is managed according to standard report 


 
formats across all back office operations. 


 
Resolution of issues and improvement in 


 
performance requires skilled IT resources


 
Meter data is stored and modeled in a few 


 
major applications and therefore supports a 


 
consistent data model


 
Meter data is stored in multiple systems (without 


 
a clearly defined master) in order to be aligned 


 
with other business functions but this means that 


 
the data can become inconsistent across systems


Above Average
Meter data is imported and transferred using 


Criteria
standard file formats which are subject to 


 
automated validation to ensure consistent data 


 
integrity. This upload of data generates a high 


 
volume of exceptions and therefore can affect 


 
the efficiency of back office operations and 


 
impact the customer experience


 
Meter data management system offers analysis 


 
tools for data quality but cannot quickly and 


 
consistently identify the root cause of data 


 
integrity issues. Resolution of issues and 


 
improvement in performance is supported by 


 
system tools and therefore does not always 


 
require skilled IT resources


 
Meter data is mastered in one application. 


 
Data dictionaries are created but poorly 


 
maintained and often out of date - this can lead 


 
to inconsistent data entity definitions in other 


 
systems


 
Meter data management solution is configured 


 
to support business processes such as new 


 
connections, meter exchanges, settlement and 


 
scheduled billing


Leading Criteria:
Meter data is imported and transferred using 


 
standard file formats which are subject to 


 
automated validation and auto-correction to 


 
ensure consistent data integrity. Exceptions 


 
are handled within


 
SLA to ensure no backlog for the upload of 


 
reads and generation of bills


 
Meter data is transferred in real time via smart 


 
metering home devices


 
Meter data management system offers graphical 


 
analysis tools for comparing raw/industry data 


 
to system edited data and will track defined KPI 


 
values


 
Meter data is mastered in one application and 


 
data integrity in other systems is ensured by the 


 
clear definition of an integrated data model (data 


 
dictionary, data event modeling, metadata defined)


 
All historical meter data is stored and is auditable 


 
to specific user edits enabling efficient resolution 


 
of data integrity issues


 
Meter data management solution is integrated 


 
with billing and CRM solutions to support 


 
business processes such as new connections, meter 


 
exchanges, settlement and scheduled billing

 FIG. 13 shows a multidimensional utility industry performance reference set 1300 (âreference set 1300â) that provides a capability detail pool from which the system described below may obtain benchmarking tables for a utility business. The reference set 1300 includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables (âreference tablesâ), two of which are labeled 1302 and 1304. Each reference table may provide the benchmarking criteria for a specific capability, such as those noted above with respect to FIGS. 2-13.
One dimension of each table may establish the âBasicâ performance level 140 specifying âBasicâ performance assessment criteria, the âThresholdâ performance level 142 specifying âThresholdâ performance assessment criteria, the âAbove Averageâ performance level 144 specifying âAbove Averageâ performance assessment criteria, and the âLeadingâ performance level 145 specifying âLeadingâ performance assessment criteria. Another dimension of each table may specify one or more key assessment areas (KAAs), several of which are labeled 1306, 1308, and 1310. As noted above, performance criteria, e.g., the PCC 1312, populates each key assessment performance reference table to provide benchmark criteria for âBasicâ, âThresholdâ, âAbove Average,â and âLeadingâ characteristics.
The reference set 1300 represents the HPCA model 100. Consistent with the HPCA model 100, the reference set 1300 may organize multiple reference tables into a hierarchical structure defining discrete changes in granularity. In one implementation, the hierarchical structure includes reference tables, sub-platforms, platforms, and models. FIG. 13 labels three sub-platforms 1314, 1316, and 1318. The reference set 1300 may further organize the platforms into sub-platforms, two of which are labeled 1320 and 1322. Platforms aggregate into the HPCA model 100 and corresponding reference set 1300. Additional, different, or fewer levels of granularity may be defined in the HPCA model 100.
The reference set 1300 may dynamically populate the reference tables with the most up-to-date performance criteria, for example upon retrieval and presentation by a business analysis consultant. The performance criteria may be retrieved from a performance capability criteria database or other information source.
 FIG. 13 also shows an example of a database implementation 1324 of a portion of a reference table. In particular, the database implementation 1324 includes records (e.g., the records 1326, 1328, 1330, 1331) that establish each PCC 1312. In the example shown, each record includes a PCC field 1332, a category specifier field 1334, and a KAA specifier field 1336. Other fields may be provided, such as a reference table assignment field or reference set assignment field. The records categorize each PCC into a specific category (e.g., Basic), into a specific KAA, and, optionally, into a specific reference table in a specific reference set for any particular HPCA model.
 FIG. 14 shows a high-performance capability assessment system (âsystemâ) 1400. The system 1400 includes a processor 1402 and a memory 1404. Several databases support the operation of the system 1400, including a capability performance database 1406, a performance measured database 1408, a capability detail pool database 1410, and an assessment results database 1426. The system 1400 may include a local display 1412 and input/output interfaces 1417 (e.g., including a keyboard, mouse, microphone, speakers, or other device), and, through the communication interface 1414 and networks 1416, may communicate with remote devices 1418 and remote displays 1420. The networks 1416 may be any combination of external networks (e.g., the Internet) and internal networks (e.g., corporate LANs). The displays 1412 and 1420 may, for example, present performance capability assessment models 1422 that the system 1400 retrieves from the capability detail pool database 1410 for review, modification, and application by process engineers or other individuals. With regard to local access or access by the remote devices 1418, the system 1400 may include a login processing program 1424 to authenticate and/or authorize access to the system 1400. To that end, the login processing program 1424 may include username/password verification, private/public key encryption, or other validation and data protection capabilities.
In one implementation, the capability performance database 1406 stores performance criteria. As will be described in more detail below, the system 1400 may populate performance capability assessment models with performance capability criteria suited to any particular platform (e.g., manage retail strategy platform 102, manage interaction platform 104, etc.) and business capability at one or more capability levels across one or more key assessment areas. The performance measured database 1408 may store the determined, measured, or otherwise ascertained characteristics, criteria, and other measured data of a particular key assessment area as representative practice data 1448. The representative practice data 1448 may be obtained through interviews with business consultants and industrial engineers, through online questionnaires, through manual or automated analysis of business data (e.g., year-end operating reports), or in other manners. The capability detail pool database 1410 stores the capability detail pool 1300, which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models 1422. The assessment results database 1426 stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.
The system 1400 facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (âmanipulation logicâ) 1446 within the system 1400 creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data 1428 in the memory 1404. The manipulation logic 1446 may establish capability assessment data 1428 in the memory 1404, including a capability assessment data structure 1430 with multiple capability levels (âCLâ) 1432 organized along a scale of mastery dimension, multiple key assessment areas (âKAAâ) 1434 organized along a key factor dimension, and performance criteria (âPCCâ) 1436 that populates the performance capability assessment model 1430. The manipulation logic 1446 may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic 1452 that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, modify existing performance capability assessment models, delete performance capability assessment models, or retrieve performance capability assessment models for review.
In one implementation, the manipulation logic 1446 establishes the capability assessment data structure 1430 to include a multidimensional utility industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a âBasicâ capability performance level, a âThresholdâ capability performance level, an âAbove Averageâ capability performance level, and a âLeadingâ capability performance level.
The capability assessment data 1428 may also include a capability position specifier 1438. The capability position specifier 1438 may record the capability level along the scale of mastery 146, as determined for any particular capability. Thus, the system 1400 may store the performance level in the assessment results database 1426 or elsewhere for future retrieval and review.
In one implementation, the data population logic 1440 may be a data population program executed by the processor 1402 that populates template performance capability assessment models. For example, the data population logic 1440 may include input logic 1450 that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 1440 may include query logic 1445 that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.
In another implementation, for example, the query logic 1445 may receive an input specifying a utility industry area and a utility industry key assessment area with the utility industry area for analysis. The query logic 1445 searches the multidimensional utility industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the utility industry area and the utility industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.
The data population logic 1440 may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model. The data population logic 1440 produces populated performance capability assessment structures 1442 that may be stored in the capability detail pool database 1410.
In addition to the analysis process described above, the system 1400 may provide an automated analysis of representative practice data 1448 that identifies relevant performance capability criteria and determines the position on the scale of mastery 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria for the representative practice data 1448. As one example, the system 1400 may implement capability assessment logic 1444 that includes comparison and/or matching logic that analyzes the representative practice data 1448 with respect to performance capability criteria to locate key assessment areas for which the system 1400 can determine capability levels to obtain a resultant performance level for each key assessment area.
Furthermore, the capability assessment logic 1444 may determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 as the capability position specifier 1438, for a capability under examination given the knowledge of where the key assessment areas corresponding to the capability under examination fall in each capability level. Thus, for example, the capability assessment logic 1444 may determine an overall capability level for a capability corresponding to the capability level for the majority of the key assessment areas, or it may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for a capability. As another example, the capability assessment logic 1444 may implement an expert system (e.g., based on a neural network trained on prior determinations) that analyzes the determined characteristics with respect to the performance capability criteria and ascertains where the capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery 146 for each of the key assessment areas, or overall on the scale of mastery.
 FIG. 15 shows a flow diagram 1500 for creating performance capability assessment models. The performance capability assessment model creator (e.g., the manipulation logic 1446) establishes a key factor dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1502). The performance capability assessment model creator also establishes a capability scale dimension for the performance capability assessment model (1504). The capability scale dimension may define a scale of increasing organizational capability. For example, the structure creator may create the âBasicâ level 140, the âThresholdâ level 142, the âAbove Averageâ level 144, and the âLeadingâ level 145. The performance capability assessment model creator also populates the performance capability assessment model with capability performance criteria (1506). A capability detail pool 1300 may be formed to hold multiple tailored key assessment performance reference tables (1508). The performance capability assessment model creator may store the populated assessment structure in the capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and analysis (1510).
 FIG. 16 shows a flow diagram 1600 for retrieving and applying performance capability assessment models. A selection of a capability to be analyzed is obtained (1602). In one implementation, the system 1400 receives input data that specifies a utility industry area and a utility industry key assessment area for analysis. For example, the system 1400 may accept input from a business consultant that specifies a capability for analysis. The system 1400 may query the capability detail pool 1300 for a corresponding performance capability assessment model (1604). The corresponding performance capability assessment model may be pre-defined in the capability detail pool 1300, or the data population logic 1330 (or other actor) may populate a performance capability assessment model template that the system 1400 newly creates, or that the system 1400 retrieves from a data store, such as the capability detail pool database 1410.
In another example, the system 1400 searches the multidimensional utility industry performance reference set in the capability detail pool 1300 for a matching key assessment performance reference table based on the input data that specifies a utility industry platform and a utility industry key assessment area. The system 1400 retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table and initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance level for the utility industry key assessment area.
The system 1400 obtains representative practice data 1448 for the capability under examination in the specific business under review (1606). For example, a business consultant may interview the business to determine how the business currently executes the capability under review. As another example, a representative from the business may complete a questionnaire, submit business data for analysis and parameter extraction, or otherwise provide the characteristics of their current capability execution. As a further example, the system 1400 may retrieve the representative practice data 1448 from a database of previously obtained representative practice data.
The system 1400 compares the representative practice data 1448 to the performance criteria in the performance capability assessment model (1608). For example, a business consultant may use his or her expertise to arrive at a determination of level for the business and the capability under examination (1610). Alternatively or additionally, the capability assessment logic 1444 may perform an automated analysis of the assessment results data in the assessment results database 1426 and ascertain the performance level on the scale of mastery 146 (1610). The system 1400 may store the assessment results, including the determined performance level, for future reference in the assessment results database 1426 or other location (1612).
 FIG. 17 shows a flow diagram 1700 for analyzing representative practice data 1448 to determine a utility industry and a utility key assessment area to which the representative practice data applies. The system 1400 receives representative practice data 1448 as input data (1702). The system 1400 may receive the representative practice data 1448 from a database query performed by the query logic 1445 that the query logic executes periodically, when instructed by an operator, and/or automatically against any number of available database sources that store representative practice data 1448. The capability assessment logic 1444 analyzes the representative practice data 1448 to identify performance capability criteria in the capability detail pool 1300 that the capability assessment logic 1444 determines relevant to the representative practice data 1448 (1704). For example, the capability assessment logic 1444 may compare and/or match the content of the representative practice data 1448 with the performance capability criteria using natural language processing (NLP), text string and/or substring matching, by comparing tags linked to the representative practice data 1448 and that specify that any portion of the representative practice data 1448 is applicable to a specific PCC, by querying for a manual classification of the representative practice data 1448 to a PCC, or other matching technique. The capability assessment logic 1444 may score and/or weight a performance capability criteria and compare the score and/or weight to a user specified relevance threshold to rank the relevance of the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1448 (1706). The user may specify particular terms and/or phrases to search and match between the performance capability criteria and the representative practice data 1448, in order to score the performance capability criteria.
The capability assessment logic 1444 may determine, based on the number of performance capability criteria that meet or exceed the relevance threshold, that the capability assessment logic 1444 has identified a sufficient number of performance capability criteria for a specific key assessment area in order to determine a performance level for the capability as a whole or any key assessment area within the capability (1708). As one example, where at least 51% of the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area meet or exceed the relevance threshold, the capability assessment logic 1444 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1448. In another example, the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area may be ranked in importance and/or designated as mandatory in order to assess the key assessment area. In the event the capability assessment logic 1444 identifies the mandatory performance capability criteria for a key assessment area, the capability assessment logic 1444 applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data 1448.
The capability assessment logic 1444 may apply the performance capability criteria meeting or exceeding the relevance threshold to the representative practice data 1448 to determine whether any particular PCC is met. Accordingly, as the capability assessment logic 1444 analyzes the PCC, the system 1400 tracks the best fit of the representative practice data 1448 to the PCCs in the key assessment performance reference tables. In other words, the system 1400 determines how the representative practice data 1448 meets (or does not meet) each PCC, thereby gaining insight into whether the representative practice data 1448 is indicative of Basic, Threshold, Above Average, or Leading practices.
The system 1400 may also gauge the position on the scale of mastery 146 of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria (1710). The capability assessment logic 1444 may further determine an overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for a capability (1712). The capability assessment logic 1444 may establish that a desired number and/or designated mandatory performance capability criteria for the key assessment areas have been identified as relevant to a capability and sufficient to determine the position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability. For example, the capability assessment logic 1444 may determine an overall performance level for the capability based on the performance level determined for the majority of the key assessment areas. The capability assessment logic 1444 may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery 146 for the capability. Although selected aspects, features, or components of the implementations are depicted as being stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as computer-executable instructions or performance capability assessment models), all or part of the systems and structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include, for example, secondary storage devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs; a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received at an antenna; or other forms of memory, including ROM or RAM, either currently known or later developed.
Various implementations of the system 1400 may include additional or different components. A processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The processing capability of the system may be distributed among multiple system components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may be implemented in many ways, including data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms. Programs may be combined or split among multiple programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.
The HPCA 100 model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the utility industry. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the HPCA model, including the criteria noted in Tables 5-71 above, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes the specific processes to improve, and how to improve the process and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.
