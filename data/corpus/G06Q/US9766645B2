FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
This disclosure relates generally to home systems, and more particularly to an energy management system and method.
BACKGROUND
Current energy management systems take a passive role to residential energy management. For example, consumers lack energy awareness and are typically left with having to evaluate a monthly bill to determine how much energy was consumed. Additionally, consumers lack transparency into what the leading causes of energy consumption are at their residences. Some utility companies are providing energy display only technologies that will allow consumers to see what the current price of energy may be. However, such displays take a passive role to conservation, and leaving it up to the consumer to manually curtail their use.
In certain regions, information infrastructure is lacking to enable utility companies and customers to access real-time energy consumption. For example, some regions have smart meters that are capable measuring and reporting consumption data. However, there is a lack of communication and analytical infrastructure to allow utility companies to analyze future demand and schedule energy production. For example, some utilities are providing demand response systems that react to load levels, and force curtailment on residential, industrial, and commercial customers. Such programs have not been well received as they typically inconvenience the end user.

Energy management system 200 can also include server 204 disposed remotely from site 202 and capable of generating a control action report to control the network device. Controller 216 can also be located at site 202 including a residential site. Controller 202 can be in communication with server 204. According to an aspect, controller 202 can establish initiate a plurality of operating status requests of the network device, and receive device data in response to at least one of the operating status requests. Controller 202 can further generate a site report including the device data, and initiate a communication of the site report to server 204. During the communication of the site report from controller 202 to server 204, controller 202 can detect an availability of a control action report at server 202 in conjunction with the communication of the site report. As such, a secure connection can be initiated from site 202 to communicate site reports and receive control action reports without having to have server 204 initiate a communication with site 202.
According to another aspect, server 202 can generate control action report prior to a site report upload, in association with a site report upload, or any combinations thereof. For example, one or more control action reports can be generated and queued in advance of a site report upload. In other forms, a control action report can be generated during a site report upload. In yet another form, a control action report can be generated in response to information uploaded within the site report. As such, various combinations of control action report generation techniques can be deployed as needed or desired.
According to an aspect, energy management system 200 can be used to generate a control action report in response to a distance mobile client 210 may be from site 202. For example, site 202 can include a network device, such as TSTAT 208, joined to wireless energy network 242. According to an aspect, controller 216 can be configured to establish wireless energy network 242 using a wireless mesh network and initiate a plurality of operating status requests. For example, controller 216 can access TSTAT 208 using wireless energy network 242 at a first operating status request interval. Controller 216 can be used to generate a site report that can include device data of TSTAT 208 at a site report interval. According to an aspect, a site report interval can be the same interval as the first operating status request interval. In other forms, each interval can be different. For example, the first operating status report request interval can be set to thirty seconds and the site report interval can be set to sixty seconds. As such, two cycles of data can be acquired. Various combinations of intervals can be used as desired.
According to a further aspect, controller 216 can initiate a communication of site report to a remote server such as server 204 using gateway 218. For example, gateway 218 can include a residential broadband connection 206 capable of establishing a secure gateway connection between site 202 and server 204 using a public communication network. According to an aspect, residential broadband connection 206 does not include a cellular communications based network.
In another form, control data can be provided in response to a detection of a travel direction and a distance between mobile device 210 having location reporting device, and site 202. For example, as a user of mobile device 210 is moving away from site 202, server 204 can detect a direction and distance mobile device 210 may be from residential site 202. Server 204 can then determine if a control action should be generated. For example, as mobile device 210 moves away from residential site 202, TSTAT 208 setting can be adjusted up during a warm or summer season (or down during a cold or winter season) to reduce energy consumption. Other network devices can also be adjusted as needed or desired.
According to a further aspect, energy management system 200 can use energy pricing monitor 228 to generate a control action report. For example, energy pricing monitor 228 can be configured to detect energy pricing within an energy market, and initiate curtailing use of a network device, such as TSTAT 208, smart appliance 212, other network devices at site 202, or any combination thereof. For example, energy pricing monitor 228 can output a control action report in response to an unfavorable pricing condition, and further upon the detection of a travel direction and a distance between mobile device 210 and site 202. In another form, energy pricing monitor 228 can also initiate use of one or more network devices at site 202 in response to a favorable pricing condition, and a detection of a travel direction and a distance between mobile device 210 and residential site 202. In this manner, a user's travel direction, distance, and current energy pricing within a market can be used to determine how energy consumption can occur at site 202.
According to a further aspect, energy management system 200 can also use demand response module 230 to detect a demand response condition and respond accordingly. For example, demand response module 230 can be used to detect a grid condition favorable to a demand response event and detect a profile preference setting of an user or site manager of site 202. For example, a user or site manager can set a profile to always participate, not participate, or have a request sent to collaborate on whether to participate. Other profile settings can also be used such as determining an economic or monetary value to a user or site manager if participating in a demand response event. For example, a favorable grid condition can include an increase in the price of energy due to an undersupply of energy within an energy transmission system or market (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 2). In another form, a favorable condition can include an oversupply of energy purchased by an energy provider of site 202. Additionally, a high demand period can be detected and the oversupply of energy can be increased using a demand response event. In another form, a favorable grid condition can include a time interval when transmission pricing to use an energy transmission system may be determined. As such, an energy provider would receive an economic benefit from reducing load when the transmission rate or rate for using transmission lines would be determined. Various combinations of favorable grid conditions can be detected as needed or desired in association with determining a demand response event to curtail energy use at site 202.
According to an aspect, energy management system 200 can use demand response module 230 configured to detect an energy capacity of site 202 having a residence. For example, demand response module 230 can detect a grid condition favorable to a demand response event, and can also detect a preference of an resident or owner of the residence to participate in demand response events. Demand response module 230 can also determine an energy capacity of site 202 using historical device consumption data received in a site report, and forecasted device consumption data. Control data can then be generated to alter an operating condition of the network device in response to the grid condition and the preference of the owner and the energy capacity of site 202.
According to a further aspect, server 204 can determine an energy capacity of site 202 using device data received in association with site reports received from site 202. For example, site report data can be used with efficiency rating module 232 to determine a virtual generation capacity or energy reduction capacity of site 202. Upon detecting an available capacity, demand response module 230 can output a curtailment action to be used within a control action report to be communicated to site 202. For example, a curtailment action can include an updated control data to alter a current operating condition of one or more network devices connected to wireless energy network 242 at site 202.
According to a further aspect, controller 216 can be configured to detect a new set-point value within a control action report, and identify TSTAT 208 to be adjusted to the new set-point value. In some forms, multiple wireless thermostats can be accessed via wireless energy network 242 and adjusted as desired. Controller 216 can communicate a different set-point values to each of the wireless thermostats. Controller 216 can initiate an outputting of new set-point values to TSTAT 208 and others using wireless energy network 242.
According to an aspect, energy management system 200 can use proximity detection module 234 to detect a distance mobile device 210 may be from site 202 including a residential site. For example, proximity detection module 234 can access location data stored within database 224 and provided by mobile device 210 using mobile client interface 226. Proximity detection module 234 can further detect mobile device 210 within a first zone (e.g. less than one (1) mile from the site, less than three (3) miles from site, greater than five (5) miles from site, etc.). Proximity detection module can further detect a current thermostat setting of TSTAT 208, and an indoor temperature detected at site 202 and communicated within a site data report communicated from site 202. Proximity detection module 234 can then determine a percentage adjustment to adjust a current setting of TSTAT 208, and output the percentage adjustment as a new set-point value to be used within a control action report. For example, if mobile device 210 can be detect as being greater than three (3) miles from site 202, TSTAT 208 can be adjusted to within 75% of the maximum setting in a summer season, or minimum setting in a winter season. As such, a site 202 can be managed based on a user's proximity to a site, which zone a user may be located in, and current seasonal schedule or setting being used at a site 202.
According to another aspect, energy management system 200 can include TSTAT 208 configured as a wireless thermostat capable of joining wireless energy network 242 operable as a wireless home energy network. According to an aspect, TSTAT 208 can be configured to not include an enabled local programming schedule configured to control an HVAC system of site 202. For example, TSTAT 208 can include sufficient memory to store a set-point value, but may be not include scheduling capabilities at TSTAT 208. As such, a simplified user interface of TSTAT 208 can be deployed. For example, if TSTAT 208 includes a scheduling feature, energy management system 200 can be used to disable the scheduling feature located at TSTAT 208. As such, TSTAT 208 can be considered a non-programmable thermostat capable of connecting to wireless energy network 242, and set-point values or other control actions can be received using wireless energy network 242. In this manner, scheduling use of TSTAT 208 can be provided using on-line or web application based scheduling tool.
According to a further aspect, controller 216 can be further configured to initiate joining TSTAT 208 to wireless energy network 242 using a unique identifier of TSTAT 208. A unique identifier of TSTAT 208 can be received from server 204 and a local schedule and or scheduling capabilities of TSTAT 208 can be disabled. In this manner, an overall design complexity of a thermostat can be reduced and scheduling capabilities can be provided using a schedule created within a network environment and output by controller 216, server 204, mobile device 210, or any combination of sources capable of providing schedule information or control action data to TSTAT 208.
According to another aspect, energy management system 200 can also use scheduling module 236 to schedule use of a network device located at site 202 and capable of connecting to wireless energy network 242. Additionally, multiple user schedules can be stored within database 224 and used by site 202. For example, scheduling module 236 can be used to detect a first user schedule accessible to controller 216. The first user schedule can include a first schedule event configured to alter an operating condition of a network device such as TSTAT 208, smart appliance 212, or other energy consuming network devices. According to an aspect, the first user schedule can be operably linked to mobile device 210 having a location detection device. The first user schedule can be used or not used based on a distance mobile device 210 may be from residence 202. In this manner, as user returns to residential site 202, a user schedule can be activated and used.
According to another aspect, energy management system 200 can include a second user schedule accessible to controller 216. For example, a second user schedule can include scheduling data to schedule a second schedule event configured to alter an operating condition of a network device at site 202. The second user schedule can be operably linked to a second mobile device having a location reporting device (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 2). For example, the second user schedule can be used or not used based on a distance a second mobile device may be from site 202. In another form, mobile device 210 may not be located at site 202, but a second mobile device may located be at site 202. In this form, a second user schedule may be based on detecting the second mobile device located at site 202. According to an aspect, the second user schedule can be disabled when the second user leaves the site 202 and a proximity mode can be enabled. According to a further aspect, a second user schedule may not be operably linked to any mobile device. As such, controller 216 can use a second user's schedule to schedule events in response to a detection of mobile device 210 being a distance away from residential site 202. In this manner, multiple user schedules and proximity control of energy use can be deployed at a common site.
According to an aspect, energy management system 200 can also include controller 242 capable of detecting advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) wireless network 248 output by smart metering device 250. For example, smart metering device 250 can include, or can be coupled to, AMI/Gateway 242 capable of outputting AMI wireless network 248. In other forms, smart metering device 250 can be configured to output AMI wireless network 248 directly.
According to another aspect, controller 216 can be configured with a communication interface (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 2) to enable joining AMI wireless network 248.

In a further aspect, controller 216 can use the AMI data to alter an operating condition of a network device at site 202, output AMI data using a display of a network device, communicate AMI data to server 204, or any combination thereof. According to a further aspect, controller 216 can communicate the AMI data with site report data as a site report to server 204. As such, AMI data and site report data can be used at server 204.
According to a further aspect, controller 216 can connect to AMI wireless network 248 at a first security level, and alter an operating condition of a network device connected to wireless energy network 242 at a second security level. According to an aspect, wireless energy network 242 can be deployed at the same security level as AMI wireless network 248, can be deployed at a different security level than AMI wireless network 248, or any combination thereof.
According to a further aspect, a user or site profile can be used to enable use of control actions initiated or received by AMI wireless network 248. For example, a site manager or user can establish a profile setting to enable or disable a utility company to alter an operating condition of a network device at a residence. As such, controller 216 can access a profile setting prior to connecting to AMI wireless network 248, enabling use of a control action received using the AMI wireless network 248, or any combination thereof. In other forms, controller 216 can access server 204 to detect profile settings.
According to another aspect, energy management system 200 can also include controller 216 configured to communicate using a Zigbee network and a WIFI network.

For example, a user can use an IPAD to access controller 216. Using WIFI network 244 and wireless energy network 242, a user can receive operating status information, initiate control actions of network devices, schedule energy use, or various other energy management activities. In some forms, controller 216 may not have access to network 206. Controller 216 can include portions or all of the capabilities of server 204 to schedule energy use, generate scheduling data, access site data, generate control action data, or any combination thereof. As such, in some instances network 206 may not be established (e.g. in a new construction site, etc.), or if a network failure or an absence of network availability occurs, a user can access network devices at site 202 and manage energy use.
According to another aspect, controller 216 can detect when mobile device 210 connects to WIFI network 244 and alter an operating condition of a network device coupled to wireless energy network 242. For example, as mobile device 210 moves or transitions away from site 202, controller 216 can detect a signal loss and alter an operating condition at site 202. According to an aspect, controller 216 can include control action data to be used upon detecting a signal loss. In other forms, controller 216 can report the signal loss to server 204 within, or external to a site report. Server 204 can then determine a control action (if any) in response to a reporting of the WIFI signal being lost.
According to a further aspect, server 204 can initiate a text message using messaging module 240 to be sent to mobile device 210. User of mobile device 210 can then view the text message and respond to alter an operating condition at site 202. For example, a user can place site 202 in proximity mode which will enable an energy efficiency schedule associated with the user. In other forms, a user can access an energy management application accessible to mobile device 210 and alter an operating condition at site 202. Various combinations of messaging communications (e.g. SMS text, email, social network messaging, social network postings, etc.), message content, and various combinations thereof can be used to inform a user of mobile device 210 that an operating condition can be altered in response to mobile device 210 not being connected to a WIFI signal at site 202, a detection of mobile device 210 being a distance from site 202 using location detection, or any combination thereof.

 FIG. 3 illustrates a method of managing energy at a site according to an aspect of the disclosure. Portions or all of the method of FIG. 3 can be used with portions or all of the energy management systems, devices, or apparatuses disclosed herein, or any other type of system, controller, device, module, processor, or any combination thereof, operable to employ all, or portions of, the method of FIG. 3. Additionally, the method can be embodied in various types of encoded logic including software, firmware, hardware, or other forms of digital storage mediums, computer readable mediums, or logic, or any combination thereof, operable to provide all, or portions, of the method of FIG. 3.
The method begins generally at block 300. At decision block 302, the method detects whether an energy network has been established. For example, a wireless energy network can be established and can include one or more networks that can be used to manage energy use at a site. According to an aspect, a wireless energy network can be established using a wireless enabled controller located at a residence. At decision block 302, a detection of an energy network, AMI enabled network, WIFI enabled network, Zigbee enabled network, WiMAX network, or any other type of energy network, or any combination thereof can be detected. If at decision block 302, one or more networks may not be detected, the method can proceed to decision block 304. At decision block 304, the method can detect if there is an AMI network available. If at decision block 304 there is an AMI network available, the network can proceed to block 306 and the AMI network can be joined. For example, the AMI network can include a specific protocol and security level to establish communication or allow a joining of the network. For example, the AMI network may require an encryption key-based security that can require specific keys, certificates, etc. to enable access. According to another aspect, the AMI network may include a smart grid based security described in Smart Grid standards. As such, various combinations of joining the AMI network can be deployed. Upon joining the AMI network, the method can proceed to decision block 308.
In some forms, an AMI network may be available and the method can be modified to determine whether to join the AMI network. If at decision block 304, an AMI network may not be detected (or may not be joined), the method can proceed to decision block 308. At decision block 308, the method can detect if a WIFI network (e.g. 802.11 based network) may be available. If a WIFI network is not detected or is not available, the method can proceed to block 310 and a WIFI network can be established. For example, a controller, network device, smart appliance, or various other types of energy consuming devices can include a WIFI communication device capable of initiating a WIFI network. As such, at block 310 a WIFI network can be established and the method can proceed to block 312. If at decision block 308 a WIFI network exists, or if a WIFI network should not be established, the method can proceed to block 312. In some forms, an additional WIFI network can be established at block 310 and the method can be modified to allow a bridging between the two WIFI networks.
According to an aspect, at block 312 an energy network can be established to manage one or more network devices. For example, an energy network can include a wireless energy network that is based on a Smart Grid standards and protocols such as a Zigbee based protocol. Various other types of communication can also be used to establish an energy network. An energy network can be established by outputting a wireless network at a site to enable a network device to join the energy network.
Upon establishing an energy network, the method can proceed to block 314 a network device capable of connecting to the energy network can be detected. For example, a network device can include a Zigbee enabled communication device capable of joining a Zigbee enabled energy network. A unique identifier of the network device can be detected and a profile can be obtained at block 316. In some forms, a unique identifier can be previously obtained by a controller deploying the energy network. For example, a unique identifier can be obtained from a server accessible to a controller, via a WIFI or other network accessible to a controller, or any combination thereof. In other forms, an external information source can be capable of providing a unique identifier, or a list of unique identifiers to identify a valid network device that can be joined to the energy network. A controller can then use the unique identifier, and the profile, to establish or join the network device to the energy network.
In another form, a profile of a network device may not be immediately available, or may have been revised. As such, a profile can be obtained using a WIFI network, an AMI network, an Internet or broadband network, or any combination thereof. For example, a unique identifier, a model number, a serial number, a device class identifier, or any combination thereof that can be communicated to an external source or information network to obtain a profile can be used. A profile can then be identified and used to join the network device to the energy network.
According to a further aspect, obtaining a profile at block 316 can include initiating a request using a controller and an information network accessible to a mobile device capable of communicating with a WIFI network at a site. For example, a profile can be provided by connecting a mobile device to a wireless information network such as a 3G data network, 4G data network, or other subscriber based wireless information network. The mobile device and then communicate the profile to the controller using the WIFI network at the site. The controller can then receive the profile and use at least a portion of the profile within the energy network.
According to an aspect, upon obtaining a profile, the method can proceed to block 318 and the network device can be joined to the energy network. For example, the network device can be joined at a security level that is different than required by an AMI network, or other secure network. In some forms, the network device can be joined to multiple networks or combination of networks while joined to the energy network. In other forms, the network device can be joined to only the energy network. In still other forms, an AMI network connection can be established to enable an AMI network to access the network device, and the network device can unjoin or disconnect the AMI network and join the energy network. In another form, information received from the AMI network can be used to alter an operating condition of the network device using the energy network. Various other permutations of joining a network device to an energy network or other networks can also be realized as needed or desired.
According to a further aspect, a network device can join the energy network using a standardized profile, such as a Zigbee profile. In addition, a network device can be joined using a profile modifier that can extend the functionality of the Zigbee profile associated with a specific network device. For example, a controller establishing the energy network can access profile modifiers to enhance use of a specific network device.
According to a further aspect, an AMI network can be joined during a period of time, and then the energy network can be joined during a separate time period. As such, various combinations of joining a network device to one or more networks can be used as needed or desired to manage energy use of a network device. Additionally, the method can be modified to join additional network devices to one or more networks as needed or desired. Upon joining one or more network devices, the method can proceed to block 320 and then to decision block 322.
At decision block 322, the method can detect whether a proximity mode associated with a site and energy network is enabled or disabled. For example, proximity mode can include associating a mobile device with a residential site, and automatically controlling a network device based on detecting a location the mobile device may be from the residential site. One or more mobile devices associated with a site can include a location reporting device capable of outputting a location report. The location reporting device can use various technologies to report location including GPS, GPRS, cell tower triangulation, or various other location reporting technologies. In another form, a location reporting device of a mobile device can also include a WIFI radio capable of being connected to a WIFI network. As such, a mobile device can be connected to a WIFI network at the site using a WIFI connection, and as a WIFI connection is established or lost, a proximity mode can be enabled and disabled accordingly.
According to an aspect, at block 322 if proximity mode is enabled, the method can proceed to block 344 as described below. If at decision block 322 proximity mode may not be enabled, the method can proceed to decision block 324 to detect if a user schedule is available. For example, a user schedule can include an event schedule to control one or more network devices. According to an aspect, one or more users can create a schedule that can be accessed by a controller, and used to control one or more wireless thermostats or other network devices that can be joined to the energy network. According to a further aspect, a user schedule can be linked to a mobile device of the user. In some forms, the mobile device can include a location detection device configured to report locations of the mobile device.
According to an aspect, if a user schedule may not be detected, the method can proceed to block 356 and an event can be identified. For example, an event can include one or more programmed events that can be created and accessed at a specific time, date, period, or other to alter an operating condition of a network device. For example, a user may not have provided a user schedule to schedule energy use of a hot water system at a residence. As such, a default schedule can be accessed to identify an event and schedule or manage use of the hot water heater. For example, an event can include decreasing a hot water heater ten (10) degrees at midnight. Another event can include increasing a hot water heater fifteen (15) degrees at five (5) A.M. In another form, a network device can include a wireless thermostat that can be used to control an HVAC system based on a time of day or other attribute. For example, a weather forecast can be determined, and an event can be scheduled to adjust a wireless thermostat accessible to the energy network. Various other environmental conditions, grid conditions, user profiles, device profiles, energy pricing, or any combination of energy management information can be used to schedule or create an event.
Upon identifying an event, the method can proceed to decision block 326 and detect whether to schedule the event. For example, if an event is configured to be scheduled at a specific time of day, the method can detect the event at decision block 326. If an event may not be detected, the method can proceed to decision block 322 and repeats.
According to an aspect, if at decision block 326 an event should be scheduled, the method can proceed to block 328 and the event can be scheduled. For example, a network device can be identified, an operating condition to be altered can be identified, a time of day to alter the operating condition can be identified, a period of time to alter an operating condition can be identified, a device profile can be used, or any combination of data that can be used to schedule an event can be used. According to another aspect, the method can include initiating a scheduled event at block 328 using a portion of a programming schedule stored within a memory of the controller associated with the energy network. For example, portions of event data can be communicated from a remote server to the controller, and used with a programming schedule stored within the controller to schedule an event. In this manner, one or more sources can be used alone or in combination to schedule events.
According to a further aspect, upon scheduling the event, the method can proceed to block 330 and a control action can to be communicated to a network device. For example, a control action can include control action data or device data sufficient to alter an operating condition of a network device. In some forms, data formatted according to a standard profile, such as a Zigbee Home Automation profile, Zigbee Energy Profile, and the like. In other forms, control action data can include a device identifier, a message format to output a message, a parameter or feature of a network device to alter, an updated set-point or operating condition of the network device, a network or security key, a date and time, or any combination thereof.
According to an aspect, the method can proceed to block 332 and the control action can be output to the energy network as an outgoing message and received by the network device as an incoming message. For example, the network device can detect the outgoing message communicated within the energy network using a unique identifier of the network device.
At block 334, upon the network device receiving the incoming message, a control action can be extracted from the incoming message and the operating condition at the network device can be altered using the control action data. For example, an dishwasher may be turned on, a clothes washer or dryer turned on, lights within a home can altered, a thermostat can be adjusted, a hot water hear can be adjusted, or various other types of control actions can be initiated as needed or desired.
At block 336, network device data can be obtained from the network device using the energy network. For example, a network device can receive a request to output operating status information as network device data to the energy network. In other forms, the network device can be enabled to periodically publish status information to the energy network and received by the controller. Upon outputting the network device data, the method can then proceed to block 338 and a site report can be generated. For example, a site report can include network device data received from one or more network devices accessible to the home energy network. Site report data can be stored locally to the controller, and processed to confirm an updating of the control action. The site report data can be stored within a site report and communicated to a remote server configurable to receive and process the site report data within a site report. According to an aspect, a site report can be communicated to a remote server configurable to receive site reports from the controller using a broadband connection initiated by the controller. Other forms of communication can also be used to communicate a site report as needed or desired. Upon generating a site report, the method can proceed to decision block 302.
According to an aspect, if at decision block 322 proximity detection may be enabled, the method can proceed to block 344 and a location report can be received. For example, a location report can include location data output from a location reporting device such as a mobile device. In other forms, a location report can be generated in response to a detection that a mobile device having a WIFI radio may be within range, or out of range, of the WIFI network at the site. As such, the method can be used to alter an operating condition of the network device using the energy network in response to detecting the location reporting device establishing or losing a WIFI connection to the WIFI network.
According to an aspect, the method can proceed to decision block 346 and can detect if a location change has occurred. If a location change has not occurred, the method can proceed to block 348 and detects whether to alter an operating condition. If an operating condition of one or more network devices may not be altered, the method can proceed to block 350, and to block 322.
According to another aspect, if at decision block 346 a location change may be detected, the method can proceed to block 350 and detects a distance a location reporting device may be from an associated site. The method can then proceed to block 352 and detects the direction of the mobile device. For example, if the distance has increased from a previous location reported, the method can detect that a user may be moving away from a site. In other forms, a detected direction can include moving toward a site, moving away from a site, or not moving at all.
Upon detecting a direction, the method can proceed to decision block 348 and detects whether to alter an operating condition of a network device. For example, in addition to detecting a distance and direction a user may be from a residence, various other types of information can also be used to alter an operating condition. For example, data such as real time velocity data, average velocity data, estimated length of time a user may take to return to a site, thermostat scheduling data, network device scheduling data, site report data, real-time weather condition data, traffic condition data, user driving pattern data, daily driving pattern data, GPS mapping data, home energy efficiency ratings, demand response data, curtailment data, energy pricing data, grid condition data, various other types of EMI, or any combination thereof.
Upon detecting an operating condition to alter, the method can proceed to block 354 and initiates a control action. For example, a server remote to a site can be used to generate a control action that can be included within a control action report and communicated to the controller at the site. In a form, the control action report can be communicated in association with an upload of a site report. According to another aspect, a control action can be generated by the controller. For example, a location and direction of a mobile device can be identified and communicated to the controller. The controller can then determine whether to generate a control action using the location data and direction data, and possible other data as needed or desired. The method can then proceed to block 328 as generally described above. If at decision block 348 an operating condition of a network device should not be altered, the method can proceed to block 350 and to block 322.
According to an aspect, the method can be provided to detect a distance between the location reporting device and the site using a previously stored location of the residence and a new location of the location reporting device. At decision block 354 altering an operating condition can include altering an operating condition of the network device in response to detecting the location reporting device is traveling away from the residence. Further, altering an operating condition of the network device in response to detecting the location reporting device is traveling toward the residence.
According to another aspect, the method can be provided to detect a location reporting device at a first distance at block 350, and at decision block 348 initiate a control action. As the location reporting device may be detected at a second distance, a second control action can be initiated. For example, a control action can include setting a first temperature set-point of a thermostat in response to detecting the first distance. The method can further be provided to detect the location reporting device at a second distance different from the first distance, and set the temperature set-point to a second value.
According to a further aspect, the method can be modified to detect an upper and lower thermostat set-point limits of a network device. For example, an upper set-point limit can include a maximum a temperature that should be reached within a site during a warm season. A set-point of a thermostat can then be determined by determining the difference between a previous set-point and the maximum set-point. In some forms, a percentage adjustment, such as 30%, 50%, 75%, etc. of the resulting difference between a maximum set-point and a base set point can be used to determine a new set-point. For example, if a thermostat is set to seventy (70) degrees and has a maximum set-point of eighty (80) degrees, the delta between the two being ten (10) degrees. A new set-point can then be generated by multiplying this delta by a percentage, such as 50%, and adding it to the current set point. In this example, a new setting of seventy five (75) degrees would be the resulting set-point. In other forms, the method can use the maximum and minimum set-points, resulting or current set-points, in association with a time of day, a distance or distances a user may be from a site, or various other data that can be used to determine a set-point using maximum and minimum set-point values.

One or more of the modules, profiles, or any combination thereof can be provided as encoded logic such as a ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or various combinations thereof and accessible to processor 402 as needed or desired. In other forms, one or more of the modules, profiles, or any combination thereof can be stored within a memory device such as memory 404, within a removable flash drive (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 4), an external data storage device (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 4), or any combination thereof.
According to further aspect, controller 400 can include processor 402 operable to manage energy use at a site. Processor 400 can be configured to convert an incoming message received from a wireless energy network (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 4) into XML enabled output data. Processor 400 can also format an outgoing message to be output to a wireless energy network using XML enabled input data. According to an aspect, XML enabled input data includes a network device identifier of a network device accessible using a wireless energy network. Controller 400 can also include communication interface 430 configurable to enable access to communication device, such as Zigbee device 422, WIFI device 424, AMI device 426, or any other device accessible to controller 400 and having access to a wireless energy network. According to an aspect, communication interface 430 can be configured to detect an outgoing message formatted by processor 402 and configure the outgoing message to a message bus format that can be coupled to bus 408 and a communication device such as Zigbee device 422. For example, outgoing message can include network device data configured to be output to a wireless energy network, but processed into a message bus format prior to outputting to a communication device. Communication interface 430 can then convert the outgoing message from a message bus format to a format that can be output by a specific communication device. For example, if the outgoing message was intended to be output using WIFI device 424, communication interface can detect that the message was to be sent on a WIFI network and can convert the outgoing message from a message bus format to a WIFI device format. Communication interface 430 can then output the WIFI device formatted message to WIFI device 424.
According to a further aspect, communication interface 430 can be configured to detect an incoming message received from a wireless energy network using a communication device such as Zigbee device 422, WIFI device 424, AMI device 426, or any other device accessible to controller 400 and having access to a wireless energy network. Incoming message can include incoming network device data received from a network device. Communication interface 430 can convert an incoming message from a communication device format to access an incoming network device data received from a network device, and output the incoming network device data using a message bus format that can be used by processor 402.
According to another aspect, controller 400 can include a wireless data module, such as Zigbee device 422, WIFI device 424, AMI device 426, or any other device accessible to controller 400 and having access to a wireless energy network. A wireless data module can be accessible to processor 402 and configured to generate profile data to be used with an outgoing message. For example, processor 402 can access network device profile module 434 and use a network device profile of a network device accessible to the wireless energy network to output a message receivable by a specific network device. Network device data can be formatted using a network device profile of a specific network type of the wireless energy network. In some forms, a network device profile may not include information sufficient to output network device data. As such, profile modifiers 448 can be provided and can include profile modification data of the network device not available within the network device profiles 442 that can be used to communicate with a network device coupled to an energy network accessible to controller 400.
For example, device profiles 442 can include a Zigbee thermostat device profile having home automation profile data and smart energy profile data. Profile modification data 448 can be used to access additional profile information to format an outgoing Zigbee message and access a Zigbee enabled thermostat coupled to a wireless energy network accessible to controller 400. In this manner, additional features and functionality that may not exist within Zigbee profile standards can be accessed by using profile modifier data 448. As such, functionality of a Zigbee enabled device can be expanded beyond a standard Zigbee profile.
According to another aspect, controller 400 can include a first user profile stored within user profiles 444 and accessible to processor 402. For example, a first user profile can include a first time schedule to operate a network device and a control setting to control the network device.

The second user profile can also include a second user identifier to identify the second user and a network device identifier to identify the network device.
According to a further aspect, processor 402 can determine when to use a first user profile or a second user profile. For example, processor 402 can access user profiles 444 to detecting the user profiles, and initiate outputting an outgoing message using the first user schedule or the second user schedule. Processor 402 can then be used to monitor when to alter the operating condition provided by the first user schedule, to an operating condition of a second user schedule. In this manner, multiple user schedules can be used by controller 400 to control a network device.
According to a further aspect, processor 402 can be used to detect an input to a network device as a user schedule is being used, and store a new setting of the network device in association with the deployed user schedule. For example, processor 402 can detect a current user profile being used, and further detect an interaction with a network device during use of a first user schedule. Upon detecting an interaction, processor 402 can initiate an update to the first user profile in response to detecting the interaction.
According to an aspect, processor 402 can be used to convert data received using broadband device 414 to a format that can be output to a wireless energy network.

According to an aspect, controller 400 can use communication interface 430 and API 440 to enable access to ZigBee device 422 operably coupled to bus 408 and accessible to API 440. As such API 440 can be used by processor 402 during use of one or more modules to access Zigbee device 422, WIFI device 424, AMI device, 426 or any combination thereof to communicate network data using a wireless energy network. As such, processor 402 can make API calls to API 440 to access various functions of one or more communication devices 422, 424, 426.
According to another aspect, controller 400, can be used to coordinate a wireless energy network, and use data within the wireless energy network that was received from an external information source accessible to controller 400. For example, broadband device 414 can be coupled to an information network. Broadband device 414 can further be coupled to information network interface 416 operable to access external data sources that can be communicatively coupled to broadband device 414. Controller 400 can initiate coordinating a wireless energy network, and initiate outputting XML enabled output data as site report data to information network interface 416 to be communicated to an external data source using broadband device 414. Site report data can include a portion or representation of network device data received by Zigbee device 422, or other device accessing the wireless energy network. According to an aspect, controller 400 can also receive control action report data using broadband device 414. For example, control action report data can include XML enabled input data that can be output as network device data using the wireless energy network.
According to a further aspect, controller 400 can be configured to access a wireless energy network at more than one security level. For example, processor 402 can use security module 434 configured to initiate supporting coordinating a wireless energy network at a first security level and enable access to a network device at a first security level. For example, processor 402 can initiate receipt of an incoming message using Zigbee device 422 at the first security level. Upon gaining access and communicating device data, processor 402 can disconnect the network device. In another form, security module 434 and processor 402 can then initiate access to a second network device at a second security level using Zigbee device 422, and enable access to the second network device using the second security level. Processor 402 can initiate receipt of a second incoming message at the second security level, and upon receipt of device data disable access to the second network device. As such, controller 400 can use a single Zigbee device 422 to access multiple network devices using more than one security level.
According to an aspect, controller 400 can be used to access more than one wireless energy network. For example, processor 402 can initiate using a first wireless communication device, such as Zigbee device 422, to coordinate a first wireless energy network. Processor 402 can also initiate using a second wireless communication device, such as a second Zigbee device (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 4), or other wireless device, to coordinate a second wireless energy network. As such, processor 402 can access one or more network devices coupled to one or more wireless energy networks. According to another aspect, a second Zigbee device, or other wireless device can be used to join a second wireless energy network instead of coordinating the second wireless energy network. For example, the second wireless energy network can include an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enabled network operably associated with an AMI enabled smart meter. AMI device 426 can include a second ZigBee device, or other wireless communication device, capable of joining an AMI enabled network of an AMI enabled smart meter (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 4). As such, smart meter data can be accessed by controller 400 as needed or desired. For example, AMI data or smart meter data can be obtained on a periodic basis and communicated in association with a site report having network device data. As such, broadband device 414, wireless information network device 418, or other information network devices can be used to site report data that can include AMI data acquired using controller 400.
According to another aspect, controller 400 can use AMI device 426 to access an AMI enabled smart meter to alter an operating condition of a network device accessible to controller 400 using Zigbee device 422. For example, AMI device 426 can include an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enabled interface capable of initiating access to an AMI enabled smart meter. Controller 400 can use AMI device 426 to receive AMI data from an AMI enabled smart meter. Processor 402 can be used to initiate altering an operating condition of a network device in response to detecting AMI data received from the AMI enabled smart meter. Processor 402 can further be used to detect a smart energy control request output by an AMI enabled smart meter, and initiate using the smart energy control request at the network device.
In some forms, a control request may be obviated by controller 400 by not allowing an AMI initiated control request to be enabled. For example, processor 402 can access home profiles 446 and determine whether a control action initiated by an AMI enabled smart meter should be enabled or disabled. As such, controller 400 can be used to monitor control actions being output by an AMI enabled smart meter or other utility provided system, and alter the request as desired. For example, a user may create a home profile 446 that would not allow for a curtailment action of a network device. In other forms, home profile 446 may enable a curtailment action over a period or schedule, and disable a curtailment action over another period or schedule. As such, controller 400 can determine a valid period or schedule to enable and disable a curtailment action initiated by an AMI enabled smart meter.
According to a further aspect, controller 400 can reset an operating condition in the event an AMI enabled smart meter alters an operating condition of a network device. For example, an AMI enabled smart meter may be able to control a network device. Controller 400 can monitor an operating condition of the network device, and in the event an operating condition has been altered to a setting that is not scheduled by controller 400, controller 400 can respond to the operating condition by notifying a user, or automatically altering the operating condition to a preferred setting.
According to another aspect, controller 400 can be used to access an information network outside of the wireless home energy network. For example, information network interface 416 can be configured to access an information network using broadband device 414, wireless information network device 418, external bus interface 420, or any combination thereof. According to an aspect, wireless information network device 418 can include a subscriber based network device, or in other forms can include a WIFI network access device, or various combinations thereof.

As such, a user having a WIFI enable communication device can be coupled to controller 400 using WIFI device 424 and monitor, create and manage operating conditions, home profiles, user profiles, device profiles, user schedules, proximity detection, demand response preferences, energy savings preferences, other control settings, view site data, or any combination thereof. Other settings and operating conditions can be accessed, monitored, or managed as needed or desired.
According to another aspect, controller 400 can include proximity detection module 438 that can be accessed by processor 402 to enable and disable proximity control at a site. For example, proximity detection module 438 and processor can be used to detect a distance between a mobile device having a location reporting device and the site. Processor 402 can be used to identify a current operating condition of a network device, and identify an updated operating condition of the network device in response to the detected distance. Processor 402 can be used to initiate generation of an outgoing message to include an updated operating condition in response to the distance. According to a further aspect, controller 400 can be configured to receive location data using an information network having a server configured to communicate location data associated with a mobile device having a location reporting device that is associated with a site. Location data can be stored within memory 404 and used to monitor a distance and direction between a site and the mobile device. As such, controller 400 can initiate control actions using the location data, and the location data need not be stored in a server remotely located to a site. Various control actions can be generated using various types of conditions including detecting a distance, determining a control zone having a distance or interval, travel pattern of a mobile device, monitoring current and future weather data, monitoring real-time traffic data, monitoring energy pricing data, monitoring home efficiency data, or using any combination of energy management information in association with providing proximity control of a site.

For example, processor 400 can be used to convert an incoming message received from a wireless energy network using the Zigbee device 422 into XML enabled output data. Processor 402 can format an outgoing message to be output to a wireless energy network using XML enabled input data that includes a network device identifier of a network device accessible using a wireless energy network. Communication interface 430 can be configured to detect the outgoing message formatted by processor 402 to be output using the wireless energy network, and configure the outgoing message to a message bus format to be output to communication bus 408. In some forms, the outgoing message can include network device data configured to be output to a wireless energy network. Communication interface 430 can further detect an incoming message received from a wireless energy network that includes incoming network device data. Communication interface 430 can be used to convert the incoming message accessed from bus 408 from the message bus format to detect incoming network device data that can be output to processor 402. Processor 402 can then be used to generate site data including the network device data, and a site report that can be communicated using information network interface 416.

According to a further aspect, server 602 can also use energy personality detection module 678 to detect an interaction profile of a user. For example, a user may be an urban professional having a long work commute which may result in a first portion of a utilization schedule. Upon arriving at a residential site, a user may interact with their thermostat to which will result in a different portion of a utilization schedule. For example, a user may like an indoor temperature to be colder when going to bed. As such, a personality of the user while away and while at home can be used to automatically generate a user's schedule. According to another aspect, an energy personality indicia or character can be generated and output with a user's on-line scheduling tool, within a user's social network, or any combination thereof. For example, processor 606 can detect an interaction of a user with a wireless thermostat, and display of an energy personality indicia in response to the interaction. A user can then enable or disable display of the energy personality indicia within a social network such as FacebookÂ®, MySpaceÂ®, etc. In other forms, processor 606 can be used to modify the indicia based on an overall energy savings a user has accomplished at their residential site. For example, processor 606 can use energy savings module 670 to determine an energy savings of the individual and alter the energy personality indicia accordingly. In another form, a user can set up a messaging service or account using TwitterÂ® and the like to output energy savings updates to a subscriber base in response to an energy saving initiate, participating in demand response events, alter energy use, or various other forms. According to a further aspect, a TwitterÂ® account or other messaging service can be used on a community basis to inform a group of individuals of energy management events. For example, an âenergy action dayâ or âenergy alertsâ can be posted using a TwitterÂ® account to subscribers and a subscriber can curtail energy use using energy management system 600 or various other energy management systems as needed or desired. Other forms of messaging or any combination thereof can be used as needed or desired.
According to another aspect, server 602 can be used to determine a sample size of residential sites and corresponding schedules to forecast energy consumption over an interval. For example, processor 606 can be used to determine a random sample size of residential sites in connection with estimating an energy consumption of a specific region such as a zip code, street or series of streets, substations supporting residential sites, node-to-node, or any combination thereof or other methods of determining a region. Upon identifying a sample size of a region, residential sites can be identified within the region. For example, processor 606 can then determine associated thermostat schedules of residential sites within the specified region using scheduling module 648. Server 602 can output thermostat scheduling data of the plurality of sites in connection with scheduling or forecasting energy use.
According to another aspect, server 602 can also be used to enable a demand response initiated at site 604. For example, processor 606 can use demand response module 668 to detect an enabled demand response setting of site 604. Processor 606 can further detect a demand response event condition and enable a curtailment action of HVAC 630 if a user of site 604 has selected participation in a demand response event.

According to a further aspect, controller 1302 can initiate a control action or energy management schedule in response to a distance an associated mobile device 1324 may be from site 1304. For example, a first user energy management schedule may be deployed as a first user having mobile device 1324 may be located at or near site 1302. As mobile device 1324 moves away from site 1302 (e.g. one mile, three miles, etc.), a second user energy management schedule can be initiated and used by controller 1302. In this manner, proximity detection of mobile device 1324 can be used to initiate a second user energy schedule.
According to another aspect, mobile device 1324 can output scheduling data, control action data, energy management data, and the like using third network 1322 configured as a WIFI enabled network. For example, mobile device 1324 can include an application or scheduling logic capable of initiating a user energy management schedule. Mobile device 1324 can encode or output control action data, and communicate the control action data, scheduling data, and the like using a WIFI protocol and messaging format.
According to an aspect, controller 1302 can include detect when mobile device 1324 may be connected to third network 1322 and modify operation of a network device accessible to controller 1302. For example, mobile device 1324 can be coupled to third network 1322 operable as a WIFI network, or other network capable of being deployed at site 1304. As mobile device 1324 moves away from site 1304 and a network connection to third network 1322 may be altered, controller 1302 can detect a change in connectivity (e.g. weak signal, signal is lost, connection switches to another hub, station, controller, and the like) to third network 1322, a connection status of wireless device 1312 can be output to communication interface 1306 and accessed by application program interface 1306. As such, controller 1302 can detect whether to alter use of a resource or network device accessible to controller 1302. For example, mobile device 1324 may be connected to third network 1322 using a WIFI connection. As a WIFI connection is altered, controller 1302 can initiate altering an operating condition of a resources such as TSTAT 1320, one or more wireless devices 1308, 1310, 1312, or various other resources accessible to controller 1302. For example, if a second user may be located at site 1304, a second user energy management schedule that may be different from the first user energy management schedule can be deployed. For example, a first portion of a second energy management schedule of a second user can be enabled in response to the operating status of the resource,
According to another aspect, wireless device 1312 that may have been configured to be coupled to third network 1322 can be placed in a reduced operating condition to save power consumed by controller 1302. In another form, proximity detection of mobile device 1324 can be initiated to detect a location of mobile device 1324 when a WIFI connection or other connection is altered. Additionally, mobile device 1324 may also alter an operating condition by disabling a WIFI connection to third network 1322. Mobile device 1324 can also initiate location reporting of mobile device 1324, and controller 1302 can alter an operating condition of a network device or resource in response to mobile device 1324 being at a distance from site 1304.

Additionally, the method can be embodied in various types of encoded logic including software, firmware, hardware, or other forms of digital storage mediums, computer readable mediums, or logic, or any combination thereof, operable to provide all, or portions, of the method of FIG. 16.
The method begins generally at block 1600. At block 1602, an acquisition interval to acquire network device data can be detected. For example, network device data can be acquired using a wireless energy network having one or more network devices accessible to the wireless energy network. For example, a wireless energy network can include various types of wireless networks configured to communicated information to manage energy use of a network devices accessible to the wireless network. For example, a wireless energy network can include one or more of any combination or portion of, IEEE 802.15-based wireless communication, Zigbee communication, INSETEON communication, X10 communication protocol, Z-Wave communication, Bluetooth communication, WWI communication, IEEE 802.11-based communication, WiMAX communication, IEEE 802.16-based communication, various proprietary wireless communications, or any combination thereof.
At decision block 1604, the method can detect whether an acquisition interval may be updated. For example, an acquisition interval can be set to a first interval (such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes etc.), and can then be altered to another interval. According to an aspect, an acquisition interval can be altered in response to a distance a mobile device may be from a site. For example, as a user moves away from a site, an acquisition interval can be increased (e.g. changed from 1 minute to 3 minutes). Similarly, as a mobile device move towards a site, an acquisition interval can be decreased (e.g. changed from 3 minutes to 1 minute). Various combinations of intervals can be used as needed or desired. If at decision block 1604 an acquisition interval has been updated, the method can proceed to block 1606 and an updated interval can be obtained. If at decision block 1604 an acquisition interval has not been changed, the method can proceed to block 1608.
According to an aspect, at block 1608, device data can be acquired. For example, device data can be obtained by sending a request to one or more network devices joined to a wireless energy network. For example, multiple devices can be accessed at an acquisition interval to obtain device data. Device data can be provided in various forms and types of information. According to an aspect, device data can include a device identifier, a network identifier, operation data, security data, various other types of data that can be used to manage energy use, or any combination thereof. According to a further aspect, device data can be formatted based on a wireless communication protocol (e.g. Zigbee, WIFI, WiMax, etc.) being deployed as the wireless energy network.
According to another aspect, the method can be modified to detect an availability of one or more network devices. For example, a first network device may be accessible to a wireless energy network and may use a first device profile to communicate information using the wireless energy network. Additionally, a second network device may be accessible to the wireless energy network and may use a second device profile that may be different from the first.
Upon acquiring device data from one or more network devices, the device data can be translated at step 1610. For example, the device data may be formatted using a device profile, communication protocol, or various other formats to communicate device data using a wireless energy network. At block 1610, device data can be translated into another format to use by another system, process, device, etc. other than the wireless energy network. For example, Zigbee formatted data can be translated into XML encoded data. According to another aspect, device data can be translated to an data object, such as a Java object and the like. Various other translations can also be used.
The method can then proceed to block 1612 and a report interval can be detected. According to an aspect, a report interval can include an interval that may be the same as the acquisition interval, greater than the acquisition interval, or less than the acquisition interval. According to a particular aspect, the report interval can be twice as long as the acquisition interval. As such, exact timing of when to acquire device data can be obviated as at least one data acquisition may be available to generate a report.
At decision block 1614, if a report interval should not be updated, the method can proceed to block 1618 as described below. If a report interval should be updated, the method can proceed to block 1616 and an updated report interval may be obtained. According to an aspect, a report interval can be provided using a data acquisition interval. For example, a report interval can be updated in association with an acquisition interval being updated. In other forms, a report interval can be provided and updated without an acquisition interval being updated. Various combinations of updating a report interval, acquisition interval, or any combination thereof can be used. Upon updating a report interval, the method can proceed to block 1618.
According to an aspect, at block 1618 report data can be generated. For example, report data can include data that can be provided within a site report and can be formatted in various ways. For example, report data can include a XML encoded data, Java objects, textual data or various combinations thereof. According to an aspect, network device data can be converted to a binary representation. For example, to reduce the amount of information to be communicated, a binary representation can include one or more binary bits within a data field that can represent portions or all of the network device data. According to a further aspect, report data can be stored on a device basis until a site report can be generated.
Upon generating report data, the method can proceed to block 1620 and generates a site report. For example, a site report can include data received from one or more network devices. In another form, site report data can include data from another source, device, network, or any combination thereof capable of providing data that can be used within a site report. For example, a home controller may include a data and time setting based on a current time zone. A network device may not have a current or updated date and time stamp provided with the network device data. As such, a current date and time stamp can be provided with the site report data. In other forms, data obtained from another source (e.g. WIFI network, AMI network, WiMax network, etc.) can be provided within a site report. For example, a site report can include network device data that includes a thermostat or HVAC system being placed in an âonâ condition. Additionally, an AMI network can be accessed to detect a current energy consumption level, rate, price, savings or various other types of information that can be provided using an AMI network. The AMI network data can be combined with the network device data within a site report. As such, subsequent processing of site reports can include additional information that can be processed into a rite report to manage and report energy use at a site. Other types and combinations of EMI data from various network locations can be included within a site report as needed or desired.
Upon generating a site report, the method can proceed to block 1622 and a network connection can be initiated. For example, a rested web services approach to making a network connection can be deployed to realize increased network security at a site. For example, a home controller can be used to initiate a network connection using a LAN, broadband network, wireless data network, WiMax network, WIFI network, or various other networks or combinations of networks. A specific network location can be accessed on a secure basis using SSL or other encryption methods. At decision block 1624, if a network may not be available, the method can proceed to block 1626 and store the site report until the network may become available. The method can then proceed to block 1608 as described herein. If at decision block 1624 a network location may be available, the method can proceed to block 1630 and initiates a transfer of a site report. According to an aspect, if multiple site reports are available, the method can initiate a transfer of the multiple site reports.
Upon initiating transfer of the site reports, the method can proceed to block 1632 and can initiate processing site report data at a network location. For example, a network location can include a server configured to process site report data and store site report data within a database. Additional processing of the data can be realized as needed or desired. For example, server 602 described in FIG. 6 includes several modules that can be used to process site report data.
Upon initiating processor of site report data, the method can processed to decision block 1634 to detect if a control action may be available. For example, a control action field or flag associated with a specific site and one or more network devices can be provided within a database or other storage location. In another form, one or more binary values can be used to indicate if control action data be available. If control action may be available, the method can proceed to block 1636 and a control action can be received. For example, a control action can be communicated during a session and can include one or more actions associated with a network device accessible at a site. According to an aspect, a control action can be encoded based on a profile, (e.g. Zigbee Profile, Smart Energy Profile, Home Automation, etc.). In other forms, a control action can be formatted as XML encoded data, HTML encoded data, proprietary data format, or any combination thereof.
Upon receiving a control action at block 1636, or if a control action may not be available, the method can proceed to decision block 1638 and detects if an interval should be updated. For example, an acquisition interval, report interval, or any combination thereof can be available. If an interval should be updated, the method can proceed to block 1640 and one or more intervals can be received and updated. According to an aspect, if an interval may be updated, an update flag can be set to indicate a new or updated interval can be used. In other forms, a current interval field can be updated with a new interval value. If at decision block 1638, an interval may not be updated, the method can proceed to decision block 1642 as described below.
According to an aspect, at decision block 1642 the method can detect if an update may be available. For example, an update can include one or more new or updated profiles that can be used at a site in association with an energy network. In another form, a software or firmware update can be available to update a network device, home controller, or various other systems, apparatuses, methods, devices, or any combination thereof that can be used at a site. If an update may be available, the method can proceed to block 1644 and a method can be received and processed at block 1646 as needed or desired. According to an aspect, an update may be available at another network location. As such, the method can be modified to include an update available flag or data, and another network location can be accessed to receive an update. If at decision block 1642 an update may not be available, the method can proceed to block 1648 as needed or desired.
According to an aspect, at block 1648, the method can disconnect from a network location and proceed to block 1650. If a control action may have been received, the method can processor the control action data, and proceed to block 1652 to detect a control action within the control action data. According to an aspect, a control action can include various combinations of actions such as obtaining or reading an operating status or value of one or more network device attributes, altering an operating condition of network device, updating an operating schedule of a network device, or various other control actions as needed or desired. In another form, control action data can be stored within a memory and deployed based on a schedule. As such, a period of time (e.g. twelve hours, twenty four hours, etc.) can be stored and deployed in the event of an information network failure at a site.
Upon detecting control action data, the method can proceed to block 1654 and can process control action data. For example, if control action data should be stored, the method can store control action data and deploy at a later time. In another form, control action data can be processed into a format that can be used to output network device data. For example, control action data can be processed into one or more JAVA objects, XML files, or other formats to include a received control action data of a specific device. According to an aspect, a network device can include a specific profile to access features of a network device. As such, control action data can be processed based on a specific profile.
Upon processing control action data, the method can proceed to block 1656 and the processed control action data can be generated into network device data. For example, a network may be deployed to provide an energy network at a site. As such, a protocol to communicate device data as network device data can be deployed. In other forms, a communication device can be coupled to a USB port, UART port, SPI port, other buses, or combinations thereof. As such, control action data can be formatted into a format that can be communicated using a specific bus having a wireless network device or module coupled to a bus. For example, for example. At block 1656 network device data can be formatted to be communicated using a USB bus having Zigbee communication module coupled to the USB bus. In other forms, a network device, such as a wireless WWI device can be coupled to a UART bus and accessed to output control action data. Upon generating network device data, the method can proceed to block 1658 and the network device data can be output to a communication module that can output the control action data to the network device. The method can then proceed to block 1660, and to block 1602 as needed or desired.
According to another aspect, the present disclosure and include an installation system and method configured to install a system at a site. For example, FIG. 6 described herein includes controller 626 and thermostat 628 installed at a site 604. Installation can include controller 626 including a serial number (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 6), or other unique identifier. Thermostat 628 can also include a serial number (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 6) or other unique identifier. Upon a user or agent installing controller 626, an identifier of controller 626, thermostat 628, or any combination thereof, can be communicated to server 602 to authenticate site 604 and enable energy management at site 604.
According to another aspect, an installation can include controller 626 requesting a list of valid identifiers of one or more network devices that can be installed at site 604. For example, controller 626 can receive a list of one or more valid network devices that may be installed at site 604, and can validate one or more installed devices. For example, controller 626 can detect a network device accessible using an energy network deployed at site 604. A network device can communicate an identifier and controller 626 can detect whether the communicated identifier may be within the list communicated by server 602. As such, an agent that may have an inventory of network devices, controllers, or any combination thereof can install a controller and a network device without having to determine a valid serial number.
According to a further aspect, an installation can include using a mobile device including installation logic, one or more applications, settings, or any combination thereof. For example, mobile device 632 illustrated in FIG. 6 or other mobile devices or systems can be used to install portions or all of an energy management system at site 604. For example, a user can deploy an energy management application on mobile device 632 and can input a serial number or other identifier to into an energy management application. In this manner, a user may modify network devices installed at site 604 by for example, adding new devices, updating new devices, deleting current devices, receiving software updates using a serial number of an installed device, or various combinations thereof. According to a further aspect, an installation, settings, and the like can include prompting a user to use a GPS location in connection with an installation and site 604. As such, a user need not type in an address and can just select a current location to associate mobile device 632 and site 604.
According to another aspect, an installation can include using RFID, bar code, network scan, or various other hands-free identification processes. For example, mobile device 632 can include an energy management application that can include an installation or set-up that includes reading a bar code label of controller 626, TSTAT 628, various other network devices, or any combination thereof. For example, a user can scan a barcode that can include a unique identifier of controller 626, TSTAT 628, or any combinations thereof. According to an aspect, a bar code label can be affixed to a portion of a housing (not expressly illustrated in FIG. 6). In other forms, a bar code can be accessed using a display, such as a display of TSAT 626 or other network devices or systems that can display one or more bar codes (e.g. outputting multiple at a single system, network device, installation sheet or stickers, etc.). Upon a user scanning a bar code label, the installation process can use a network connection, such as WIFI or other wireless data networks to communicate unique data and authenticate a system. An server, such as server 602 can authenticate the data and activate a user's account. According to an aspect, a user can also set a location using a current GPS location of mobile device 632 at site 604. In this manner, and installation process that can include authenticating or activating software on a mobile device, a home controller, a network device, and a server account can be coordinated in an efficient manner thereby reducing the need to have an installation technician or other third party activate an account. Various combinations of associating devices, systems, controllers, mobile devices, etc. can be used to activate portions or all of an energy network using hands-free RF, optical scanning devices, or any combination thereof. According to a further aspect, an installation can be modified to allow a third party technician install a system and can include scanning one or more bar codes that may be affixed to a network device, controller, etc. In other forms, a third party technician can scan bar code labels or other devices and affix the labels to a device, controller, system, etc. in association with an installation. As such, inventory management can also be maintained in association with installing a controller, network device, system, etc.
