FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention teaches customized articles of footwear including removable and replaceable components, and methods of making the same.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element which can provide improved cushioning, stability, and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry, a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper, insole, spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired. Further, the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly, the article of footwear can be customized by an individual wearer or specially configured for a select target population in order to optimize desired performance criteria. Moreover, the present invention teaches a method of making an article of footwear, and also a way of doing both retail and Internet business.
Conventional athletic footwear typically include an outsole made of a thermoset rubber compound which is affixed by adhesive to a midsole made of ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane foam material which is in turn affixed by adhesive to an upper which is constructed with the use of stitching and adhesives. Because of the difficulty, time, and expense associated with renewing any portion of conventional articles of footwear, the vast majority are generally discarded at the end of their service life. This service life can be characterized as having a short duration when a wearer frequently engages in athletic activity such as distance running or tennis. In tennis, portions of the outsole can be substantially abraded within a few hours, and in distance running the foam midsole can become compacted and degrade by taking a compression set within one hundred miles of use. The resulting deformation of the foam midsole can degrade cushioning and footwear stability, thus contribute to the origin of athletic injuries. Accordingly, many competitive distance runners who routinely cover one hundred miles in a week's time will discard their athletic footwear after logging three hundred miles in order to avoid possible injury.
Even though the service life of conventional athletic footwear is relatively short, the price of athletic footwear has steadily increased over the last three decades, and some models now bear retail prices over one hundred and twenty dollars. However, some of this increase in retail prices has been design and fashion driven as opposed to reflecting actual value added. In any case, conventional athletic footwear remain disposable commodities and few are being recycled. The method of manufacture and disposal of conventional athletic footwear is therefore relatively inefficient and not environmentally friendly. In contrast with conventional athletic footwear, the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can include a spring element which does not take a compression set or similarly degrade, thus the physical and mechanical properties afforded by a preferred article of footwear can remain substantially the same over a useful service life which can be several times longer than that of conventional articles of footwear. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which represents an investment, as opposed to a disposable commodity. Like an automobile, the preferred article of footwear includes components which can be easily renewed and replaced, but also components which can be varied and customized, as desired.
Published examples of devices and means for selectively and removably affixing various components of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 997,657, 1,219,507, 2,183,277, 2,200,080, 2,220,534, 2,552,943, 2,588,061, 2,640,283, 2,873,540, 3,012,340, 3,373,510, 3,538,628, 3,818,617, 3,846,919, 3,878,626, 3,906,646, 3,982,336, 4,103,440, 4,107,857, 4,132,016, 4,262,434, 4,267,650, 4,279,083, 4,300,294, 4,317,294, 4,351,120, 4,377,042, 4,420,894, 4,535,554, 4,538,368, 4,606,139, 4,747,220, 4,807,372, 4,825,563, 4,850,122, 4,887,369, 5,042,175, 5,083,385, 5,317,822, 5,339,544, 5,367,791, 5,381,610, 5,410,821, 5,533,280, 5,542,198, 5,615,497, 5,628,129, 5,661,915, 5,644,857, 5,657,558, 5,661,915, 5,678,327, 5,692,319, 5,729,916, 5,799,417, 5,822,888, 5,826,352, 5,896,608, 5,991,950, 6,023,857, 6,023,859, 6,145,221, 6,151,805, 6,247,249 B1, 6,282,814 B1, 6,324,772 B1, 6,332,281 B1, 6,349,486 B1, 6,931,766, and patent applications WO 97/46127 and WO 02/13641 A1, all of these patents and patent applications hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
Conventional athletic footwear cannot be substantially customized for use by the customer or wearer. The physical and mechanical properties of conventional athletic footwear are relatively fixed generic qualities. However, the body weight or mass and characteristic running technique of different individuals having the same footwear size can vary greatly. Often, the stiffness in compression of the foam material used in the midsole of athletic shoes can be too soft for individuals who employ more forceful movements, or who have greater body mass than an average wearer. Accordingly, conventional articles of athletic footwear do not provide optimal performance characteristics for individual wearers.
In contrast, the present invention permits a wearer to customize a preferred article of footwear. For example, the length, width, girth, and configuration of the upper, as provided by various last options, or by two or three dimensional modeling and footwear design equipment including computer software and data storage and retrieval systems, or by two or three dimensional measurement devices such as scanners, as well as the type of footwear construction and design of the upper can be selected by the customer or wearer. Further, the physical and mechanical properties of the article of footwear can be selected and changed as desired in order to optimize desired performance characteristics given various performance criteria or environmental conditions. For example, the configuration and geometry of the article of footwear, and the stiffness of the spring elements can be customized, as desired. In addition, the ability to easily remove, renew, and recycle the outsole portions of the preferred article of footwear can render the use of softer materials having enhanced shock and vibration dampening characteristics, but perhaps diminished wear properties, viable from a practical standpoint. Moreover, the outsole portion of the preferred article of footwear can be selected from a variety of options with regards to configuration, materials, and function.
The physical and mechanical properties associated with an article of footwear of the present invention can provide enhanced cushioning, stability, and running economy relative to conventional articles of footwear. The spring to dampening ratio of conventional articles of footwear is commonly in the range between 40-60 percent, whereas the preferred article of footwear can provide a higher spring to dampening ratio, thus greater mechanical efficiency and running economy. In this regard, the article of footwear can include a spring element that underlies the forefoot area which can store energy during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle, and then release this energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase, thus facilitating improved running economy. It is believed the resulting improvement in running performance can approximate one second over four hundred meters when running at four minutes/mile pace.
The preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the rearfoot area so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of pronation, or alternately, the rate and magnitude of supination experienced by an individual wearer, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. Likewise, the preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the midfoot and forefoot areas so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of inward and/or outward rotation of the foot, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. The preferred spring elements can also provide a stable platform which can prevent or reduce the amount of deformation caused by point loads, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury.
The use of relatively soft outsole materials having improved shock and vibration dampening characteristics can enhance cushioning effects. Further, in conventional articles of footwear, the shock and vibration generated during rearfoot impact is commonly transmitted most rapidly to a wearer through that portion of the outsole and midsole which has greatest stiffness, and this is normally a portion of the sole which is proximate the heel of the wearer that undergoes the greatest deflection and deformation. However, in the present invention a void space can exist beneath the heel of a wearer and the ground engaging portion of the outsole. Some of the shock and vibration generated during the rearfoot impact of an outsole with the ground support surface must then travel a greater distance through the outsole and inferior spring element in order to be transmitted to the superior spring element and a wearer. In addition, in the present invention, a posterior spacer which can serve as a shock and vibration isolator, and also vibration decay time modifiers can be used to decrease the magnitude of the shock and vibration transmitted to the wearer of a preferred article of footwear.
There are many published examples of attempts to introduce functional spring elements into articles of footwear, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 357,062, 1,088,328, 1,107,894, 1,113,266, 1,352,865, 1,370,212, 2,444,865, 2,447,603, 2,456,102, 2,508,318, 3,333,353, 4,429,474, 4,492,046, 4,314,413, 4,486,964, 4,506,460, 4,566,206, 4,771,554, 4,854,057, 4,878,300, 4,942,677, 5,042,175, 5,052,130, 5,060,401, 5,138,776, 5,159,767, 5,203,095, 5,279,051, 5,337,492, 5,343,639, 5,353,523, 5,367,790, 5,381,608, 5,437,110, 5,461,800, 5,528,842, 5,596,819, 5,636,456, 5,647,145, 5,678,327, 5,701,686, 5,729,916, 5,822,886, 5,875,567, 5,937,544, 5,940,994, 6,029,374, 6,195,915, 6,247,249 B1, 6,282,814 B1, 6,327,795, 6,330,757, 6,324,772 B1, 6,393,731 B1, 6,416,610, French Patent 472,735, Italian Patent 633,409, European Patent Applications EP 0 890 321 A2, EP 1 048 233 A2, EP 1 033 087 A1, EP 1 025 770 A2, EP 1 240 838 A1, and PCT Patent Application WO 98/07341, all of these patents and patent applications hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Relatively few of these attempts have resulted in functional articles of footwear which have met with commercial success. The limitations of some of the prior art has concerned the difficulty of meeting the potentially competing criteria associated with cushioning and footwear stability. In other cases, the manufacturing costs of making prior art articles of footwear including spring elements have been prohibitive. Articles of footwear including discrete foam cushioning elements which have been commercialized include the Nike âSHOX,â the Adidas âa3â which is believed to be taught in European Patent Application EP 1 240 838 A1, the Avia âECS Cushioningâ and Avia âECS Stability,â and also the Dada âSoleSonic Force.â
The spring element and various other novel structures taught in the present invention can be used in a wide assortment of articles of footwear including but not limited to those used for running, walking, basketball, tennis, volleyball, cross-training, baseball, football, golf, soccer, cycling, sandals, hiking boots, and army boots. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which can provide a wearer with improved cushioning and stability, running economy, and an extended service life while reducing the risks of injury normally associated with footwear degradation. The preferred article of footwear provides a wearer with the ability to customize the fit, but also the physical and mechanical properties and performance of the article of footwear. Moreover, the preferred article of footwear is economical and environmentally friendly to both manufacture and recycle.
The present invention also teaches articles of footwear including means for adjusting the provided foot shape, length, width, and girth. For example, spring elements, anterior outsole elements, stability elements, and uppers having different configurations, and also alternate positions for selectively affixing various portions of an upper can be used to adjust and customize the fit of an article of footwear for an individual wearer. The upper can also include elastic or elongation means for adjusting the width, girth, and foot shape. The components of the article of footwear possibly including but not limited to the upper, insole, cushioning means such as a spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired. Further, the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly, the article of footwear can be configured and customized for a wearer or a select target population in order to optimize performance criteria, as desired.
Moreover, the present invention teaches a method of making articles of footwear, and way of doing both retail and Internet business. For example, the anatomical features, configuration, and dimensions of a given wearer's foot and any other special needs, requirements, or preferences can be recorded by direct communication, observation, and measurement in a retail or medical setting, or alternately, by a wearer or other individual within their home or other remote site, and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to making a custom article of footwear. Conventional measuring or reproduction means such as rulers, measuring tapes, Brannock devices, two or three dimensional scanners, pressure sensors, infrared thermography, stereolithography, photographs, photocopies, FAX, e-mail, cameras, images, tracings, video, television, computers and computer screens, software, data storage and retrieval systems, templates, molds, models, and patterns can be used to help determine and make selections relating to an individual's foot shape, length, width, girth, and the like.

Given the provision of an adequate and ready stock of the various components anticipated for use in making the preferred articles of footwear, and the information and intelligence created from the data relating to an individual wearer or target population, a worker and/or automated system can assemble and make a customized article of footwear within five minutes. In fact, it is possible to assemble a custom article of footwear according to the present invention in less than one minute using a single fastener. This can be accomplished at the point of purchase or service center which can be located in a retail store, medical facility, or remote manufacturing environment. Accordingly, similar to the rapid delivery eyewear service centers and retail stores which presently exist, a customer can now also be provided with a custom article of footwear within minutes. Alternately, if and when an individual's data is received from a remote site at the Website or other address of a company which practices the present invention, and transmitted to a manufacturing or assembly center, a custom article of footwear can be made and possibly delivered to an individual's home or other designated address by same day or overnight service, as desired.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention teaches a method of making a custom article of footwear. The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element that can provide improved cushioning, stability, and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry, a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper, insole, heel counter, spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired.
A preferred article of footwear can include an anterior side, a posterior side, a medial side, a lateral side, a superior side, an inferior side, a longitudinal axis, a transverse axis, an upper, a sole, cushioning means such as a spring element comprising a superior spring element and an inferior spring element, and fastening means such as a mechanical fastener including male and female parts or self-adhesive means. The superior spring element can extend substantially between the posterior side and the anterior side of the article of footwear and be substantially positioned within the upper in order to secure the upper to the superior spring element. The inferior spring element and the sole can be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally with respect to the upper, and the superior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the inferior spring element by at least one fastener. The article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side in the forefoot area. Further, an anterior outsole element including a backing can be at least partially positioned within the upper. However, the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element including the ground engaging portion and a plurality of traction members can project through the openings in the upper, thus the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element can nevertheless be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally relative to the upper. In an alternate embodiment, the article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side, but also on a portion of the medial side, lateral side, and anterior side in the forefoot area, and the anterior outsole element can then include a backing having an elevated profile and traction members that extend upwards about a portion of the medial side, lateral side, and anterior side of the upper. In an alternate embodiment, the anterior portion of the outsole can be removably affixed to the external side of the upper with the use of other fastening means.
The article of footwear can possibly further include an insole, a stability element, a sole including an anterior outsole element, a middle outsole element, and a posterior outsole element having a backing, and also closure means such as an elastic upper, shoe laces, a strap including VELCROÂ® hook and pile, or a strap including openings and eyelets for receiving conventional shoe laces. A strap can encompass the medial side, lateral side, inferior side, and superior side of the upper. An alternate embodiment of a strap can also include a portion that encompasses the posterior side of the upper. In any case, a strap can be selectively removable and replaceable. In an alternate embodiment, the upper can be over-lasted, that is, over-sized in order to accommodate a removable and replaceable midsole cushioning element which can be inserted into the upper between the top portion of the insole and inferior side of upper.
The insole can include an elevated profile about the medial side, lateral side, anterior side, and posterior side for protecting a wearer's foot from contact with an elevated portion of an anterior outsole element, stability element, side support, or heel counter. The insole can include a heel pad, toe pad, bottom, and side portions having different thickness for selectively adjusting the effective length and width of the article of footwear. The inferior side of the upper can include an opening in the rearfoot area for positioning a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid-filled bladder or a resilient foam material. The superior side of an insole can then include a window in the rearfoot area for viewing a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid-filled bladder or a resilient foam material. A fluid-filled bladder can be positioned between a superior spring element, posterior spring element, or external heel counter and the inferior spring element.
The inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element and can project rearward and downward therefrom forming a V-shape. The superior spring element can further include an anterior spring element and a posterior spring element affixed together in functional relation, and the inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element. The anterior spring element and posterior spring element can be affixed together in an overlapping relationship. The anterior spring element can further include a projection, and the posterior spring element can include a recess for accommodating the anterior spring element. The superior spring element can have a configuration generally corresponding to the bottom net of the last of an article of footwear and can either be generally planar, or curved. At least a portion of the superior spring element can be curved to mate with the anatomy of a wearer. Further, a superior spring element can possibly also include a side stabilizer or a heel counter. The heel counter can be integral to the superior spring element, or alternately be a separate component. The upper can be trapped and secured in functional relation between an external heel counter and an overlaying superior spring element. An advantageous thickness for an external heel counter for a wearer having a given body weight can be approximately 2.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-140 pounds; 2.5 mm for a body weight in the range between 140-180 pounds, and 3.0 mm for a body weight in the range between 180-220 pounds.
An anterior spring element can have a curved shape and incorporate toe spring. The amount of toe spring incorporated in an anterior spring element can be in the range between 0-40 mm, and in particular, in the range between 10-30 mm. A substantial portion of the anterior spring element can extend anterior of 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper, whereas a substantial portion of the inferior spring element can extend within 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper.
The inferior spring element can include a longitudinal axis, a transverse axis, and a flexural axis. The flexural axis can be consistent with the transverse axis. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately, an inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration, and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Alternately, the inferior spring element can include a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 10-50 degrees. In particular, given an average individual wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker, it can be advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. Accordingly, the length of the effective lever arm on the medial side of the inferior spring element will be shorter than that on the lateral side, that is, as measured between the posterior side of the inferior spring element and the location of the flexural axis on each respective side. One way of expressing the length differential of the effective lever arms of the inferior spring element on the medial side versus the lateral side is with a ratio. In this regard, it can be advantageous for effecting rearfoot stability that the ratio of the length of the effective lever arms on the lateral side relative to those on the medial side be in the range between 1/1 to 2/1, and in particular, in the range between 1.25/1 to 2/1, and preferably in the range between 1.25/1 to 1.75/1.
Further, in a men's size 9 article of footwear, the posteriormost position of the flexural axis on the medial side can be in the range between 1-6 inches from the posterior side of the upper, and in particular, in the range between 2-4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately, an inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration, and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Whether the flexural axis be consistent with the transverse axis or be deviated therefrom, an inferior spring element having a symmetrical configuration on the medial side and lateral side can include an anterior portion extending between its anterior side and an anterior tangent point, a middle portion including an anterior curve extending between the anterior tangent point and a posterior tangent point, and a posterior portion extending between the posterior tangent point and the posterior side of said inferior spring element. It can be advantageous that the anterior curve be configured to have a fitted symmetrical radius of curvature. Moreover, the posterior portion of the inferior spring element can be inclined, or include a posterior curve.
The inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element, and can substantially maintain the maximum separation between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. Alternately, the inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element, and the separation can then be decreased between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be concave downwards near the anterior side of the inferior spring element, but can be concave upwards or convex near the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be made in a laminate configuration or structure. The inferior spring element can be made in a tapered configuration or structure. An inferior spring element can exhibit less stiffness in compression on the lateral side relative to the medial side, and it can be advantageous for walking and running activity that the differential stiffness be in the range between two-to-three to one.
The spring element can be made of a fiber composite material, and an unidirectional carbon fiber composite material including a toughened epoxy can be preferred for use. Alternately, the spring element can be made of a metal material such as spring steel or titanium. The spring element is preferably made of a material having spring characteristics such that the material is capable of storing and returning at least 70 percent of the mechanical energy imparted thereto. In this regard, a preferred fiber composite material, or alternately, a metal material such as spring steel or spring grade titanium is capable of storing and returning at least 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto when their mechanical characteristics are measured using test method ASTM 790.
The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element or forefoot area having a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. The superior spring element can also include a posterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 1-10 mm. When the superior spring element, or posterior spring element has a three dimensional shape in the rearfoot area including an integral heel counter or side counters, the superior spring element or posterior spring element can generally have a thickness in the range between 1-5 mm. Further, a spring element can include areas having different thickness, notches, slits, or openings which can serve to produce differential stiffness characteristics when the spring element is loaded. In this regard, the superior spring element or anterior spring element in the forefoot area can include at least one longitudinal notch or slit, and also a plurality of transverse notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side for influencing the flexural modulus and torsional characteristics in a desired manner. It can sometimes be advantageous for the transverse notches or slits on the lateral side to extend for a greater distance relative to those present on the medial side, and also for a pair of opposing notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side to approximately correspond the position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints, that is, be positioned between 60-70 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side. The spring element can include different types, orientations, configurations, and numbers of fiber composite layers in different areas in order to achieve differential stiffness when the spring element is loaded. Accordingly, the flexural modulus or stiffness exhibited by a spring element in the rearfoot area, midfoot area, forefoot area, and also that exhibited about any axis can be engineered, as desired. In this regard, it can be advantageous to create a region of reduced stiffness, that is, a forefoot strike zone, on the lateral side in the area approximately corresponding to the location of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints.
The inferior spring element can provide deflection in the range between 5-50 mm. For example, deflection approximately in the range between 8-15 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively fast pace, a racing flat, or a track spike. Alternately, deflection approximately in the rage between 15-50 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively slow pace. The inferior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 3-10 mm. The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include a forefoot area or anterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. Generally, regarding a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches, the width in the range between 75-85 mm, the vertical elevation is in the range between 10-18 mm, and the thickness is in the range between 4-5.5 mm at the anterior side 33 and in the range between approximately 2-3 mm at the posterior side. Generally, an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature for use in a men's size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches, an advantageous radius of curvature with respect to the superior side of the posterior curve is in the range between 7 and 11 inches, and an advantageous radius of curvature regarding the inferior side of the posterior portion is in the range between 4-6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running, given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown, it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees.
In particular, an inferior spring element for possible use with a men's size 9 article of footwear can have an overall length of 5.25 inches, and the anterior portion can measure 1.125 inches, the middle portion can measure 2.5 inches, and the posterior portion can measure 1.625 inches. Alternately, the overall length can be reduced by 0.25 inch by subtracting 0.125 inches from both the anterior portion and the posterior portion. Further, the inferior spring element can have a maximum width in the range between 75-80 mm, and the flexural axis can be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees. The anterior portion of the inferior spring element can also project downwards at a three degree angle towards the anterior side. This can facilitate attaining an advantageous geometry and fit with respect to a superior spring element and also an external heel counter. The fitted symmetrical radius of curvature of the anterior curve can have a radius of 2.606 inches, whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side of the posterior curve can be 9.0 inches, and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side of the posterior portion can be 5.138 inches. The vertical elevation of the inferior spring element can be 0.6299 inches or 16 mm, and the thickness of an inferior spring element for a wearer having a body weight of approximately 140-160 pounds can be 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side. If and when desired, the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10-18 mm, something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature associated with the anterior curve to also change, but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight, running technique, or characteristic running speeds, and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element having the dimensions recited in this paragraph, the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply: a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-120 pounds; 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120-140 pounds; 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140-160 pounds; 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160-180 pounds; 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180-200 pounds; and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200-220 pounds.
The article of footwear can further include a posterior spacer between the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element. Further, an anterior spacer can be used between a superior spring element and an anterior spring element, or alternately between an anterior spring element and an inferior anterior spring element. An anterior spacer or posterior spacer can also possibly be positioned between the anterior spring element and the posterior spring element. An anterior spacer and a posterior spacer can have a wedge or sloped shape. An anterior spacer can have a gently rounded shape near the posterior side. The shape of a posterior spacer and an anterior spacer can be used to modify the configuration and performance of a spring element and that of an associated article of footwear.
In an alternate embodiment of an article of footwear, the superior spring element can extend substantially between the posterior side and anterior side of the upper. Again the superior spring element can consist of a posterior spring element and an anterior spring element configured in an overlapping relationship. The inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element or posterior spring element, thus form a spring element having a v-shape in the rearfoot area. Further, an inferior anterior spring element can be positioned and affixed in function relation to an anterior spacer and the superior spring element or anterior spring element, thus forming a spring element having a v-shape in the forefoot area as well. The inferior anterior spring element can include at least one longitudinal notch or slit, and also at least one transverse notch or slit for influencing the flexural and torsional characteristics in a desired manner.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element which can provide improved cushioning, stability, and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry, a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper, insole, spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired. The present invention also teaches an article of footwear including means for adjusting the length, width, girth and foot shape. Further, the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly, the article of footwear can be customized by a wearer or specially configured for a select target population in order to optimize desired performance criteria. Moreover, the present invention teaches a novel method of manufacturing an article of footwear, and also, a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business.
 FIG. 1 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a spring element 51 consisting of at least two portions, a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. The portions of spring element 51 can be integrally formed in a single component, but can alternately be formed in at least two parts which can be affixed together by adhesives. Preferably, the superior spring element 47 is capable of being removably affixed in functional relation to the inferior spring element 50, upper 23, and sole 32 with the use of fastening means such as mechanical engagement means including at least one mechanical fastener 29.
A mechanical fastener 29 can be made, e.g., of metal, ceramic, composite, thermoplastic, or thermoset materials. Threaded nuts and bolts, rivets, pop-rivets, push-rivets, snap rivets, snaps, hooks, clips, mating male and female structures, quarter turn fasteners, bayonet style fasteners, quick-release fasteners, and the like, can be used as a fastener. Preferred metals for use in a fastener can include aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, zinc coated steel, and other metals or treatments that are resistant to substantial degradation caused normal oxidation and corrosion. Thermoplastic snap-rivets 151 and push rivets 152 made and distributed by Richco, Inc. of Chicago, Ill. are shown in FIGS. 481-482. A large variety of fasteners are made, e.g., by Penn Engineering & Manufacturing Corporation of Danboro, Pa., Avibank Manufacturing, Inc. of Burbank, Calif., Atlas Engineering of Kent, Ohio, Stayfast Products, Inc. of Fort Mill, S.C., DFS International Inc. of Orlando, Fla., and Fairchild, Inc. of Simi Valley, Calif. Shown in FIG. 483 is a standard full hex blind threaded insert 153 made by Atlas Engineering, Inc., and similar configurations are also available from Stayfast Products, Inc. Armand Savoie of MacNeill Engineering of Marlborough, Mass. is the inventor of so-called âQ-lockâ fasteners taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,151,805, and 6,332,281, and these patents are hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Fasteners having a threaded portion which further include a portion that can be collapsed or crimped in order to grip a portion of a structure into which they are being fitted are known in the prior art. When a thermoplastic material is used, a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure, welding, adhesive, polymerization, and then later be removed by destructive method or again with the use of heat and pressure. For example, the distal end of a male portion of a fastener can be melted and formed into a rivet like shape with the use of heat and pressure. When a thermoset material is used, a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure, polymerization, vulcanization, and later be removed with the use of heat and pressure, or destructive method. Contact adhesives and light cure adhesives can also be used to create or affix a fastener.
Preferably, a selectively removable and replaceable mechanical fastener 29 can be used, thus enabling some or all of the components of a spring element 51 and an article of footwear 22 to be removed and replaced, as desired. A fastener can include Allen head or star drive mechanical mating configurations for use with a like installation and removal tool. If desired, a fastener can also be torque limited so as to tighten to an appropriate and desired maximum torque value. So-called âsmart boltsâ developed for NASA which are known by the tradename INTELLIGENT FASTENERÂ® and made by Ultrafast, Inc. of Malvern, Pa. can be used. Fasteners known in the prior art having a male portion including threads that are coated with a thermoplastic or other locking material, or alternately, a fastener having a female portion including a thermoplastic or other locking material, can also be used in order to prevent loosening during use. Moreover, fasteners including mating male and female parts which can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so-called quarter turn, bayonet, or quick-release structures and methods can be advantageous for use. In this regard, the thickness of a superior spring element 47, inferior spring element 50, and upper 23 can be known, thus standardized or graded for various sizes of an article of footwear. Accordingly, it is possible to design and engineer fasteners 29 including mating male and female parts that can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so-called quarter turn, bayonet, or quick-release structures and methods. Moreover, alternate inferior spring elements 50 having different thickness within an engineered and preferred selected range can be accommodated and used, as desired.
Again, it can be readily understood that other conventional means can be used to affix the upper 23 in functional relation to the spring element 51 and outsole 43, such as VELCROÂ® hook and pile, or other mechanical engagement means and devices. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a portion of the posterior outsole element 46 can slip over and trap a portion of the inferior spring element 50 and then be secured with fasteners 29. Further, at least one hook 27 can extend from the backing 30 of anterior outsole element 44 and engage a portion of the upper 23 or the superior spring element 47 as a portion of the outsole 43 is attached to a preferred article of footwear 22.
Again, published examples of devices and means for selectively and removably affixing various components of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,183,277, 2,200,080, 2,220,534, 2,552,943, 2,588,061, 2,640,283, 2,873,540, 3,012,340, 3,818,617, 3,878,626, 3,906,646, 3,982,336, 4,103,440, 4,107,857, 4,132,016, 4,262,434, 4,267,650, 4,279,083, 4,300,294, 4,317,294, 4,351,120, 4,377,042, 4,535,554, 4,606,139, 4,807,372, 4,887,369, 5,042,175, 5,083,385, 5,317,822, 5,339,544, 5,410,821, 5,533,280, 5,542,198, 5,615,497, 5,628,129, 5,644,857, 5,657,558, 5,661,915, 5,678,327, 5,692,319, 5,729,916, 5,826,352, 5,896,608, 6,151,805, 6,247,249 B1, 6,282,814 B1, 6,324,772 B1, 6,332,281 B1, 6,349,486 B1, and application WO 02/13641 A1, all of these patents and patent applications hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
Also shown in FIG. 1 is an upper 23 including a heel counter 24, tip 25, vamp 52, anterior side 33, posterior side 34, medial side 35, top or superior side 37, bottom or inferior side 38, forefoot area 58, midfoot area 67, rearfoot area 68, midsole 26, a spring element 51 including an inferior spring element 50, an outsole 43 including an anterior outsole element 44 and posterior outsole element 46 having a tread or ground engaging surface 53, and the presence of toe spring 62. The upper 23 can be made of a plurality of conventional materials known in the footwear art such as leather, natural or synthetic textile materials, paper or cardboard, stitching, adhesive, thermoplastic material, foam material, and natural or synthetic rubber. Since the various components of a preferred article of footwear 22 can be easily removed and replaced, a wearer can select a custom upper 23 having a desired size, shape, design, construction and functional capability. The article of footwear 22 can also include means for customizing the shape, width, and fit of the upper 23 such as taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,729,912, 5,813,146, 6,442,874, B1, WO 99/24498 A2, and the like, the recited patents and patent application hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Further, the present invention teaches novel devices and methods for customizing the width, girth, and last or foot shape of the preferred article of footwear, as discussed in greater detail below. Moreover, the article of footwear 22 can include a custom insole 31 using light cure material as taught in the applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,057, and also U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,502 entitled âMethod of Making Custom Insoles and Point of Purchase Display, both of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
The upper 23 can be made with the use conventional patterns, materials, and means known in the prior art. Accordingly an upper 23 can include a natural or synthetic textile material 137 such as a woven or knit fabric, and the like. It can be readily understood that the textile material 137 can consist of a three dimensional textile material, a multi-layer textile material, water resistant or waterproof materials, shape memory textile materials, or stretchable and elastic textile materials, and the like. The textile material 137 included in the upper 23 can also be formed by three dimensional or circular knitting methods known in the prior art such as in the manufacture of socks, and a suitable pattern for use can be derived or cut therefrom.
Alternately, the textile material 137 forming at least a portion of the upper 23 can be made in the origami-like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,997 granted to Dieter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,918 granted to Smets, U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,679 B1 granted to Chenevert, patent applications WO 02/13641 A1 by Long and WO 02/23641 A1 by Kilgore et al., and the like, all of these patents and patent applications being assigned to Nike, Inc. Further, the upper 23 can be made in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,251 granted to Litchfield et al., and also those of U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., and the like, both of these patents being assigned to Reebok International, Ltd. In addition, generally similar to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,712 granted to Iglesias et al., the upper 23 can include a textile material that is overmolded with a thermoplastic material. All of the patents and patent applications recited in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference herein.
As shown in FIG. 349, the textile material 137 can be impregnated or overmolded with a plastic material 138 forming a stability element 136 d, e.g., a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, or polyethylene, or alternatively, an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems that are recited elsewhere herein, a foam thermoplastic material, a rubber material, or a polyurethane material. The textile material 137 can be impregnated or overmolded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., or alternately, while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last 80, mold, or the like. For example, stability element 136 d shown in FIG. 349 can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper 23.
Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper 23 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al., and also U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., and the like, both patents being assigned to Nike, Inc., these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material 137 can possibly be impregnated or overmolded with the use of a spray, dipping, or roller application generally similar to that known in the screenprinting prior art. If the plastic material 138 is of the thermoplastic variety, it can then be caused to cool and take a set.
Alternately, a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or overmold the textile material 137 can be caused to cross-link by conventional means known in the prior art. As taught in the applicant's U.S. Ser. No. 09/570,171, filed May 11, 2000, light-cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 includes a plurality of openings 72 for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members 115 associated with the anterior outsole element 44 therethrough, it can be advantageous that the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 in the forefoot area 58, and possibly also that the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68 be impregnated or overmolded by plastic material 138, or other suitable material. Alternately, the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 can be otherwise reinforced in order to enhance its structural integrity.
As shown in FIG. 350, the upper 23 can be made in general accordance with the so-called Huarache style commercialized by Nike, Inc. The textile material 137 can have resilient and elastic qualities, or alternatively, a rubber, neoprene foam rubber, polyurethane, or other material can be used in those areas of the vamp 52 and quarters 119 in which the location of a textile material 137 is indicated. In this regard, the textile material 137, or alternately, a substitute material having substantial elastic characteristics can extend into the collar area 122 in order to create a so-called fit sleeve and facilitate entry and exit of a wearer's foot. Accordingly, the upper 23 can in some footwear embodiments solely constitute the required and sufficient closure means for retaining a wearer's foot therein. Further, the upper 23 can include removable quarters including openings 72 and eyestays 139 for accommodating laces 121, straps 118, or other conventional closure means.
The upper 23 can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example, textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the tradename NATUREWORKSÂ® fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis, Minn. in cooperation with the Kanebo Corporation which is associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka, Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials, but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear, those derived from polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil over a period of two to three years. Moreover, other biodegradable and environmentally-friendly plastic materials and fibers can also be suitable for use.
As shown in FIG. 4, the anterior outsole element 44 and posterior outsole element 46 can include a backing 30 portion. The outsole 43 can be firmly secured in function relation to the upper 23 and spring element 51 with the use of at least one fastener 29. In an alternate embodiment, it is possible to configure the posterior outsole portion 46 such that a portion can slip over and trap the posterior side of the inferior spring element 50, and the posterior outsole element 46 can then be secured with at least one fastener 29 near the anterior side of the posterior outsole element 46 and inferior spring element 50. Since the posterior outsole element 46 consists of a resilient elastomer such as natural or synthetic rubber, during footstrike and the early portion of the braking phase of the gait cycle, the posterior outsole element 46 can become somewhat elongated and distended along the longitudinal or anterior to posterior axis and to lesser degree the medial to lateral or transverse axis, and this can further contribute to reducing the shock and vibration generated upon impact, as the forces and direction of loading during footstrike and the braking phase have not only vertical or z axis, but also x and y axis components.
The ground engaging portion 53 of the outsole 43 can be made of a natural or synthetic rubber material such as nitrile or styrene butadiene rubber, a thermoplastic material, an elastomer such as polyurethane, a hybrid thermoplastic rubber, and the like. Further, these materials can possibly be suitable for use when blown or foamed. Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations include dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems, 338 Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44311, e.g., SANTOPRENEÂ®, VYRAMÂ®, GEOLASTÂ®, TREFSINÂ®, VISTAFLEXÂ®, GEOLASTÂ®, DYTROL XLÂ®, and taught in the following patents, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,783,631, 5,779,968, 5,777,033, 5,777,029, 5,750,625, 5,672,660, 5,609,962, 5,591,798, 5,589,544, 5,574,105, 5,523,350, 5,403,892, 5,397,839, 5,397,832, 5,349,005, 5,300,573, 5,290,886, 5,177,147, 5,157,081, 5,100,947, 5,086,121, 5,081,179, 5,073,597, 5,070,111, 5,051,478, 5,051,477, 5,028,662, and U.S. Pat. No. RE 035398. SANTOPRENEÂ® is known to consist of a combination of butyl rubber and ethylene-propylene. KRATONÂ® thermoplastic elastomers made by the Shell Oil Corporation, DYNAFLEXÂ® thermoplastic elastomers, and VERSAFLEXÂ® thermoplastic elastomer alloys distributed by GLS Corporation of McHenry, Ill. can also be suitable for use. Further, the material compositions taught in both U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,342,544 B1 and 6,367,167 granted to Krstic et al. and assigned to Nike, Inc. can also be suitable for use, and these patents are hereby incorporated by reference herein.
The backing 30 portion of the outsole 43 can be made of a formulation of a thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyurethane, or SANTOPRENEÂ® that is relatively firm relative to the ground engaging portion 53 of the outsole 43. For example, a polyurethane or SANTOPRENEÂ® material having a hardness between 35-75 Durometer Asker C could be used on the ground engaging portion 53 of the outsole 43, whereas a polyurethane or SANTOPRENEÂ® material having a hardness between 75-100 Durometer on the Shore A or D scales could be used to make the backing 30 of outsole 43. A polyurethane backing 30 can be bonded to a polyurethane ground engaging portion 53 of outsole 43 or other material, or alternately, a SANTOPRENEÂ® backing can be bonded to a SANTOPRENEÂ® ground engaging portion 53 of outsole 43. This can be accomplished by dual injection molding, or over-molding of the like materials.
One advantage when using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole 43 concerns the affinity of like materials for effectively bonding together. Another advantage in using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole 43 concerns the âgreenâ or environmentally friendly and recyclable nature of the component at the end of its service life. It is possible for the spent homogenous outsole 43 component including the backing 30 and ground engaging portion 53 to be recycled by the footwear manufacturer or by a third party, e.g., the outsole 43 can be re-ground into pieces and be thermoformed to make a portion of a new outsole 43 component. Further, the relative absence of adhesives in the manufacture of the outsole components and article of footwear taught in the present invention also makes for a âgreenâ or environmentally friendly product. In contrast, conventional articles of footwear are commonly manufactured with the extensive use of adhesives for bonding a foam midsole to an upper and outsole. These adhesives are commonly non-environmentally friendly and can pose health hazards, and the resulting article of footwear cannot be so easily disassembled or recycled at the end of its service life. Moreover, the process associated with making conventional foam materials in making a midsole, and the blowing agents used therein, can be non-environmentally friendly and relatively energy inefficient as compared with conventional injection molding of thermoplastic materials, or the use of light cure materials and methods, as taught in the applicant's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/862,598 entitled âMethod of Making a Light Cure Component For Articles of Footwear,â hereby incorporated by reference herein. For example, instead of using large presses imparting both heat and pressure upon compression molds for effecting the cure of a midsole or outsole component over perhaps a seven minute cycle time, injection molding equipment and light cure technology can be used to reduce the cycle times to perhaps fractions of a second with relative energy efficiency and little or no waste product in a relatively environmentally friendly manufacturing environment. Accordingly, manufacturing can be located in the United States, or otherwise closer to the intended market.
It is also possible for heterogeneous materials to be used in making the backing 30 and ground engaging portion 53 of the outsole 43. For example, Advanced Elastomer Systems has developed a formulation of SANTOPRENEÂ® which is capable of bonding to nylon. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,709,954, 5,786,057, 5,843,268, and 5,906,872 granted to Lyden et al. and assigned to Nike, Inc. which relate to chemical bonding of rubber to plastic materials in articles of footwear, all of these patents hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the backing 30 can simultaneously comprise at least a portion of the spring element 51 of the article of footwear 22, as shown in FIG. 16. In addition, the outsole 43 can also include desired lines of flexion 54. The following patents and some of the prior art recited therein contain teachings with respect to lines of flexion 54 in articles of footwear such as grooves, and the like: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,384,973, 5,425,184, 5,625,964, 5,709,954, 5,786,057, 4,562,651, 4,837,949, and 5,024,007, all of these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein.
The use of a relatively soft elastomeric material having good dampening characteristics on the ground engaging portion 53 of an outsole 43 can contribute to enhanced attenuation of the shock and vibration generated by impact events. Relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics tend to have inferior abrasion and wear characteristics, and this can pose a practical limitation on their use in conventional articles of footwear constructed with the use of adhesives having non-renewable outsoles. However, the use of relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics does not pose a practical problem with respect to the preferred article of footwear 22 taught in the present application since the outsole 43 can be easily renewed and replaced. Accordingly, the preferred article of footwear 22 can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning effects relative to many conventional articles of footwear.
The spring element 51 can be made of a resilient material such as metal, and in particular, spring steel or titanium. Titanium is widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries in part due to its excellent strength to weight ratio and durability. Titanium materials are available in three general categories depending upon their alloy content: alpha, that is, a material having a close packed hexagonal atomic arrangement, alpha/beta, and beta, that is, a material having a body centered cubic atomic arrangement, The preferred titanium alloys for use in a spring element 51 are those which can be characterized either as alpha/beta, or beta. Examples of suitable alpha/beta, or beta titanium alloys include â15-3â and â6-4â which can be obtained from TIMETÂ®, Titanium Metals Corporation, of 403 Ryder Avenue, Vallejo, Calif. 94590, and also from President Titanium of Hanson, Mass. 02341.
The spring element 51 can alternately be made of a thermoplastic material, or alternately, a preferred fiber composite material. Glass fiber, aramid or KEVLARÂ® fiber, boron fiber, or carbon fiber composite materials can be used individually, or in partial or complete combination. Glass fiber composite materials are generally available at a cost of about $5.00 per pound, whereas carbon fiber materials are generally available at a cost of about $8.00-$14.00 per pound. Glass fiber composite materials generally exhibit a lower modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus, thus less stiffness in bending as compared with carbon fiber materials, but can generally withstand more severe bending without breaking. However, the higher modulus of elasticity of carbon fiber composite materials can provide greater stiffness in bending, a higher spring rate, and reduced weight relative to glass fiber composite materials exhibiting like flexural modulus. Blends or combinations of glass fiber and carbon fiber materials are commonly known as hybrid composite materials.
Carbon fiber composite materials can be impregnated or coated with thermoplastic materials or thermoset materials. The modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus of some finished thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials can be lower than that of some thermoset carbon fiber composite materials. For example, a sample of thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material having a relatively broad weave can have a flexural modulus in the range between 10-12 Msi, and in the range between 5-6 Msi in a finished part, whereas a âstandard modulusâ grade of thermoset impregnated uni-directional carbon fiber composite material can have a flexural modulus in the range of 33 Msi, and in the range between 18-20 Msi in a finished part. Also available are âintermediate modulusâ carbon fiber composite materials at approximately 40 Msi, and âhigh modulusâ carbon fiber composite materials having a flexural modulus greater than 50 Msi and possibly as high as approximately 100 Msi. Accordingly, in order the achieve a desired flexural modulus or stiffness value, a thicker and heavier part made of a thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material can be required, that is, relative to a thermoset impregnated uni-directional carbon fiber composite material.
Impregnated carbon fiber composite materials are commonly known as âprepregâ materials. Such materials are available in roll and sheet form and in various grades, sizes, types of fibers, and fiber configurations, but also with various resin components. Various known fiber configurations include so-called woven, plain, basket, twill, satin, uni-directional, multi-directional, and hybrids. Prepreg carbon fiber composite materials are available having various flexural modulus, and generally, the higher is the modulus then the more expensive is the material. A standard modulus uni-directional prepreg peel-ply toughened carbon fiber composite material such as C2000, 33550, 150 GSM, having a 35 percent resin content, or alternately, âquick-cureâ 2510 made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. 97121 can be suitable for use. This prepreg material can have a thickness of 0.025 mm or 0.01 inches including the peel-ply backing and in the range between 0.13-0.15 mm or 0.005 inches without. It is therefore relatively easy to predict the number of layers required in order to made a part having a known target thickness, but one should also allow for a nearly 10 percent reduction in thickness of the part due to shrinkage during the curing process. The cost in bulk of a suitable unidirectional 33 Msi thermoset standard modulus carbon fiber composite material having a weight of approximately 150-300 grams per square meter made and distributed by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. is presently approximately in the range between $8.00 and $9.00 per pound, and one pound yields approximately one square meter of material.
The required thickness of a spring element 51 and any possible sub-components can vary considerably depending upon, e.g., the materials being used, the construction and processing methods being used, the overall design and configuration of a particular part, the fastener(s) possibly being used, the intended activity or particular application, and also the weight, biomechanical technique, and characteristic running speed or velocity of an individual wearer. Nevertheless, the following information can serve as a broad guideline both when making and selecting a spring element 51 and any possible sub-components for use in an article of footwear. The superior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element having a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. It can be advantageous that the anterior spring element 48 maintain a thickness that is not much less than 1 mm in order to well distribute point loads, enhance robustness of the part, and to provide a noticeable performance enhancement. The superior spring element or posterior spring element can have a thickness in the rearfoot area approximately in the range between 1-10 mm, but when formed in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter, can have a lesser thickness in the range between 1-5 mm. The inferior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 3-10 mm.
The following more specific guidelines relate to an article of footwear including a spring element having relatively short lever arms which can provide approximately 10 mm of deflection generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing FIGS. 1-4. The required thickness of the superior spring element 47 or anterior spring element 48 in the forefoot area 58 of an article of footwear intended for use in running when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is then normally approximately in the range between 1.0-1.25 mm for an individual weighing 100-140 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds, approximately in the range between 1.25-1.50 mm for an individual weighing 140-180 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds, and in the range between 1.5-1.75 mm for an individual weighing 180-220 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds. When running at higher speeds, e.g., on a track and field surface, individuals generally prefer a thicker and stiffer plate relative to that selected for use at slow or moderate speeds. The perceived improvement in running economy can be on the order of at least one second over four hundred meters which corresponds to approximately two to three percent improvement in aerobic ability. The superior spring element 47 or anterior spring element 48 can store energy when loaded during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle, and then release that energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase. A spring element can provide not only deflection for attenuating shock and vibration associated with impact events, but can also provide a relatively high level of mechanical efficiency by possibly storing and returning in excess of 70 percent of the energy imparted thereto. Accordingly, the spring to dampening ratio of the material of which the spring element is made can be expressed as being equal to or greater than 70/30 percent. In fact, a preferred unidirectional carbon fiber composite material or spring titanium material can return in excess of 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto during the materials test associated with test method ASTM 790. In contrast, most conventional prior art athletic footwear soles including foam midsoles and rubber outsoles have a spring to dampening ratio somewhere between 40 and 60 percent. The preferred article of footwear 22 can then afford a wearer with greater mechanical efficiency and running economy than most conventional prior art athletic footwear.
Further, unlike the conventional foam materials used in prior art articles of footwear such as ethylene vinyl acetate which can become compacted and take a compression set, the spring elements 51 used in the present invention are not substantially subject to compression set degradation due to repetitive loading. The degradation of conventional foam materials can cause injury to a wearer, as when a broken down midsole results in a wearer's foot being unnaturally placed in a supinated or pronated position as opposed to a more neutral position, or when a compacted foam midsole in the forefoot area 58 causes a wearer's metatarsals to drop out of normal orientation or to unnaturally converge. Further, the quality of cushioning provided by conventional foam materials such as ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane rapidly degrades as the material becomes compacted and takes a compression set. In contrast, the spring elements 51 taught in the present invention do not substantially suffer from these forms of degradation, rather provide substantially the same performance and geometric integrity after extended use as when new. Given an article of footwear including removable and replaceable components, in the event of a fatigue or catastrophic failure of a spring element, the damaged part can simply be removed and replaced.
Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing FIGS. 1-4, the required thickness of a superior spring element 47, or posterior spring element 49 for the rearfoot area 68 of an article of footwear intended for running use when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is approximately in the range between 2.0-5.0 mm, and in particular, is approximately in the range between 2.75-3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100-140 pounds, approximately in the range between 3.25-3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140-180 pounds, and approximately in the range between 3.75-4.25 for an individual weighing between 180-220 pounds. It can be advantageous for the sake of robustness that the thickness of the inferior spring element 50 be at least equal to or greater than that of the corresponding superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 in the rearfoot area 68, as the inferior spring element 50 has a more complex curved shape and is subject to direct repetitive impact events. Accordingly, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing FIGS. 1-4, the required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber material is approximately in the range between 2.0-5.0 mm, and in particular, is approximately in the range between 2.75-3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100-140 pounds, approximately in the range between 3.25-3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140-180 pounds, and approximately in the range between 3.75-4.25 for an individual weighing between 180-220 pounds.
Different individuals can have different preferences with respect to the thickness and stiffness of various spring element components regardless of their body weight, and this can be due to their having different running styles or different habitual average running speeds. During normal walking activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between one to two body weights, whereas during normal running activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between two to three body weights. Accordingly, the flexural modulus of a spring element for use in an article of footwear primarily intended for walking can be reduced relative to an article of footwear intended for running, thus the thickness and/or stiffness of the spring element can be reduced. During a lateral movement and jumping sport such as basketball, the loads generated can be much higher and in the range between 2.5 and 10 body weights. Accordingly, greater stiffness and/or thickness can be required of a spring element 51 and any sub-component parts. As result it can sometimes be advantageous to introduce an additional cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a fluid-filled bladder and/or a foam material between a superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and an inferior spring element 50, and also between a superior spring element 47 or anterior spring element 48.1, and an anterior spring element 48.2.
When making spring elements using carbon fiber composite material, it is important to recognize that relatively slight variations in the configuration or design can have both substantial and subtle effects upon the exhibited stiffness, service life, and overall performance of the component. For example, consider the long bow, versus the recurve bow configuration used in archery. These two shapes provide different stiffness characteristics when the bow is being drawn, and also when the arrow is released. For example, when the inferior spring element 50 is made in a sharper curved shape it can exhibit greater stiffness and a different stress/strain curve, that is, relative to when it is made in a more gentle curved configuration.
Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing FIGS. 1-4, the following constitutes an approximate guideline regarding the required thickness and stiffness of a superior spring element 47 or anterior spring element 48 made of standard modulus 33 Msi unidirectional carbon fiber composite material for use in the forefoot area 48 of a running shoe given a wearer's body weight and common perception. Again, much depends on an individual's body weight, running technique, speed, and the intended application. For example, an individual having a given body weight who happened to be a heavy heel striker would likely select an anterior spring element 48 having the next highest stiffness value. Likewise, an individual who habitually runs at a faster pace than another individual having a similar body weight and running technique might also select an anterior spring element 48 having the next highest stiffness value. Nevertheless, Table 1 shown below can provide guidance to runners making selections regarding a suitable spring element 51.

Again, regarding the rearfoot area 68 of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, the thickness of the part can vary considerably depending upon whether a relatively flat configuration, or alternately, a cupped shape anatomical configuration which possibly includes a curved midfoot area 67 including longitudinal and transverse arch support, medial and lateral side stabilizers, or a heel counter 24 is incorporated therein. Given a three dimensional cupped or anatomical shaped posterior spring element 49 including a heel counter, and an individual weighing between 100-200 pounds the minimum thickness required to achieve the desired robustness is believed to be approximately in the range between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. However, when a fastener 29 is used to affix the inferior spring element 50 to the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, even with the presence of a large washer or flange, a fastener 29 can still impart a relatively large point load, thus a minimum thickness of 2.5 mm in the area near the position of the fastener 29 can be required in order to ensure robustness.
Regardless, the upwardly extending portions of a posterior spring element 49 forming a heel counter 24 and also the anterior edge of the part can generally be made to have a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.0 mm. It is believed to be advantageous for the purposes of commercialization to over-engineer the part with respect to load tolerance and robustness and to make the inferior side of the posterior portion of a superior spring element 47 or a posterior spring element 49, in not more than three or four different thickness: e.g., approximately 2.0 mm for the range between 100-140 pounds body weight; approximately 2.5 mm for the range between 140-180 pounds body weight; and, approximately 3.0 mm for the range between 180-220 pounds body weight.
It can be helpful to provide guidance regarding the stiffness characteristics associated with various portions of a spring element 51, e.g., S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard), VH (very hard) UH (ultra hard), or to otherwise identify suitable performance criteria by specific event, player position, and the like. One way of expressing the relationship between superior spring elements 47 or posterior spring elements 49 having a three dimension cupped shape including a heel counter which are made in one of three different thickness in the rearfoot area 68, and the possible use of five different alternate thickness in the forefoot area 58 of the superior spring element 47 or an anterior spring element 48 in a running shoe suitable for use in track and field is shown in Table 2 below.

Regarding the amount of deflection in the rearfoot area 68 associated with the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, if and when the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 is made in a three dimensional cupped shape possibly including a heel counter 24, then not much deflection will take place, e.g., normally something in the range between 0-2.0 mm. It is important to recognize that if the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 is made in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter that only permits something in the range between 0-2.0 mm of deflection, then this can place a larger load and requirement for deflection upon the inferior spring element 50. Accordingly, all things being equal, the inferior spring element 50 could then have to be made thicker and/or stiffer. Nevertheless, if and when the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 is substantially flat and planar, and the inferior spring element 50 is curved, but both parts have about the same thickness, then the inferior spring element 50 will generally still exhibit the most deflection. However, the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 will also account for a portion of the total deflection. In the abstract, if the parts are engineered so as to permit 10 mm of total deflection, then the inferior spring will normally account for at least half, and perhaps nearer to three quarters of the deflection, before the two parts would meet and âbottom outâ the mechanical system. Here, a great deal depends upon the design and manufacture of the parts, the application, and the wearer's body weight and technique.
Given a running shoe used in a typical linear running motion, even 4-6 mm of deflection of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 in the rearfoot area 68 will not pose a biomechanical or stability problem provided that the article of footwear is designed properly. It should be noted that the fat pad on the human heel is known to commonly deflect approximately in the range between 8-10 mm, and also the longitudinal arches of many individuals are known to commonly deflect in the range between 2-6 mm. Moreover, in existing conventional articles of footwear including foam midsoles equal to or greater than 4-6 mm of deflection commonly takes place on both the top and bottom sides of the sole during a rearfoot impact event.
A question can be raised concerning the possibility of 4-6 mm of deflection taking place at the lateral rear corner, that is, deflection having a torsional component. If a line 80 mm in length is drawn representing the width of the bottom net of the outsole 43 of a typical running shoe sole in the rearfoot area 68, and then a line 6 mm high is drawn perpendicular to and intersecting the line having a length of 80 mm at the end on the lateral side, the resulting angle as measured from the opposite side of the line having a length of 80 mm is only approximately five degrees. This does not degrade stability since the feet of most individuals are normally supinated approximately 7-8 degrees upon footstrike when running barefoot on grass, and substantial rotative movements commonly take place between the rearfoot and forefoot areas of an individual's foot during running activity. Further, the average runner commonly pronates approximately 7-8 degrees when running barefoot on grass, but double that magnitude of pronation can be associated with running in conventional prior art articles of footwear including foam midsoles. However, both the rate and magnitude of pronation can often be reduced by using an article of footwear made according to the present invention, that is, relative to a conventional prior art article of footwear. Moreover, it can possibly be advantageous to engineer an article of footwear including a spring element 51 intended for running so as to approximate the magnitude of supination upon footstrike, and also the subsequent magnitude and rate of pronation commonly observed when individuals run barefoot on natural grass. Nevertheless, it can be readily understood that the design and engineering of an article of footwear including a spring element 51 can have different requirements for other sport applications which include lateral and random movements.
Again, the required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 will depend in part upon whether the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 is contributing to deflection, and by how much, the design and composition of the inferior spring element 50, but also a wearer's body weight, biomechanical technique, and speed. For example, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in FIGS. 1-4 which provides approximately 10 mm of total deflection, and a generally planar superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 making a contribution to deflection of less than or equal to 5 mm, and an individual running at slow to moderate speeds, the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element 50 made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material having a curved configuration and a diagonal flexural axis 59 is shown in Table 3 provided below.
If and when the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 has a three dimensional shape including a heel counter and therefore makes little or no contribution to deflection, that is, deflection in the range between 0-2.0 mm, then the inferior spring element 50 will generally need to be approximately at least 0.25-0.5 mm thicker in order to effectively manage the loading associated with greater deflection so as to not exceed approximately 60-66 percent of the inferior spring element's 50 maximum engineered loading capacity. This percentage represents an approximate threshold regarding the capability of carbon fiber composite materials to withstand cycling loading for hundreds of thousands or millions of cycles.
It is important to note that as the flexural axis 59 is rotated from the transverse axis 91 orientated at 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis 69 and towards a 45 degree angle, the effective length of the flexural axis 59 and stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 can be increased. Further, when the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50 are being fabricated, it can be advantageous to position some of the layers of the carbon fiber material both consistent with and perpendicular to the orientation of the flexural axis 59, since this area can function as a fulcrum point and be associated with high local loading.
The length of the effective lever arms 60 and 61 of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, and the inferior spring element 50 on the medial and lateral sides will also influence the stiffness of the larger spring element 51. Accordingly, it can be readily understood that scalar effects can be present with respect to widely varying sizes of articles of footwear. Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in FIGS. 1-4 providing approximately 10 mm of deflection and made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material, the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element 50 as a function of the body weight of a runner, and also the type of superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 being used is shown in Table 3 below.

When the superior spring element 47 consists of a single part, the thickness can vary and be tapered from the posterior side 34 to the anterior side 33, that is, the part can gradually become thinner moving in the direction of the anterior side 33. This can be accomplished by reducing the number of layers during the building of the part and/or with the use of compressive force during the molding or curing process. When the superior spring element 47 consists of two parts, e.g., an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49, the parts can be made in different thickness. Alternately, the posterior spring element 49 can be made of a higher modulus material having a given thickness, and the anterior spring element 48 can be made of a lower modulus material having the same thickness, thus the two parts can possibly have the same thickness but nevertheless provide different and desired spring and dampening characteristics.
Alternately, the number of fiber composite layers, the type of fiber and resin composition of the layers, the inclusion of a core material, and the geometry and orientation of the layers, can be varied so as to create areas of differential stiffness in a spring element 51. For example, the inferior spring element 50 can project from the superior spring element 47 with the flexural axis 59 orientated consistent with a transverse axis, that is, at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 provided that the aforementioned variables concerning the fiber composite layers are suitably engineered so as to render the medial side 35 of the inferior spring element 50 approximately 2-3 times stiffer than the lateral side 36, that is, in an article of footwear intended for walking or running activity.
Further, the configuration of a spring element 51, and in particular, an inferior spring element 50 having an flexural axis 59 orientated at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis 69, can be configured so as to provide differential stiffness. For example, a portion of a spring element 51 can include transverse or longitudinal slits, notches, openings, a core material, or reduced thickness so as to exhibit areas of differential stiffness, as shown in FIG. 10. Several configurations and methods for achieving differential stiffness in the midfoot area 67 or rearfoot area 68 of an article of footwear are recited in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,567, this patent being hereby incorporated by reference herein. However, the relatively sharp portion of the spring element that is shown projecting beyond the medial side of the sole in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,567 could possibly result in injury to the medial side of a wearer's opposite leg during running. Further, given the common orientation of the foot of a wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker during footstrike, an inferior spring element 50 having an flexural axis 59 orientated consistent with transverse axis 91, that is, at 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis 69, is generally not so advantageously disposed to receive repetitive loading and exhibit robustness during its service life relative to an inferior spring element 50 having an flexural axis 59 deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10 and 50 degrees, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. In this regard, the foot of a wearer characterized as a rearfoot striker is normally somewhat dorsiflexed, supinated and abducted during footstrike, as recited and shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,425,184, and 5,625,964, these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly, given an average individual having normal biomechanics who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker, it can be advantageous for the flexural axis 59 of the inferior spring element 50 to be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 20-30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. However, the flexural axis 59 of an inferior spring element 50 can be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 30-50 degrees in footwear intended for use by individuals who tend to more substantially pronate during the braking and stance phases of the gait cycle. Other teachings having possible merit relating to differential stiffness in the rearfoot area of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,506,462, 4,364,189, 5,201,125, 5,197,206, and 5,197,207, all of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
In order to make carbon fiber composite spring elements, it can be advantageous to create a form or mold. The form or mold can be made of wood, composite material, metal, and the like. For example, prototype forms or molds can be made of thin sheets of stainless steel which can be cut and bent into the desired configurations. The stainless steel can then be treated with a cleaner and appropriate release agent. For example, the stainless steel can be washed with WATERCLEAN and then dried, then given two coats of SEALPROOF sealer and dried, and finally given two coats of WATERSHIELD release agent and dried, all of these products being made by Zyvax, Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., and distributed by Technology Marketing, Inc. of Vancouver, Wash., and Salt Lake City, Utah. A âprepregâ uni-directional carbon fiber composite material including a peel-off protective layer that exposes a self-adhesive surface can then be cut to the approximate shapes of the desired spring element by a razor blade, scissors, cutting die, water jet cutter, or automatic cutting machine. Suitable carbon fiber composite materials for use include F3(C) 50K made by FORTAFIL, AS4C made by HEXCEL, T300 made by TORAY/AMOCO, and in particular, ZMG-2000-Z346-150-35-24â³ which is a 150 GSM material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc., and the like. The individual layers of carbon fiber composite material can have a thickness in the range between approximately 0.13-0.15 mm or 0.005 inches and be affixed to one another to build the desired thickness of the spring elements, but allowing for a reduction of approximately 10 percent due to shrinkage which commonly takes place during the curing process. The individual layers can be alternated in various orientations, e.g., some can be orientated parallel to the length of the desired spring element, and others inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right, or at 90 degrees. The result can be a quasi-isotropic fiber composite material, that is, one having a relatively homogenous flexural modulus in all directions. However, the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the spring element in various orientations can be specifically engineered by varying the number, type, and orientation of the fiber composite layers.
Once the spring element components have been built by adhering the desired number, type, and orientation of glass or carbon fiber composite layers together, the spring element can be rolled or placed under pressure and applied to the stainless steel prototype form or mold. When making prototype spring elements, the carbon fiber composite lay-up including the stainless steel form or mold can be wrapped in a peel ply or perforated release film such as Vac-Pak E 3760 or A 5000 TeflonÂ® FEP, then wrapped in a bleeder such as A 3000 Resin Bleeder/Breather or RC-3000-10A polyester which will absorb excess resin which could leach from the spring elements during curing. This assembly can then be enclosed in a vacuum bagging film, e.g., a Vak-PakÂ® Co-Extruded Nylon Bagging Film such as Vac-Pak HS 800 and all mating edges can be sealed with the use of a sealant tape such as Schnee Morehead vacuum bag tacky tape, or RAP RS200. A vacuum valve can be installed in functional relation to the vacuum bagging film before the vacuum bag is completely sealed. The vacuum valve can be subsequently connected to an autoclave vacuum hose and a vacuum pump, and the assembly can be checked for leaks before placing it in an oven for curing. The entire assembly, while under constant vacuum pressure, can then be placed into an oven and heated at a temperature of approximately 250 degrees Fahrenheit for one to two hours in order to effect setting and curing of the carbon fiber composite spring elements. Upon removal from the oven and cooling, the vacuum bag can be opened and the cured carbon fiber composite spring elements can be removed from within the bleeder and the peel ply or release film, and separated from the stainless steel form or mold. The spring element parts can then possibly be cut or trimmed with a saw, a grinding wheel, a sander, a CNC machine, or with the use of water jet cutting equipment. The fasteners 29 can then be affixed and the spring element installed in functional relation to the upper and outsole of a prototype article of footwear.
The method of making fiber composite materials in a production setting differs depending upon whether thermoplastic or thermoset materials are being used. For example, thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials including their resin coatings are commonly available in flat sheet stock. Parts can then be cut from these sheets using water jet cutting equipment. These parts can then be preheated for a short time in an oven in order to reach a temperature below, but yet relatively close to the melt point of the thermoplastic material, thus rendering the part moldable. Production compression molds are commonly milled from aluminum, then polished and treated with a non-stick coating and release agent. The cost of a single aluminum production compression mold is approximately $2,500. The heated thermoplastic carbon fiber composite parts can then be placed into a relatively cold compression mold and subjected to pressure as the part is simultaneously caused to set and cool. The parts can then be removed and inspected for possible use. One manufacturer of thermoset fiber composite parts is Performance Materials Corporation of 1150 Calle Suerte, Camarillo, Calif. 93012.
The production method and process is different when a thermoset carbon fiber composite uni-directional prepreg material is being used to make a desired part. The uncured layered thermoset part can be placed into an aluminum compression mold which has been preheated to a desired temperature. The mold is closed and the part is then subjected to both heat and pressure. In this regard, the set and cure time of thermoset fiber composite materials is temperature dependent. Generally, the set and cure time for thermoset parts will be about one hour given a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit. However, it is often possible for the same thermoset parts to reach their gel state and take a set, whereupon the shape of the part will be stable, in about one half hour given a temperature of 270 degrees Fahrenheit, in about fifteen minutes given a temperature of 290 degrees Fahrenheit, or in about seven minutes given a temperature of 310 degrees Fahrenheit. Having once reached their gel state and taken a set, the thermoset parts can then be removed from the mold. The parts can later be placed in an oven and subjected to one to two hours of exposure to a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit in order to complete the curing process. Moreover, Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. makes a âquick cureâ thermoset material identified by their product code number 2510 which can completely cure in ten minutes given a mold temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit, and perhaps even faster at higher temperatures.
An alternate method of making thermoset carbon fiber composite spring element components involves making and using a single sided mold having sufficient width to encompass at least one part along the x axis, but the mold can then extend along the y axis for many feet, or vice-versa. For example, the mold can be made of 7075 grade aluminum which can be purchased from Metals USA, Specialty Metals Northwest, Inc. at 3400 S.W. Bond Avenue, in Portland, Oreg. The mold can have a have a width of 16 inches, a length of 30 inches, and maximum thickness of 1Â¼ inches, and be machined to provide a desired configuration using CNC equipment. Accordingly, a relatively long lay-up of carbon fiber material can be placed upon the mold, vacuum bagged, and then cured in an autoclave. For example, ZMG-2000-Z346-150-35-24â³ which is a 150 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. can be used. A thicker material such as 300 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material can be used alone, or alternately, in combination with a 150 GSM material in order to more rapidly build up the thickness of the desired part. A large number of individual components can then be cut from the resulting cured sheet of carbon fiber material. For example, approximately seven full-length superior spring element 47 parts can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon mold having the size recited above. Alternately, approximately fourteen inferior spring elements 50 can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon a mold having the size recited above. The individual parts can be cut with a saber saw, a CNC machine using a vacuum fixture for holding the cured sheet of carbon fiber composite material, or with a multi-dimensional water jet cutter. A provider of water jet cutting services is Hegar Manufacturing of 15600 S.E. FOR/MOR, Clackamas, Oreg. A superior spring element or anterior spring element having a planar configuration, or alternately, a curved shape can be made by this method. Moreover, an inferior spring element having more dramatic curved shape can be made by this method.
An alternate method of making carbon fiber composite parts involves using an injection mold. An uncured carbon fiber material which may or may not already be impregnated with a resin can be placed into an injection mold, and resin can then be injected under pressure and subsequently cured to form a finished part. Alternately, a resin containing short or long glass, carbon, or boron fibers can be injected into a mold and caused to set. The compression and injection mold methods of making fiber composite parts can be advantageous for use when attempting to make components having multiple complex curved shapes. Manufacturers of thermoset fiber composite parts include All Composites of 3206 232nd Street, East Spanayay, Wash. 98387, and Quatro Composites of 12544 Kirkham Court, Number 16, Poway, Calif. 92064.
Alternative methods of making fiber composite parts can include the use of light cure technology, other forms of compression or injection molding, reaction injection molding, and also pulltrusion. Compression molding, injection molding, and reaction injection molding have been widely used in the automotive industry, e.g., the body of the Corvette largely consists of fiber composite construction. Thermoplastic materials, or alternately, thermoset materials including polymers, resins, or epoxies which are rubber toughened that further include glass fiber, aramid fiber, carbon fiber, or boron fiber materials, and the like, can possibly be used. For example, Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich. makes SPECTRUMÂ® reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts, and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton, Pa. makes THERMOCOMPÂ® and VERTONÂ® thermoplastic materials which can include long carbon fibers. Further, PPG of Pittsburgh, Pa., Corning, of Corning, N.Y., and Vetrotex of Valley Forge, Pa., are makers of electrical and structural grade fiberglass products.
 FIG. 2 is a top view showing the superior side 37 of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 1. Shown are the tip 25, vamp 52, insole 55, anterior side 33, posterior side 34, medial side 35, and lateral side 36 of the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22. Also shown is the forefoot area 58, midfoot area 67, rearfoot area 68, and position approximately corresponding to the weight bearing center of the heel 57.
 FIG. 3 is a bottom view showing the inferior side 38 of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 1. Shown is an outsole 43 having a tread or ground engaging surface 53 consisting of anterior outsole element 44 that includes lines of flexion 54, and a posterior outsole element 46 that extends substantially within the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68. Alternately, posterior outsole element 46 can be made in two portions, that is, a posterior outsole element 46 positioned adjacent the posterior side 34 in the rearfoot area 68, and a stabilizer 63 or middle outsole element 45 having a generally triangular shape positioned substantially in the midfoot area 67. For the sake of brevity, both options have been shown simultaneously in FIG. 3. It can be readily understood that stabilizer 63 or middle outsole element 45 can be made in various configurations, and various different stiffness in compression options can be made in order to optimize desired performance characteristics such as cushioning and stability for an individual wearer, or a target population of wearers. In this regard, a stabilizer 63 or middle outsole element 45 can include a foam material, gas filled bladders, viscous fluids, gels, textiles, thermoplastic materials, and the like.
 FIG. 4 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 1, with parts broken away. Shown in FIG. 4 is a two part outsole 43 consisting of anterior outsole element 44, and posterior outsole element 46, each having a backing 30. Also shown are the upper 23, including a tip 25, vamp 52, heel counter 24, fasteners 29, and insole 31. The insole 31 can be made of a foamed or blown neoprene rubber material including a textile cover and having a thickness of approximately 3.75 mm, or a SORBOTHANEÂ®, or PORONÂ® polyurethane foam material including a textile cover. The insole 31 can include a light cure material for providing a custom fit in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,057 granted to the present inventor, and also U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,502 entitled âMethod of Making Custom Insoles and Point of Purchase Display, both of these documents having been previously incorporated by reference herein. The superior spring element 51 underlies the insole 31 and can be configured to approximate the shape of the insole 31 and last bottom about which the upper 23 can be affixed during the manufacturing process, or alternately, to a soft data storage and retrieval computer software three dimensional model relating to the configuration and pattern of the upper 23 of the article of footwear.
The spring element 51 can consist of a plurality of portions, and preferably three portions, an anterior spring element 48, a posterior spring element 49, and an inferior spring element 50 which can be affixed together in functional relation, e.g., with the use of at least one mechanical fastener 29, and the like. The anterior spring element 48 can underlay a substantial portion of the forefoot area 58 and is preferably affixed to the posterior spring element 49 in the forefoot area 58 or midfoot area 67 posterior of a position in the range between approximately 60-70 percent of the length of the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22 as measured from the posterior side 34, that is, a position posterior of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of a wearer's foot when the article of footwear 22 is donned. The metatarsal-phalangeal joints are normally located near approximately 70 percent of foot length on the medial side 35 of the foot, and nearer to approximately 60 percent of foot length on the lateral side 36 of the foot. Accordingly the anterior spring element 48 can underlay the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of the foot and energy can temporarily be stored and later released to generate propulsive force when the anterior spring element 48 undergoes bending during the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle. The anterior spring element 48 can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of damage or failure. Further, a wearer can select from anterior spring elements 48 having different configurations and stiffness, and therefore customize the desired stiffness of the anterior spring element 48 in an article of footwear 22. For example, different individuals having different body weight, running styles, or characteristic running speeds could desire anterior spring elements 48 having different stiffness.
Likewise, the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 46 can be selectively and removably affixed to the inferior spring element 50 in the rearfoot area 68 or midfoot area 67 of the article of footwear 22. Accordingly the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 can underlay a substantial portion of the wearer's rearfoot and perhaps a portion of the wearer's midfoot and energy can be stored during the braking and early stance phases of the running cycle and released during the later portion of the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle to provide propulsive force. The anteriormost portion of wearer's rearfoot on the lateral side of the foot is consistent with the junction between the calcaneus and cuboid bones of the foot which is generally in the range between 25-35 percent of a given foot length and that of a corresponding size upper 23 of an article of footwear 22. The superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, and inferior spring element 50 can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of failure. Further, a wearer can select from superior spring elements 47 or posterior spring elements 49, and inferior spring elements 50 having different configurations and stiffness, and therefore customize the desired stiffness of these spring elements in an article of footwear 22. For example, different individuals having different weight, running styles, or characteristic running speeds could desire to select superior spring elements 47 or posterior spring elements 49, and inferior spring elements 50 having different stiffness.
Accordingly, the spring element 51 of a preferred article of footwear can consist of three portions, an anterior spring element 48 which is positioned anterior of at least approximately 70 percent of the length of the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22 as measured from the posterior side 34, a posterior spring element 49 which extends anteriorly from proximate the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22 and is affixed in functional relation to the anterior spring element 48, and an inferior spring element 50 which is affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element 49. The inferior spring element 50 projects rearwards and downwards and can extend beneath a substantial portion of the rearfoot area 68 of the article of footwear 22. Alternately, the spring element 51 can be formed in two portions or a single part.
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the elevation of the wearer's foot in the rearfoot area 68 measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer's heel 57 is approximately 26 mm, and the elevation of the wearer's foot in the forefoot area 58 measured under the ball of the foot proximate the metatarsal-phalangeal joints is approximately 16 mm in a size 9 men's article of footwear. The difference in elevation between the forefoot area 58 measured under the ball of the foot and the rearfoot area 68 measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer's heel 57 in a men's size 9 article of footwear is commonly in the range between 10-12 mm, and is approximately 10 mm in the embodiment shown in FIG. 4.
For some footwear applications, such as competition in track and field or road racing, the maximum amount of deflection that might be desired by some individuals between the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50 could be in the range between 8-15 mm. As shown in FIG. 4, the maximum amount of deflection possible as between posterior spring element 49 and inferior spring element 50 is approximately 10 mm. However, greater amounts of deflection in the range between 15-50 mm can be desired for use by some individuals in various footwear applications, as shown and discussed herein with respect to other embodiments of the present invention. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous from the standpoint of injury prevention that the elevation of the rearfoot area 68 minus the maximum amount of deflection permitted between the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50 be equal to or greater than the elevation of the forefoot area 58. It can also be advantageous as concerns the longevity of the working life of the spring element 51 that the amount of deflection permitted be equal to or less than approximately 75 percent the maximum distance between the proximate opposing sides of the spring element 51, that is, as between the inferior surface of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the superior surface of the inferior spring element 50.
The amount of deflection or compression provided under the wearer's foot in the forefoot area 58 by the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 is commonly approximately in the range between 4-6 mm, and such can be provided by an insole 31 having a thickness of 3.75 mm in combination with an anterior outsole element 44 having a total thickness of 6.5 mm including a backing 30 having a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm and a tread or ground engaging portion 53 having a thickness of approximately 5 mm, and in particular, when the ground engaging portion 53 is made of a relatively soft and resilient material having good traction, and shock and vibration dampening characteristics. For example, a foamed natural or synthetic rubber or other elastomeric material can be suitable for use. If hypothetically, an outsole material having advantageous traction, and shock and vibration dampening characteristics only lasts 200 miles during use, that is, as opposed to perhaps 300 miles associated with a harder and longer wearing outsole material, this does not pose a practical problem, as the outsole 43 portions can be easily renewed in the present invention, whereas a conventional article of footwear would normally be discarded. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain better traction, and shock and vibration dampening characteristics in the present invention, as the durability of the outsole 43 portions is not such an important criteria.
 FIG. 5 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 1, with parts broken away. Shown in dashed lines is the medial aspect of the inferior spring element 50. It can be advantageous that the flexural axis 59 be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees in an article of footwear intended for use in walking or running. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the flexural axis 59 is deviated at about 35 degrees from the transverse axis 91 of the article of footwear 22.
It can be readily understood that posterior of the flexural axis 59 the length of the superior lever arm 60 and inferior lever arm 61 formed along the medial side 35 of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50 are shorter than the length of the corresponding superior lever arm 60.1 and inferior lever arm 61.1 formed along the lateral side 36 of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50. Accordingly, when the inferior spring element 50 is affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and is subject to compressive loading, the inferior spring element 50 exhibits less stiffness in compression at the lateral and posterior corner, and increasing stiffness in compression both anteriorly and laterally. Again, it can be advantageous for enhancing rearfoot stability during walking or running that the spring element 51 including inferior spring element 50 exhibit approximately two to three times the stiffness in compression on the medial side 35 relative to the stiffness exhibited on the lateral side 36. Further, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the inferior aspect of the spring element 51 has a concave configuration in the midfoot area 67, that is, between the inferiormost portion of the anterior spring element 48 in the forefoot area 58 and the inferiormost portion of the inferior spring element 50 in the rearfoot area 68. It can be readily understood that the configuration of this concavity 76 and the flexural modulus of the spring element 51, as well as the stiffness of the anterior outsole element 44, middle outsole element 45, posterior outsole element 46, anterior spacer 55, and posterior spacer 42 can be engineered to provide optimal cushioning characteristics such as deflection with respect to the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68 for an individual wearer, or for a target population having similar needs and requirements.
 FIG. 6 is a top view of a spring element 51 in the article of footwear 22 similar to that shown in FIG. 2, but having a relatively more curved shape corresponding to a relatively more curve lasted upper 23 shown in dashed lines. Shown is a spring element 51 consisting of a single full length superior spring element 47.
 FIG. 7 is a top view of a two part spring element 51 consisting of anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49 in the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 2, with the upper 23 shown in dashed lines.
 FIG. 8 is a top view of a two part spring element 51 consisting of anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49 in an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 2, but having a relatively more curved shape corresponding to a relatively more curve lasted upper 23 which is shown in dashed lines. The anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49 can be affixed with three fasteners 29 in triangulation. The posterior spring element 48 can include a projection 70 proximate the longitudinal axis 69 of the article of footwear 22. The configuration of this projection 70 can at least partially determine the torsional rigidity of the assembled spring element 51 consisting of anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49, thus the degree to which the forefoot area 58 can be rotated inwards or outwards about the longitudinal axis 69. Further, the number, dimension, and location of the fasteners 29 used to affix the anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49 can affect both the flexural modulus of the superior spring element 47 along the length of the longitudinal axis 69, but also rotationally about the longitudinal axis 69, that is, the torsional modulus of the superior spring element 47. A portion of the anterior spring element 48 is shown broken away in order to reveal the optional inclusion of an anterior spacer 55 between the anterior spring element 48 and the posterior spring element 49.
As shown in FIG. 8, an anterior spacer 55 which can possibly consist of a cushioning medium or cushioning means having desired spring and dampening characteristics can be inserted in the area between the anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49, that is, within an area of possible overlap as between the two components. The configuration and compressive, flexural, and torsional stiffness of an anterior spacer 55 can be used to modify the overall configuration and performance of a spring element 51 and article of footwear 22. In this regard, an anterior spacer 55 can have uniform height, or alternately an anterior spacer 55 can have varied height. Further, an anterior spacer 55 can exhibit uniform compressive, flexural, and torsional stiffness throughout, or alternately an anterior spacer 55 can exhibit different compressive, flexural, and torsional stiffness in different locations. These varied characteristics of an anterior spacer 55 can be used to enhance the cushioning, stability and overall performance of an article of footwear 22 for a unique individual wearer, or for a target population of wearers. For example, an anterior spacer 55 having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation, supination, and inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer's foot during portions of the walking or running gait cycle, and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus. The relevant methods and techniques for making corrections of this kind are relatively well known to qualified medical doctors, podiatrists, and physical therapists. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,620, 4,578,882, 4,620,376, 4,642,911, 4,949,476, and 5,921,004, all of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Normally, an anterior spacer 55 having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the lateral to the medial side, or one which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the medial side can be used to compensate for a forefoot varus condition, whereas an anterior spacer 55 having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the medial to the lateral side, or one which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the lateral side can be used to compensate for a forefoot valgus condition. An individual with a profound anatomical condition such as varus or valgus, or having a history of injury would be prudent to consult with a trained medical doctor when contemplating modification to their articles of footwear. Further, an anterior spacer 55 can also have a wedge or complex curved shape along the longitudinal axis 69, that is, in the posterior to anterior orientation, and various configurations of an anterior spacer 55 can be provided which can be used to modify the amount of toe spring 62 and the overall conformance of a spring element 51 and article of footwear 22, as desired.
 FIG. 9 is a bottom view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 3, with the anterior outsole element 44 and posterior outsole element 46 removed to reveal the anterior spring element 48, posterior spring element 49, and inferior spring element 50. The flexural axis 59 of inferior spring element 50 is deviated approximately 35 degrees from the transverse axis 91. This configuration can be advantageous for use by distance runners who otherwise tend to pronate significantly during the braking and stance phases of the running cycle. Further, a portion of the inferior spring element 50 is shown broken away to reveal the optional use of a posterior spacer 42 which can serve a role in functional relation to the inferior spring element 50 and the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 analogous to that of the anterior spacer 55 which can be used as between the anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49. Further, a posterior spacer 42 can also have a wedge or complex curved shape along the longitudinal axis 69, that is, in the posterior to anterior orientation, and various configurations of a posterior spacer 42 can be provided which can be used to modify the overall conformance of a spring element 51 and article of footwear 22, as desired.
It can be readily understood that in this specification and the associated drawing figures, the orientation and location of the longitudinal axis 69 is determined by longitudinally bisecting the rearfoot area 68 of the article of footwear 22, and likewise, any related components that are present in the rearfoot area 68 such as the inferior spring element 50, and also the posterior portion of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49. It is recognized that a longitudinal axis 69 drawn in this manner will not bisect the forefoot area 58 of an article of footwear 22 having a substantially curve lasted configuration. The orientation of the transverse axis 91 can be determined by drawing a line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 69 as defined above, that is, the transverse axis 91 intersects the longitudinal axis 69 at a 90 degree angle. Accordingly, when an article of footwear 22 or component such as an inferior spring element 50 is recited as including or having a longitudinal axis 69 or transverse axis 91, it can be readily understood that this refers to the aforementioned defined coordinate system for describing, e.g., the orientation, relationship, or various specific features of the sub-components which are part of an article of footwear made according to the present invention.
 FIG. 10 is a bottom view of an alternate article of footwear 22 with the anterior outsole element 44 and posterior outsole element 46 removed to reveal anterior spring element 48, posterior spring element 49 and an alternate configuration of inferior spring element 50. The flexural axis 59 of inferior spring element 50 is deviated approximately 30 degrees from the transverse axis 91. The anterior spring element 48, posterior spring element 49, and inferior spring element 50 are shown affixed together in an overlapping relationship in FIGS. 9 and 10. However, it can be readily understood that various components of a spring element 51 can be affixed in function relation with the use of adhesives, mating male and female parts such as tongue and groove, or other configurations and devices known in the prior art.
The possible use of notches 71 or openings 72 in order to diminish the stiffness in bending or flexural modulus exhibited by a portion of spring element 51, and two substantially transverse lines of flexion 54 is also shown in FIG. 10. Shown with a dashed line 90 in FIG. 10, and also in medial side view in FIG. 14, is the possible inclusion of a rocker 87 configuration in the forefoot area 58 of the sole 32 an article of footwear 22. It can be advantageous for the point of greatest elevation of the rocker 87 to be located approximately in the range between 1-4 cm posterior of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The location of the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint 88 on the medial side 35 of an average wearer's foot is normally at slightly less than seventy percent of foot length, and the location of the fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 on the lateral side 36 is normally somewhat greater than sixty percent of foot length as measured from the posterior side 34 of the wearer's foot. Accordingly, a rocker 87 can be positioned in the range between 1-4 cm behind a generally transverse and slightly diagonal line that can be drawn as between these two approximate positions for any given size article of footwear.
 FIG. 11 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 1, with parts broken away, but having a forefoot area 58 without substantial toe spring 62. This particular article of footwear 22 can be suitable for use in activities such as tennis, volleyball, or basketball.
 FIG. 12 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 11, with parts broken away, having a forefoot area 58 without substantial toe spring 62, but including an anterior outsole element 44, foam midsole 26, and upper 23 which are affixed together with the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 13 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 12, with parts broken away, having a forefoot area 58 without substantial toe spring 62, but including a detachable anterior outsole element 44 and foam midsole 26.
 FIG. 14 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 similar to that shown in FIG. 4, further including a spring guard 40. The spring guard 40 can be made of a relatively soft resilient material such as a foam material, or a natural or synthetic rubber. The spring guard 40 can prevent foreign matter from becoming lodged in the area proximate the junction of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50, thus can prevent damage to spring element 51. The spring guard 40 can be affixed to the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, or to the inferior spring element 50, or to both portions of the spring element 51. Alternately, the spring guard 40 can form a portion and extension of posterior spacer 42, as shown in FIG. 18. Further, the spring guard 40 can also serve as a vibration decay time modifier 41, as shown in FIG. 20. Also shown in FIG. 14 is the approximate position of the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint 88 on the medial side 35, and a sole 32 or outsole 43 including a rocker 87 configuration in the forefoot area 58. As shown, the rocker 87 configuration can be formed and substantially consist of a portion of the sole 32 or outsole 43, or alternately, the rocker 87 configuration can be formed at least in part by an inferiorly protruding portion of the spring element 51, and in particular, the anterior spring element 48.
 FIG. 15 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 4, with parts broken away, having a upper 23 including a sleeve 39 for accommodating the superior spring element 47. The sleeve 39 can be formed in a portion of the upper 23 inferior to the insole 31, and can possibly consist of a portion of the t-sock 56. The spring element 51 can include an inferior spring element 50, and a superior spring element 47 that can include an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49. The superior spring element 47 can be positioned within sleeve 39, thus at least partially retaining the superior spring element 47 in functional relation to the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22.
Further, in contrast with the configuration of inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 16, an alternate inferior spring element 50.1 is shown in FIG. 15. The alternate inferior spring element 50.1 descends from proximate the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and attains maximum separation therefrom. The inferior spring element 50.1 can then possibly extend posteriorly in a parallel relationship with respect to the overlaying superior spring element 47. However, the inferior spring element 50.1 then curves upwards as the inferior spring element 50.1 extends towards the posterior side 34 of the article of footwear 22. It can sometimes be advantageous that the inferior spring element 50.1 be tapered in the range between approximately 1-15 degrees, or otherwise be curved upwards, as it extends towards the posterior side 34 and lateral side 36 corner of the sole 32 of the article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 16 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 4, with parts broken away. However, this alternate embodiment does not include an additional covering such as a coating, textile, or outsole 43 on the inferior side of the upper 23, as shown in FIG. 4. Accordingly, the inferior side of the upper 23 is in direct contact with the superior side of the backing 30 of the outsole 43, that is, anterior outsole element 44 and posterior outsole element 46 when the article of footwear 22 is assembled. Further, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the backing 30 of an outsole 43 can be made of a material having sufficient flexural modulus and resilience as to simultaneously serve as a spring element of the article of footwear, as shown in FIG. 16. Accordingly, the anterior spring element can consist of two portions, anterior spring element 48, and anterior spring element 48.1, which also serves as the backing 30 of anterior outsole element 44.
In the article of footwear shown in FIG. 16, when a line is drawn parallel to the ground support surface and tangent to the inferior surface of the superior spring element 47 in the forefoot area 58, the approximate slope of the superior spring element 47 as it extends posteriorly is approximately five degrees. When affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49, the inferior spring element 50 projects downwards and rearwards therefrom before attaining the desired amount of separation between the components which at least partially determines the maximum amount of deflection that the resulting spring element 51 can provide. As shown in FIG. 16 and several other drawing figures, once the inferior spring element 50 descends and attains the desired amount of separation, the inferior spring element 50 extends posteriorly in a substantially parallel relationship with respect to the corresponding overlaying portion of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49. Accordingly, after descending from proximate the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and establishing the desired amount of separation, the inferior spring element 50 does not curve upwards as it extends towards the posterior side 34 of the article of footwear 22. Instead, it is known in prior art articles of footwear, and can also be advantageous in the present invention for a portion of the outsole 43 near the posterior side 34, and in particular, proximate the posterior side 34 and lateral side 36 corner, to be tapered in the range between 1-15 degrees, or otherwise curved upwards. However, the overall configuration of the article of footwear 22 including the amount of toe spring 62 and the aforementioned slope of the superior spring element 47 can influence or determine the amount of slope or curvature that is advantageous to incorporate in this portion of the outsole 43.
 FIG. 17 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 4, having a upper 23 affixed to superior spring element 47, with parts broken away. The upper 23 is affixed to the top or superior surface of superior spring element 47, thus the superior spring element 47 can be exposed on its bottom or inferior surface. Accordingly, the superior surface of the outsole 43 portions including backing 30 can be placed in direct contact with the superior spring element 47 when they are affixed into position.
 FIG. 18 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 similar to that shown in FIG. 17, further including a posterior spacer 42. As shown in FIG. 18, a posterior spacer 42 can include a spring guard 40. As shown in FIG. 20, a spring guard 40 can further include a vibration decay time modifier 41. The posterior spacer 42 can serve to at least partially isolate the superior spring element 47, upper 23 and wearer from the transmission of shock and vibration which could be imparted by the inferior spring element 50 and posterior outsole element 46 caused by an impact event.
It can be readily understood that a posterior spacer 42 can serve a purpose analogous to that of anterior spacer 55, and vice-versa. Accordingly, a posterior spacer 42 can consist of a cushioning medium or cushioning means having desired spring and dampening characteristics. The posterior spacer 42 can be inserted between the inferior spring element 50 and posterior spring element 49, that is, within an area of possible overlap as between the two components. The configuration and stiffness of a posterior spacer 42 can be used to modify the overall configuration and performance of a spring element 51 and article of footwear 22. In this regard, a posterior spacer 42 can have uniform height, or alternately a posterior spacer 42 can have varied height. Further, a posterior spacer 42 can exhibit uniform compressive, flexural, or torsional stiffness throughout, or alternately can exhibit different properties in different locations. These varied characteristics of a posterior spacer 42 can be used to enhance the cushioning and/or stability of an article of footwear 22 for an unique individual wearer, or for a target population of wearers.
For example, a posterior spacer 42 having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation, supination, inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer's foot during phases of the walking or running gait cycle, and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus. Again, the relevant methods and techniques for making corrections of this kind are relatively well known to qualified medical doctors, podiatrists, and physical therapists. Normally, a posterior spacer 42 having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the lateral to the medial side, or a posterior spacer 42 which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the medial side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot pronation, whereas a posterior spacer 42 having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the medial to the lateral side, or a posterior spacer 42 which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the lateral side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot supination. An individual having a profound anatomical condition such as varus or valgus, an individual who dramatically pronates or supinates, or an individual who has a history of injury would be prudent to consult with a trained medical doctor when contemplating modification to their articles of footwear.
It can be readily understood that with the use of an anterior spacer 55 positioned between anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49, and a posterior spacer 42 positioned between the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50, that the configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot area 58, midfoot area 67, and rearfoot area 68 of an article of footwear 22 can be adjusted and customized as desired by an individual wearer. Further, the use of an anterior spacer 55 and/or posterior spacer 42 having a select configuration can be used to adjust the amount of support provided by a superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 which can possibly further include contours for mating with the complex curved shapes of a wearer's foot. For example, it is possible to customize the amount of support that is provided to the medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal and transverse arches, and to the sides of a wearer's foot.
 FIG. 19 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having a posterior spacer 22 including a spring guard 40, and also a vibration decay time modifier 41 having a stem 64 and a head 65. The vibration decay time modifier 41 can be affixed in function relation to a portion of spring element 51, and in particular, a portion of an inferior spring element 50. The head 65 of the vibration decay time modifier 41 can be dimensioned and configured for vibration substantially free of contact with a spring element 51 in directions which substantially encompass a 360 degree arc and normal to the longitudinal axis of the stem 64, that is, when the vibration decay time modifier 41 is initially excited by shock and vibration. When the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and inferior spring element 50 are subjected to compressive loading a vibration decay time modifier 41 can also serve as a stop and prevent any possible impact between these elements. The inclusion of a posterior spacer 42 and/or a vibration decay time modifier 41 can partially attenuate shock and vibration associated with impact events associated with movements such as walking or running, and can reduce the vibration decay time following an impact event. This can serve to enhance comfort, proprioception, reduce local trauma, and possibly solicit greater application of force and improved athletic performance.
Generally, the efficiency of a vibration decay time modifier will be enhanced the closer it is positioned in functional relation to a negative nodal point. When properly configured and placed proximate the negative nodal point of an object or implement, relatively little mass is required in order to substantially prevent, or alternately, to attenuate resonant vibration within fractions of a second. A negative nodal point is a point at which a substantial portion of the vibration energy in an excited object or implement will pass when it is excited by energy associated with an impact or other vibration producing event. Discussion of modes of vibration and negative nodal points can be found in Arthur H. Benade, Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics, 2nd edition, New York: Dover Publications, 1990, Harry F. Olson, Music, Physics and Engineering, 2nd edition, New York: Dover Publications, 1967, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,941,380 granted to Francois Rene Lacoste on Mar. 2, 1976, this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
A technology taught by Steven C. Sims in U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,046, granted Nov. 4, 1994, this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein, has been commercialized by Wilson Sporting Goods, Inc. into the SLEDGEHAMMERÂ® INTUNEÂ® tennis rackets, and by Hillerich and Bradsby Company, Inc. in the LOUISVILLE SLUGGERÂ® SIMS STINGSTOPÂ® aluminum baseball and softball bats, as well as the POWERBUILTÂ® SIMS SHOCK RELIEFÂ® golf club line, and LIMBSAVERÂ® product for archery. These products substantially eliminate the vibration and stinging associated with impact events experienced by a wielder's hands. Certain aspects of the aforementioned teachings can be applied in the present invention in order to accomplish a similar results with regards to an article of footwear 22 and the lower extremities of a wearer.
The source of shock and vibration can derive from a relatively controlled and harmonic movement, such as when a wearer repeatedly impacts the pavement while running in an article of footwear 22. Further, the source of shock and vibration can be random in nature, as when a wearer rides a wheeled vehicle such as a bicycle or motorcycle over rough terrain. Alternately, the source of shock and vibration can be constant and mechanically driven as when a wearer rides a bicycle, or a motor vehicle such as a motorcycle or snowmobile. A shock wave, that is, a shock pulse or discontinuity can travel at the speed of sound in a given medium. In the human body, the speed of sound in bone is approximately 3,200 meters/second, and in soft tissue approximately 1,600 meters/second. A shock wave traveling in a relatively dense fluid medium such as water has approximately five times the power that it does in a less dense fluid medium such as air. It is important to recognize that the human body is largely comprised of water and like fluid medium.
When a metal bell is struck, the bell will resonate and continue to ring for an extended time while the vibration energy is gradually dampened out. When a small bell is rung, one can place one's hand upon it and silence it. In that case, the primary dampening means for attenuating the resulting shock and vibration is the anatomy of the human subject. The same thing can happen when an impact event takes place as between an individual's foot and the materials which are used in an athletic shoe, and a running surface. When an individual runs on an asphalt surface in running shoes, the sound of the impact event that one hears is the audible portion of the shock wave that has been generated as result of the impact.
Many individuals know from experience that a vibrating implement or object can numb the hands. This is even more true when the source of the vibration is continuous and driven as when power equipment is being used. Associated with that numbness can be pain, reduced sensation and proprioception, and reduced muscular effort and performance as the body responds to protect itself from a perceived source of trauma and injury. Chronic exposure to high levels of vibration can result in a medical condition known as white finger disease. Generally, the lower extremities of most individuals are not subject to high levels of driven vibration. However, bicycle riders wearing relatively rigid articles of footwear can experience constant driven vibration, thus their feet can become numb or âgo to sleepâ over time. Motorcycle riders can also experience the same phenomenon.
The preferred article of footwear includes spring and dampening means for at least partially attenuating shock and vibration, that is, the initial shock pulse, pressure wave, or discontinuity and associated peak g's that are imparted to a wearer due to an impact event. At a cellular or molecular level, such vibration energy is believed to disturb normal functions such as blood flow in tendon tissue. Given appropriate engineering with respect to the characteristic or desired spring stiffness, mass, deflection, frequency, dampening, and percent transmissibility, an article of footwear of the present invention can partially attenuate shock and vibration. Viscous, friction, and mechanical dampening means can be used to attain this end. It is known that the mean power frequency associated with the rearfoot impact event in running generally corresponds to 20 Herz, and that of the forefoot to 5 Herz. The design and configuration, as well as the spring and dampening characteristics of a spring element 51, posterior spacer 42, and vibration decay time modifier 41 can be engineered so as to target these frequencies and provide a specific characteristic tuned mechanical response.
An anterior spacer 55, posterior spacer 42, and vibration decay time modifier 41 can be made of a cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a natural or synthetic rubber material, or a resilient elastomer such as polyurethane. In this regard, thermoset or thermoplastic materials can be used. Thermoplastic materials can be less expensive to produce as they can be readily injection molded. In contrast, thermoset materials are often compression molded using a relatively time and energy consuming vulcanization process. However, some thermoset materials can possess superior dampening properties and durability. Dampening materials which can be cured with the use of ultrasonic energy, microwave, visible or ultraviolet light, radio frequency, or other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used. Room temperature cure elastomers, such as moisture or evaporation cure, or catalytic cure resilient materials can also be used. A suitable dampening material can be made of a butyl, chloroprene, polynorborene, neoprene, or silicone rubber, and the like. Alternately, a dampening material can be made of an elastomeric material such as polyurethane, or SORBOTHANEÂ®. Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations can also be used, including dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems, 338 Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44311, e.g., SANTOPRENEÂ®, VYRAMÂ®, GEOLASTÂ®, and TREFSINÂ®. SANTOPRENEÂ® is known to consist of a combination of butyl rubber and ethylene-propylene. Generally, other materials developed for use in the audio industry for dampening vibration such as EAR ISODAMPÂ®, SINATRAÂ®, EYDEXÂ®, and the like, or combinations thereof, can be used. Fillers such as organic or inorganic microspheres, carbon black or other conventional fillers can be used. Plasticizing agents such as fluids or oils can be used to modify the physical and mechanical properties of the dampening material in a desired manner. The preferred dampening material has transition characteristics suitable for the expected operational temperature of an article of footwear 22, and other physical and mechanical properties well suited to dampen shock and vibration and reduce vibration decay time.
It can be advantageous that the dampening material used to make a solitary vibration decay time modifier 41 including a stem 64 and a head 65 have a hardness in the range of 10-30 durometer, and preferably approximately 20 durometer on the Shore A scale. A relatively soft dampening material is capable a dampening a wide range of exciting vibration frequencies, and also relatively low vibration frequencies. However, a harder dampening material having greater shear and tear strength can sometimes be advantageous for use when making an anterior spacer 55 or posterior spacer 42 due to the magnitude of the loads which can be placed upon these components during use. A vibration decay time modifier 41 can be affixed to spring element 51 by conventional means such as adhesive, mechanically mating parts, chemical bonding, heat and pressure welding, radio frequency welding, compression molding, injection molding, photocuring, and the like.
In a conventional article of footwear having a foam midsole and rubber outsole, the materials located between the wearer's foot and the inferior ground engaging surface of the outsole normally become compressed during footstrike and subsequent loading of the sole. During compressive loading the stiffness of these materials increases linearly or geometrically and as result the ability of the sole to dampen shock and vibration rapidly diminishes. Further, the area of the sole which transmits most of the shock and vibration can be relatively small and localized. In this regard, the energy associated with a shock pulse or discontinuity passes tends to pass quickly by the shortest route and through the hardest or stiffest material in which it is in communication. Again, the transmission of shock and vibration is extremely fast in the human body and the materials used in conventional articles of footwear. In a conventional article of footwear, the shock and vibration resulting from impact with the support surface is rapidly transmitted through the outsole, midsole, upper and insole and into a wearer's foot.
However, in the present invention the shock and vibration generated proximate the inferior ground engaging surface 53 of the outsole 43 must travel anteriorly along the outsole 43 and inferior spring element 50 before being transmitted to the superior spring element 47, upper 23 and wearer, thus for a greater distance relative to a conventional article of footwear. This affords more time and space in which to attenuate and dampen shock and vibration. Further, in the present invention the outsole 43 can be made of a softer material having better shock and vibration dampening characteristics than is normally the case in a conventional article of footwear. In addition, a posterior spacer 42 can serve as a shock and vibration isolator between the inferior spring element 50 and the superior spring element 47, upper 23, and wearer's foot. Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, at least one vibration decay time modifier 41 can be positioned in direct communication with inferior spring element 50 in order to dampen shock and vibration before it can be transmitted to a wearer. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning, shock and vibration isolation, and dampening effects relative to conventional footwear constructions.
 FIG. 20 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including a posterior spacer 42 similar to that shown in FIG. 18. As shown in FIG. 20, a posterior spacer 42 can include a spring guard 40 and at least one protrusion which can be configured and engineered to serve as a vibration decay time modifier 41.
 FIG. 21 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 1, but having various components including the upper 23, spring element 51, and outsole 43 affixed together with the use of adhesives in the manner of a conventional article of footwear.
 FIG. 22 is a bottom view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 3, having a spring element 51 configured for accommodating a detachable bicycle cleat 73. The article of footwear 22 can then serve as bicycling shoe, and possibly also as a functional upper 23 for an in-line skate, as taught in the applicant's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/628,540 entitled âWheeled Skate With Step-In Binding And Brakes,â hereby incorporated by reference herein.
Also shown in FIG. 22 is flexural axis 59, and with the use of a dashed line, an alternate position of flexural axis 59.1 with reference to the longitudinal axis 69. It can be readily understood that other more anterior or more posterior positions of a flexural axis 59 with reference to the longitudinal axis 69 are possible. The position of the flexural axis 59 can be selected in order to influence or determine the physical and mechanical properties of a spring element 51, and the overall conformance and performance of an article of footwear 22, as desired. Generally, it can be advantageous that the posteriormost portion of the flexural axis on the medial side be located in the range between 1-6 inches from the posterior side of the upper, and in particular, in the range between 2-4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. However, in the footwear embodiment shown in FIG. 22, it can be advantageous both with respect to the stability of the preferred article of footwear 22, but also the weight and cost of the spring element, that the posteriormost position of the flexural axis 59 on the medial side 35 be located approximately in the range between 1-3.5 inches from the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 in a men's size 9 article of footwear 22. The method of grading and scaling various footwear components for other men's or women's sizes is well known in the footwear industry, thus the preferred range as concerns the position of the flexural axis 59 on the medial side 32 can be determined from this information for any given size article of footwear 22.
It can be readily understood that this teaching concerning the angular orientation of the flexural axis 59 with reference to the longitudinal axis 69 can be applied to other embodiments of a preferred article of footwear 22. Possible angular deviation of the flexural axis 59 from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees was previously discussed. One advantage to using a flexural axis 59 that is deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees is that it permits the use of an inferior spring element 50 having a relatively homogenous construction and a substantially uniform thickness, and this both serves to reduce manufacturing costs and enhances product reliability. It can be readily understood that various combinations and permutations with respect to the position of the flexural axis 59 with reference to the longitudinal axis 69 and the angular deviation of the flexural axis 59 from the transverse axis 91 can be functional.
 FIG. 23 is a medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 17, but having the anterior outsole element 44, posterior outsole element 46, and inferior spring element 50 removed, and further including track spike elements 66. This embodiment can facilitate enhanced athletic performance and can be used by track and field athletes in the sprinting and jumping events. Further, the spring element 51 can extend upwards about the area of the heel to form an integral heel counter 24, as shown in FIG. 23. In addition, the spring element 51 can extend upwards about the lateral side 36 of the forefoot area 58 to form a side support 74, as shown with dashed lines in FIG. 23. Various configurations of a side support 74 and/or an integral heel counter 24 can be incorporated in any or all embodiments of a preferred article of footwear 22, as desired. Moreover, the superior spring element 47 used in any or all embodiments of a preferred article of footwear 22 can be configured to mate with or otherwise support the complex curved shapes and structures associated with the anatomy of the human foot.
 FIG. 24 is a cross sectional view of the anterior spacer 55 included in the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 8, taken along line 24-24. As shown in FIG. 24, the anterior spacer 55 has a uniform elevation.
 FIG. 25 is a cross sectional view of an alternate anterior spacer 55.1 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 8, but having a wedge shape 28, taken along a line consistent with line 24-24. As shown in FIG. 25, the anterior spacer 55.1 has a wedge shape 28 which slopes upward from the lateral side 36 to the medial side 35.
 FIG. 26 is a cross sectional view of the posterior spacer 42 included in the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 9, taken along line 26-26. As shown in FIG. 26, the posterior spacer 42 has a uniform elevation.
 FIG. 27 is a cross sectional view of an alternate posterior spacer generally similar to that shown in FIG. 9, but having a wedge shape, taken along a line consistent with line 26-26. As shown in FIG. 27, the posterior spacer 42.1 has a wedge shape 28 which slopes upward from the lateral side 36 to the medial side 35.
 FIGS. 24-27 have been provided to illustrate a few of the possible configurations of an anterior spacer 55 and posterior spacer 22, and other variations are both possible and anticipated. For example, the configuration and slope of the wedge shapes 28 can be the opposite of that represented, and the anterior spacer 55 and/or posterior spacer 22 can slope upwards from the medial side 35 to the lateral side 36. Further, the anterior spacer 55 and/or posterior spacer 22 can have more complex or compound curved shapes. In addition, it can be readily understood that the amount of elevation and/or degree of slope of the anterior spacer 55 and/or posterior spacer 42 can be varied. The compressive, flexural and torsional stiffness of different anterior spacers 55 and/or posterior spacers 22 can also be varied. Moreover, an anterior spacer 55 and/or posterior spacer 22 can be made to exhibit differential stiffness in different portions.
Again, an anterior spacer 55 or posterior spacer 42 can also have a wedge or complex curved shape along the longitudinal axis 69, that is, in the posterior to anterior orientation, and various configurations can be provided which can be used to modify the overall conformance of a spring element 51 and article of footwear 22, as desired. Accordingly, many variables can be manipulated and selected to optimize the configuration and performance of an article of footwear for an individual, or for a given target population having similar characteristics and requirements.
 FIG. 28 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having a different configuration of a spring element 51, with parts broken away. In this embodiment, the anterior spring element 48 and inferior spring element 50 can be affixed in functional relation with the use of mechanical means such as fasteners 29, and the like, or alternately be formed as a single component identified herein as anterior and inferior spring element 75. The anterior portion of the spring element 51 can pass through a slit in the t-sock 56 or upper 23 and then be affixed with fasteners 29 to outsole 43, thereby firmly securing the upper 23 in functional relation thereto. As shown, the posterior spring element 49 can be affixed to the posterior portion of the spring element 51 with at least one fastener 29, and a posterior spacer 42 can also be inserted therebetween. Alternately, the posterior spacer 42 be formed as a coating or otherwise consist of a portion of the t-sock 56 or upper 23. As shown in FIG. 28, the posterior spring element 49 can be made to further include an integral heel counter 24.
 FIG. 29 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including a superior spring element 47, and a selectively removable sole 32 made of a more conventional cushioning medium or cushioning means such as an EVA or polyurethane foam material, a fluid-filled bladder, and a thermoplastic or thermoset rubber outsole. As shown, the sole 32 does not include an inferior spring element 50 made of a fiber composite material or metal. However, the posterior portion of the sole 32 consisting of a conventional cushioning medium or cushioning means such as an EVA or polyurethane foam material, a fluid-filled bladder, and a thermoplastic or thermoset rubber outsole can be made such as to be removable, thus an inferior spring element 50 made of a fiber composite material or metal could alternately be used, as desired. In this patent application, the terms or phrases âcushioning mediumâ or âcushioning meansâ shall mean any and all forms of matter, structure, energy, or force capable of attenuating the impact events commonly experienced with the use of articles of footwear. Accordingly, the terms or phrases âcushioning mediumâ or âcushioning meansâ can be used to indicate relatively conventional cushioning materials or devices, e.g., an EVA or polyurethane foam material, or a fluid-filled bladder, but also a spring element 51 solely consisting of a superior spring element 47, or alternately, a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50, and the like.
The superior spring element 47 can have the approximate configuration of the bottom net of a corresponding last 80 or other hard template, model, or pattern. Alternately, the superior spring element 47 can be made in accordance with a soft model created and maintained in a data storage and retrieval computer environment. A superior spring element 47 can possibly simultaneously consist and serve as a lasting board 79, and vice-versa. However, not every structure and material composition of a lasting board 79 would be such as to possibly create or serve as a spring element 51. A lasting board 79 can be made of wood, cellulose, cardboard, or other natural fiber, reconstituted leather, a textile formed by knitting or weaving, a non-woven textile, a textile formed by stitch bonding, metal such as steel, spring steel, aluminum, or titanium, a thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, an elastomer such as polyurethane, thermoplastic rubber or other natural or synthetic rubber, or alternately, as preferred and previously discussed in detail, a fiber composite material such as carbon fiber.
The sole 32 can include separate midsole 26 and outsole 43 components, or can be made as a single component. Various sole 32 components can be made having different physical and mechanical characteristics, and performance capabilities for possible selection and use by a wearer. The sole 32 can be selectively removed and replaced by a wearer in order to customize the article of footwear 22, or to renew a component, as desired. As shown in FIG. 29, the spring element 51 does not include an inferior spring element 50, rather the spring element 51 consists of a superior spring element 47, or an anterior spring element 48 and posterior spring element 49 which are affixed in functional relation.
 FIG. 30 shows a bottom view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having an anterior lasting board 79 positioned in the forefoot area 58. Also shown is a portion of the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 including a plurality openings 72 which can be made to register with corresponding openings 72 in an anterior lasting board 79, thus enabling the use of a plurality of fasteners 29 to affix the upper 23 in functional relation to the anterior lasting board 79, and a sole 32 which can possibly include a midsole 26 and outsole 43, or merely an outsole 43. The article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 30 also consists of a slip-lasted construction in the forefoot area 58 including a t-sock 56 to which the upper 23 is affixed by stitching or adhesive, or other conventional means. The t-sock 56 can consist of a substantially non-stretchlastic textile material, but preferably consists of a stretchlastic textile material. Alternately, the t-sock 56 can be made of cellulose, paper, cardboard, or other natural fiber, reconstituted leather, a textile formed by knitting or weaving, a non-woven textile, a textile formed by stitch bonding, a thin film or sheet consisting of thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and the like, an elastomer such as polyurethane, thermoplastic rubber or other natural or synthetic rubber. Alternately, the upper 23 can consist of a different type of slip lasted construction, a moccasin construction, a string lasted construction, or another conventional footwear construction known in the art. The article of footwear 22 can include a sole 32 in the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68 which is affixed to the upper 23 in a conventional manner with the use of adhesives. Alternately, the sole 32 can be affixed to a full length lasting board 79, or a posterior lasting board 79 with the use of fasteners 29.
It can be readily understood that within certain practical limitations, different lasting boards 79 having different configurations possibly including different lengths, foot shapes, and widths can be used with a given upper 23 in order to customize the fit of an article of footwear 22 for a unique individual or target population. For example, a plurality of lasting boards 79 can be developed for use with different target populations consisting of individuals having generally similar anatomical characteristics and foot dimensions. Further, it can also be readily understood that within certain practical limitations, different uppers 23 having different configurations possibly including different lengths, widths, and foot shapes can be used with a given lasting board 79 in order to customize the fit of an article of footwear 22 for a unique individual or target population. For example, a plurality of uppers 23 can be developed for use with different target populations consisting of individuals having generally similar anatomical characteristics and foot dimensions.
 FIG. 31 shows a bottom view of the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 30, but including two alternate openings 72 at a plurality of different positions at which a fastener 29 can be used. In the American sizing system, a change in length by one size corresponds to â inch, and changes in width as between respective sizes A, B, C, D, and E are associated with increments of Â¼ inch. Further, the increments in length and width associated with other sizing systems are also known. Given an upper 23 having two alternate openings 72 that are separated by Â¼ inch for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used, and in particular, about the forefoot area 58, it is possible for the article of footwear 22 to provide three possible options such as width sizes B, C, and D. For example, if the openings 72 closest to the lateral side 23 and medial side 22 are associated with an article of footwear 22 having a B width, then increasing the width of the upper 23 by moving the adjacent opening 72 on one side or the other to that position will provide a C width, and moving the other adjacent opening 72 on the opposite side in like manner will provide a D width. It is generally advantageous to configure an upper 23 having only two alternate openings 72 for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used in accordance with the width sizing model shown in FIG. 32.
 FIG. 32 shows an article of footwear 22 which is adjustable along the entire length of the upper 23 including the forefoot area 58, midfoot area 67, and rearfoot area 68 having two alternate openings 72 for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used, and the possible use of local reinforcement material 81 in the area about the openings 72. The reinforcement material 81 can be made of tape, textile, plastic, natural or synthetic rubber, natural or synthetic leather, metal, or other robust material which serves to enhance the strength of the upper 23. The reinforcement material 81 can also be tactified, or otherwise possess relatively high static and dynamic coefficients of friction, and can possibly include a self-adhesive material 83. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous that the self-adhesive material 83 have a repeatable or renewable adhesion and release capability. Also shown is the use of a t-sock 56 made of stretchlastic material that has greater than 100 percent elongation which can easily accommodate the possible Â½ inch width expansion of the upper 23.
 FIG. 33 shows a bottom view of the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 of an article of footwear generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 30 and 31, but including three alternate openings 72 for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used. In the American sizing system, a change in length by one size corresponds to â inch, and changes in width as between respective sizes A, B, C, D, and E are associated with increments of Â¼ inch. Further, the increments in length and width associated with other sizing systems are also known. Given an upper 23 having three alternate openings 72 that are separated by Â¼ inch for possible use at each fastener 29 position, and in particular, about the forefoot area 58, it is possible for the article of footwear 22 to provide five possible width size options such as width sizes A, B, C, D, and E. For example, if the openings 72 closest to the lateral side 23 and medial side 22 are associated with an article of footwear 22 having a size A width, then increasing the width of the upper 23 by moving the next adjacent opening 72 on one side or the other to that position will provide a B width, and moving the other adjacent opening 72 on the opposite side will provide a C width, and so on, thus possibly also providing size D and E widths, as desired. It can be advantageous to configure an upper 23 having three alternate openings 72 for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used in accordance with the width sizing model shown in FIG. 34.
 FIG. 34 shows an upper 23 having three alternate openings 72 for possible use at each different position at which a fastener 29 can be used, and also the possible use of reinforcement material 81 in the area about and between the openings 72. This reinforcement material 81 can be made of tape, textile, plastic, natural or synthetic rubber, natural or synthetic leather, metal, or other robust material that will serve to enhance the strength of the upper 23. The reinforcement material 81 can also be tactified, or otherwise possess a relatively high static and dynamic coefficient of friction, and can possibly include a self-adhesive material 83. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous that the self-adhesive material 83 have a repeatable or renewable adhesion and release capability. Also shown is the use of a t-sock 56 made of stretchlastic material that has greater than 100 percent elongation which can easily accommodate the possible 1 inch width expansion of the upper 23.
 FIG. 35 shows a lasting board 79 for the forefoot area 58 including a plurality of openings 72, or alternately, a plurality of indications with respect to making a plurality of openings 72 for use in the present invention. These openings 72 can provide alternate positions for use in affixing portions of the upper 23 in functional relation to the lasting board 79 with the use of fasteners 29. Also shown is the use of a code for indicating each different position where a fastener 29 can be used, and also the three alternative openings 72 for possible use at each different position. The same code can also be used with corresponding parts of the upper 23 and sole 32. Accordingly, the information and intelligence created from the raw data which has been collected with respect to an individual wearer or target population can indicate the selection of a specific lasting board 79 and also a specific code indicating the openings 72 to be used in order to provide an individual wearer or target population with an optimal or preferred custom fit. For example, various lasting boards 79 having a particular size length, foot shape configuration, and size width can be given numerical and/or alphabetical identification. Further, the various different positions at which a fastener 29 can be used, and in particular, the alternate openings 72 which are present at each different position can be given an alphabetical and/or numerical identification, as shown in FIG. 35.
Accordingly, the raw data or feedback provided by an individual when transformed into information and intelligence could possibly indicate the selection a lasting board 79 having American length size 11, last or foot shape number 3 from amongst a possible selection of thirty different last or foot shape configurations, and also indicate selection of the following code with respect to utilization of the various different positions and alternate openings 72: Code 1.1/2.2/3.2/4.2/5.2/6.1/7.2/8.2. In contrast, an different individual could require the same lasting board 79 having American length size 11, last or foot shape number 3, but a different code for optimal utilization of the various different positions and alternate openings 72, e.g., Code 1.2/2.1/3.1/4.2/5.3/6.1/7.2/8.2. Obviously, a different individual could require a lasting board 79 having a different length and also a different last or foot shape, and the data and preferences of different individuals can also indicate or result in the selection of different uppers 23 having different functions, designs, styles, materials, and sizes.
 FIG. 36 shows an alternate lasting board 79 or spring element 51 for use in the forefoot area 58 of an article of footwear 22. The spring element 51 consists of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which includes a longitudinal slit 82 that at least partially separates the medial side 35 from the lateral side 36 and permits somewhat independent articulation and flexion of these two portions. It can be advantageous for the position of the longitudinal slit 82 to coincide with the space between an wearer's first and second toes and corresponding metatarsals, or alternately, with the space between an wearer's second and third toes and corresponding metatarsals. This can facilitate independent articulation of the toes and metatarsals of the foot and possibly enhance both comfort and athletic performance. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,973 granted to the present inventor and assigned to Nike, Inc., previously incorporated by reference herein. The physical and mechanical properties of the anterior spring element 48 can be varied as between its anterior side and posterior side, but also as between its medial side 35 and lateral side 36.
A lasting board 79 or spring element 51 component having a given size length can also sometimes be used with articles of footwear 22 which are in the range between one to three different half sizes longer and shorter. As shown in FIG. 36, at least one alternate set of openings 72 can be included on the posterior spring element 49 for affixing the posterior spring element 49 in functional relation to the anterior spring element 48. Further, an alternate set of openings 72 can be included on the anterior spring element 48 for the same purpose. In the American sizing system, length changes of one full size approximately correspond to increments of ârd of an inch, and the distances associated with other sizing systems are also known. Accordingly, two sets of alternate openings 72 spaced apart by a distance corresponding to a full size length can sometimes render a lasting board 79 or spring element 51 suitable for use with three or four sizes.
 FIG. 37 shows a different alternate lasting board 79 or spring element 51 including an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49. The anterior spring element 48 for use in the forefoot area 58 of an article of footwear 22 consists of two separate parts, that is, a medial anterior spring element 78, and lateral anterior spring element 77. This configuration separates the medial side 35 from the lateral side 36 and permits substantial independent articulation and flexion of these two parts. It can be advantageous for the position of the longitudinal opening 72 between the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 to coincide with the space between an wearer's first and second toes and corresponding metatarsals, or alternately, with the space between an wearer's second and third toes and corresponding metatarsals. This can facilitate independent articulation of the toes and metatarsals of the foot and possibly enhance both comfort and athletic performance. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,973 granted to the present inventor and assigned to Nike, Inc., previously incorporated by reference herein. The physical and mechanical properties of the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 can be varied as between their respective anterior sides and posterior sides, but also as between their respective medial sides 35 and lateral sides 36. Further, the configuration and also the physical and mechanical properties of the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 can be different from one another. In addition, different medial anterior spring elements 78 and lateral anterior spring elements 77 can be selected for use in an article of footwear 22. Also shown in FIG. 37 is the possible use of a plurality of different alternate openings 72 for affixing the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 in different relative positions. Given American footwear sizing, if the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 are configured to provide a size B width when the two parts are in a closed position, that is, the two parts are adjacent to one another, then moving one of the parts Â¼ inch will provide a size C width, and moving the other part Â¼ inch will provide a D width, and the two parts will then be separated by Â½ inch. If the medial anterior spring element 78 and lateral anterior spring element 77 are configured to provide a size A width when the two parts are in a closed position, that is, the two parts are adjacent to one another, then moving one of the parts Â¼ inch will provide a size B width, and moving the other part Â¼ inch will provide a C width, and so on, such that when providing an E width the two parts will be separated by one inch. The position of any potential openings 72 corresponding to half or whole size increments associated with a given sizing system which are to be made in portions of a lasting board 79, spring element 51, upper 23, or sole 32, can be indicated upon any or all of the components, or alternately, the various openings 72 can be made in stock parts intended for future use. Further, it can be readily understood that the openings 72 and any other adjustments which are made to various components of a customized article of footwear 22 can be unique to an individual wearer.
 FIG. 38 is a transverse and exploded cross-sectional view taken along line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an alternate article of footwear 22 showing a lasting board 79 or spring element 51 having male mechanical engagement means affixed thereto, and also an upper 23, insole 31, sole 32, and female mechanical engagement means for engaging in functional relation with the male mechanical engagement means. The male and female mechanical engagement means can consist of fasteners 29 have a male part 85 and a female part 86. Alternately, the male part 85 can be affixed to the sole 32, or the fasteners 29 can consist of loose parts. The fasteners 29 shown on the left in FIG. 38 can be visible on the inferior side 38 of the sole 32. Alternately, a fastener 29 can include a male part 85 or female part 86 which is affixed within the sole 32, and the corresponding mating part can be inserted and affixed in functional relation from the superior side within the defined space of the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22, as shown on the right in FIG. 43. Alternately, as shown on the right in FIG. 38, the fasteners 29 can include a resilient material suitable for use on the sole 32 or outsole 43 such that the fasteners 29 are hardly visible and their use does not appreciably degrade the cushioning or traction provided by the sole 32 or outsole 43. Alternately, a fastener 29 including a resilient material or other material can project from the surface of the sole and form a traction member, lug, or cleat, as shown in FIG. 23. Accordingly, an article of footwear 22 including a lasting board 79 or spring element 51 can include the structure disclosed in the specification and shown in the drawing figures of U.S. Pat. No. 6,954,998 B1 by Michel Lussier, and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/064,439 by Wolfgang Scholtz assigned to Adidas International Marketing B.V., both of these patent documents hereby incorporated by reference herein. Moreover, an article of footwear 22 can include the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,948,264 by the applicant, and also U.S. Pat. No. 5,832,636 by Robert Lyden and Souheng Wu, assigned to Nike, Inc., both of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
 FIG. 39 is a transverse cross-sectional view taken at a position consistent with line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an alternate article of footwear 22 showing an insole 31 overlapping the superior side 38, medial side 35, lateral side 36, and a portion of the inferior side 38 of a lasting board 79 or spring element 51. The insole 31 can include a stock fit recess 84 for receiving the lasting board 79 or spring element 51. The insole 31 can be affixed by adhesive or overmolded to the lasting board 79 or spring element 51. Alternately, a portion of the insole 31 can be trapped between the inferior side 38 of the lasting board 79 or spring element 51 and the upper 23 when the article of footwear 32 is assembled, as shown in FIG. 39. This configuration can also serve to protect and cushion the edges of the lasting board 79 or spring element 51.
 FIG. 40 is a cross-sectional view taken at a position consistent with line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an alternate article of footwear 22 showing a portion of the sole 32 or outsole 43 overlapping the inferior side 38, medial side 35, lateral side 36, and a portion to the superior side 37 of a lasting board 79 or spring element 51. This configuration serves to cover and protect the sides of the spring element 51. The spring element 51 and outsole 43 can be affixed to the upper 23 using a separate lasting board 79 positioned within the upper 23 and secured with fasteners 29. Alternately, a backing 30 can be used and take the position of the spring element 51, and the spring element 51 can be used and take the position of the lasting board 79, that is, the spring element 51 can simultaneously serve as the lasting board 79, as previously discussed.
 FIG. 41 is a transverse cross-sectional view taken at a position consistent with line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an alternate article of footwear 22 showing a separate lasting board 79 and a spring element 51, and also an upper 23, insole 31, and outsole 43. In this alternate embodiment of an article footwear 22, the outsole 43 can cover, be affixed, bonded, or over-molded to the spring element 51. The spring element 51 can be completely covered by the outsole 43 on the inferior side 38, or alternately, portions of the spring element 51 can be visible and exposed.
 FIG. 42 is a transverse cross-sectional view taken at a position consistent with line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an article of footwear 22 showing a sole 32 or outsole 43 that is directly affixed and integral to the upper 23, and also a lasting board 79 or spring element 51, and an insole 31. The upper 23 can be made at least in part of a synthetic textile or leather made of a thermoplastic material, and the sole 32 can be made of the same type of thermoplastic material, or alternately, a different material which can be bonded to the upper 23. For example, a polyurethane material can be used for this purpose. The sole 32 can be affixed or overmolded onto the upper 23 by direct injection method. The direct injection process can be performed upon a substantially finished upper 23 into which a last 80 has been inserted, or upon an unfinished upper 23 which still has a relatively flat configuration and the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22 can then be completed using a three dimensional stitching process.
 FIG. 43 is a transverse cross-sectional view taken along a position consistent with line 38-38 in FIG. 16 of an alternate article of footwear 22 showing a sole 32 directly affixed to an upper 23, an insole 31, and also a lasting board 79 or spring element 51 located within a recess 84. The contours associated with the recess 84 can provide a mechanical interlock between the upper 23, spring element 51, and backing 30 of the sole 32 or outsole 43. As shown in FIG. 43, the lasting board 79 or spring element 51 does not extend to the perimeter of the upper 23 or sole 32, and this can reduce the stiffness exhibited at the perimeter or edge of the sole 32, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,004 granted to the present inventor, and assigned to Nike, Inc., hereby incorporated by reference herein. It can be advantageous in an article of footwear 22 intended for use in running to extend the lasting board 79 or spring element 51 to the perimeter or edge of the sole 32 in those areas which are shown in dark shading in FIG. 24 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,004, but not to the perimeter or edge of the sole 32 in those areas which are not shaded. Accordingly, in the transverse cross-sectional view shown in FIG. 43, it can be advantageous to extend the lasting board 79 or spring element 51 to the perimeter or edge of the sole 32 on the medial side 35, but not on the lateral side 36. The sole 32 can be removably affixed to the upper 23 with the use of fasteners 29, and the like. As shown on the right in FIG. 43, a fastener 29 can include a male part 85 or female part 86 which is affixed within the sole 32, and the corresponding mating part can be inserted and affixed in functional relation from the superior side within the defined space of the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22. Alternately, the sole 32 can be permanently affixed to the upper 23 with the use of adhesives, or overmolded by direct injection process.
 FIG. 44 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 comprising a sandal which includes a spring element 51. Again, a spring element 51 can include an anterior spring element 48, a posterior spring element 49, and an inferior spring element 50 affixed together in functional relation. It can be readily understood that a plurality of different designs and configurations are possible with respect to the upper 23 of a preferred sandal. A sandal according to the present invention can be designed for high fashion, or alternately, for hiking and recreational use, as shown in FIG. 44. Further, the various components of a sandal can be affixed together with adhesive, or alternately, can be selectively and removably replaced with the use of mechanical engagement means including but not limited to fasteners 29, and the like.
The present invention teaches and makes possible not only a novel method of manufacturing articles of footwear, but also, a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business. The configuration and dimensions of a given wearer's foot and any other special needs and requirements or wearer preferences can be recorded by direct observation and measurement in a retail or medical setting, or by a wearer or other individual at their home or other remote site, and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to the manufacture of an appropriate custom article of footwear for the wearer and intended end use. This information and intelligence relating to an individual wearer or target population can include a so-called soft virtual model that is created and maintained in computer software or other data storage and retrieval system for present and future use.
Conventional measuring or reproduction means including but not limited to rulers, measuring tapes, Brannock devices, two or three dimensional scanners, pressure sensors, infrared thermography, stereolithography, paper, photographs, photocopies, cameras, images, tracings, video, verbal communication, telephone, television, FAX, computers and computer screens, software, data storage and retrieval systems, e-mail, lasts, lasting boards, templates, molds, models, and patterns can be used, as well as other tangible mediums of expression, and the like. Some of the data which might be collected could include, but not be limited to an individual's: foot length; foot width at one or more locations; foot girth at one or more locations; arch characteristics such as high arch, normal arch, or low arch; the presence of a varus or valgus condition; bunions; Morton's toe; two dimensional foot shape; three dimensional foot shape; data collected using F-scan equipment and software made by Tekscan, Inc. of Boston, Mass.; strike index, plantar pressure, and center of pressure data collected using Pedar or Emed equipment made by Novel Electronics, Inc. of St. Paul, Minn.; digital photographs or video images showing superior, inferior, anterior, medial, lateral, and perspective views of an individual's foot; video data collected of an individual while in motion using digital cameras; biomechanical analysis of an individual's motion such as rearfoot motion analysis, and possibly including top, bottom, side, frontal, rear, and perspective view using equipment and software made by manufacturers such as Mikromak GmbH, of Erlangen, Germany, Northern Digital of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Motion Analysis of Santa Rosa, Calif., VICON Motion Systems of Lake Forest, Calif., or Peak Performance Technologies, Inc., of Englewood, Colo.; and, the individuals name; mailing and e-mail address; password, phone number; sex; weight; age; training age; walking or running pace; fit preference such as loose, normal, or tight; activity preference; affiliation; sizing system preference such as inches or metric; place of payment such as zip code or city; method of payment such as cash, check, debit card, credit card, and including the relevant account number and expiration date.
Given this collected raw data, information and intelligence can then be created including an individual record which could include a virtual model of an individual's feet. This information and intelligence can be used to select one or more options with respect to a footwear last, or other footwear configuration including length size, width, and girth measurements. Accordingly, this information and intelligence can be used to identify specific categories and footwear models for consideration. If and when working in a computer environment, the various options can be displayed for consideration and selection. This can be done with the use of a wireless computer or cell phone. Further, an individual can then click on various categories or models in order to receive additional technical information and also pricing information. In addition, an individual can then click on various segments or components of a virtual model or article of footwear being presented, and so access more specific menus relating to selections which can be made according to their preference with respect to the structure, function, material, color, and design of a given component. Accordingly, an individual can make a final and confirmed selection.
Given the collected data, the information and intelligence created, and a ready and adequate stock of the various components anticipated for use in making articles of footwear, an individual customer, or alternately, a worker in a retail, medical, manufacturing, or distribution center which possibly includes an automated system including robotics can gather the required components for assembly. An individual can then purchase the required components and assemble the article of footwear themselves. Alternately, the article of footwear can be manufactured or assembled by a worker in a retail, medical, manufacturing, or distribution center. In any case, a custom article of footwear can be manufactured and assembled within thirty minutes, and in some cases even in less than one minute.
For example, selections can be made from a ready stock of different uppers 23, lasting boards 79, spring elements 51 and related sub-component parts, insoles 31, and sole 32 components possibly including midsoles 26, and outsoles 43, having different configurations and dimensions corresponding to a selected article of footwear 22, and the resulting custom article of footwear 22 can be rapidly made or assembled, as desired. If desired, a substantial portion of an article of footwear 22, that is, greater than fifty percent, and preferably greater than seventy-five percent, and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper 23 to make a custom article of footwear 22 within minutes. Again, this task can be performed by the customer, or a service provider at the point of purchase in a retail setting or medical facility. Accordingly, similar to the rapid delivery eyewear retail stores and service centers that presently exist, a customer can now also be provided with a custom article of footwear within minutes.

 FIG. 45 is a medial cross-sectional side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having outsole 43 portions affixed directly to the superior spring element 47 in the forefoot area 58 and/or midfoot area 67. Again, the superior spring element 47 can be made of a fiber composite material such as carbon fiber composite or a metal material such as titanium. The outsole 43 portions in the forefoot area 58 and also the midfoot area 67 can be affixed directly to the superior spring element 47 by conventional adhesives, and alternately, by self-adhesive means, or mechanical means. As shown in FIG. 47, the upper 23 includes a plurality of openings 72 for accommodating the outsole 43 portions, thus when the superior spring element 47 including the outsole 43 portions is inserted into the upper 23 the outsole 43 portions pass through the plurality of openings 72 as the superior spring element 47 is placed into proper position. An insole 31 can then be inserted into the upper 23, and the article of footwear 22 can then be donned by a wearer. Alternately, the insole 31 can also be affixed to the superior spring element 47 and inserted into the upper 23 as a single unit. Further, a portion of the anterior side 33 of the superior spring element 47 can be inserted into a sleeve 39 of the upper 23 and thereby be retained in position, as discussed and shown in connection with FIG. 15. Moreover, a part including backing 30, or alternately, an anterior spring element 48.1 including a portion of the outsole 43 can be used near the anterior side 33 of the forefoot area 58, and be affixed with the use of mechanical engagement means including male and female parts, e.g., at least one hook 27 and opening 72, and/or a fastener 29, as shown in FIG. 46. The inferior portion of the upper 23 can be made of a strong and long wearing textile material such as KEVLARÂ®, or a NYLCOÂ® ballistic multi-ply fabric such as âN-915Wâ having a protective polyurethane face coating distributed by Worthen Industries, Inc., of 3 East Spit Brook Road, Nashua N.H., and 530 Main Street, Clinton, Mass. These fabric materials can be hand cut, die cut, laser cut, or cut using other conventional means including the possible use of an automatic cutting table.
 FIG. 46 is a medial cross-sectional side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having outsole portions 43 affixed directly to the superior spring element 47 in the forefoot area 58, and further including a supplemental posterior spring element 49.1 in the rearfoot area 68. The addition of a supplemental posterior spring element 49.1 which can be selected from a range of alternate posterior spring elements 49.1 having different thickness or shapes enables the stiffness and mechanical properties of the superior spring element 47 in the rearfoot area 68 to be easily changed and customized. The possible greater relative thickness of the superior spring element 47 in combination with the supplemental posterior spring element 49.1 can be accommodated by stock-fitting it in the inferior portion of the insole 31, and by engineering the approximate thickness into the desired forefoot versus heel elevation differential. Also shown in FIG. 46 is the use of a part including backing 30, or alternately, an anterior spring element 48.1 including a portion of the outsole 43 near the anterior side 33 of the forefoot area 58. When affixed in position the backing 30, or alternately, an anterior spring element 48.1 thereby traps a portion of the upper 23 between the backing 30 or anterior spring element 48.1 and superior spring element 47. The backing 30, or alternately, an anterior spring element 48.1 can be affixed with the use of mechanical engagement means including male and female parts, e.g., at least one hook 27 and opening 72, and/or a fastener 29, as shown in FIG. 46. The fasteners 29 can be visible from the bottom side as shown in the forefoot area 58, or alternately not be visible, as shown in the rearfoot area 68 in FIG. 46.
 FIG. 47 is a bottom view of the alternate article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 45 having outsole 43 portions affixed directly to the superior spring element 47 in the forefoot area 58 and midfoot area 67. As shown in FIG. 47, the outsole 43 portions pass through openings 72 in the inferior side 38 of the upper 23. The portions of the upper 23 about the openings 72 can form relatively narrow links or bridges 97 connecting the opposing sides of the upper 23, thus still substantially maintain the shape, and integrity of upper 23. A wide variety of structures and patterns can be used regarding the bridges 97 formed on the inferior side 38 of the upper 23. Shown in the rearfoot area 68 is inferior spring element 50 including posterior outsole element 46, a single fastener 29, and a locating pin 96. The locating pin 96 can be affixed to the inferior spring element 50, or alternately to the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 and be configured for passing through corresponding mating openings 72 in the various sub-components of the spring element 51. Further, the fastener 29 can be a loose part, or alternately can be affixed to one of the various sub-components of the spring element 51. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 101, the fastener 29 and/or locating pin 96 can have a round transverse cross-section, but at least one of these components preferably has a more complex geometric shape when viewed in a transverse cross-section, such as square, rectangle, pentagon, octagon, or star shape. Accordingly, the insertion of the fastener 29 and/or locating pin 96 can serve to lock the various sub-components of the spring element 50 into a specific geometric orientation so that they cannot be caused to shift or freely rotate about the axis of the fastener 29 and/or locating pin 96 when the sub-components are properly affixed in place.
 FIG. 48 is a medial cross-sectional side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having outsole 43 portions affixed directly to an anterior spring element 48.1 in the forefoot area 58. Like the embodiment shown in FIG. 16, the superior spring element 47 is affixed to the anterior spring element 48.1 by fasteners 29 thereby trapping and firmly securing an inferior portion of the upper 23 therebetween. However, the use of a single fastener 29 for securing the inferior spring element 50 and numerous gaps 98 between portions of the anterior outsole element 44 are shown in FIG. 48.
 FIG. 49 is a medial cross-sectional side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 having outsole 43 portions affixed directly to an anterior spring element 48.2 in the forefoot area 58 which is affixed to an anterior spacer 55.2 and the superior spring element 47. Again, the shape and thickness of an anterior spacer 55.2 in various locations can be varied so as to create a sloped shape, or other complex shapes along the longitudinal axis 69 or transverse axis 91 of the article of footwear 22. This can determine the relative position of the fulcrum created by the anterior spacer 55.2, but also the angular inclination, magnitude of deflection, and exhibited stiffness of the anterior spring element 48.2. As shown in FIG. 235, the inferior spring element 50 has a flexural axis 59 which is generally transverse to the longitudinal axis 69. Alternately, an inferior spring element 50 having a flexural axis 59 that is diagonal with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 could be used. In addition, as shown in FIG. 100, a midsole element 26 including a fluid-filled bladder can be employed in the space between the anterior spring element 48.2 and the inferior portion of the upper 23. When a gas-filled bladder is used, the gas contained within the bladder can be at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, be pressurized above atmospheric pressure.

 FIG. 65 is a bottom plan view of a spring element including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having a notch 71 and a longitudinal slit 82. As shown, the longitudinal slit 82 partially bisects the inferior spring element 50. When an article of footwear 22 including the inferior spring element 50 is loaded near the lateral posterior corner the stiffness in bending is reduced relative to an otherwise similar inferior spring element 50 which does not include the longitudinal slit 82. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 66 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element consisting of two separate portions 50.1 and 50.2. The configuration and physical properties of each portion 50.1 and 50.2 can thereby be individually varied and customized for optimal performance.
 FIG. 67 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having a notch 71 and diagonal slit 82 that starting on the medial side 35 partially traverses the inferior spring element 50. The diagonal slit 82 creates a line of flexion 54 that reduces the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 at the lateral posterior corner. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 68 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having two notches 71. The two notches 71 approximately oppose one another forming a line of flexion 54 that is diagonal with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 of the inferior spring element 50. The diagonal line of flexion 54 reduces the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 at the lateral posterior corner. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 69 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having a slit 82. The slit 82 forms a line of flexion 54 that is diagonal with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 of the inferior spring element 50. The diagonal line of flexion 54 reduces the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 at the lateral posterior corner. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 70 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having an opening 72. The opening 72 can be circular or oval shaped and is centrally positioned under the weight bearing center of a wearer's heel 57. The presence of opening 72 will decrease the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and including the exhibited torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 71 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having an opening 72. The opening 72 is asymmetrical and elongated such as to reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 of the line of flexion 54 created thereby. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 72 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having an opening 72. The opening 72 is asymmetrical and elongated such as to reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 of the line of flexion 54 created thereby. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 73 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a midsole 26 cushioning element and an inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element can include or substantially consist of a fluid-filled bladder 101. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure.

In particular, fluid-filled bladders including valves that can provide a motion control device such as taught in the above recited patent application WO 01/70061 A2, and fluid-filled bladders comprising a dynamically-controlled cushioning system, as taught in the above recited patent application WO 01/78539 A2, can be used. In the latter case, an article of footwear can include at least one fluid-filled bladder including a plurality of chambers, a control system possibly including a CPU, a pressure detector, and a regulator for modulating the level of fluid communication between different fluid-filled bladders or chambers. It can be readily understood that the fluid-filled bladders taught in the recited patents and patent applications, and the like, could be used in combination with a spring element 51, e.g., various alternate embodiments shown in FIGS. 73-82, 96-100, and 115-117.
Alternately, a midsole 26 cushioning element can also be made of a foam rubber or plastic material such as polyurethane or ethylene vinyl acetate. In addition, the midsole 26 can simultaneously comprise a posterior spacer 42. As shown in FIG. 73, a midsole 26 cushioning element can occupy substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59. Alternately, a midsole 26 cushioning element can occupy a portion of the space, area, and volume between a superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50, as shown, e.g., in FIGS. 74-82, 96-98, 118-120, and the like.
 FIG. 74 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a midsole 26 cushioning element and an inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a fluid-filled bladder 101. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a foam rubber or plastic material such as polyurethane or ethylene vinyl acetate. In addition, the midsole 26 can simultaneously comprise a posterior spacer 42. The termination of the midsole 26 at the relatively linear line of flexion 54 which is diagonal with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 creates an additional fulcrum associated with bending of the inferior spring element 50. As shown in FIG. 74, the midsole 26 encompasses substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59 and anterior of the line of flexion 54. The flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 and posterior of the line of flexion 54 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 75 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a midsole 26 cushioning element and an inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a fluid-filled bladder 101. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a foam rubber or plastic material such as polyurethane or ethylene vinyl acetate. In addition, the midsole 26 can simultaneously comprise a posterior spacer 42. The termination of the midsole 26 at the arcuate line of flexion 54 creates an additional fulcrum associated with bending of the inferior spring element 50. As shown in FIG. 74, the midsole 26 encompasses substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59 and anterior of the arcuate line of flexion 54. The flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 and posterior of the line of flexion 54 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 76 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a midsole 26 cushioning element and an inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a fluid-filled bladder 101. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be made of a foam rubber or plastic material such as polyurethane or ethylene vinyl acetate. In addition, the midsole 26 can simultaneously comprise a posterior spacer 42. The termination of the midsole 26 at the arcuate line of flexion 54 creates an additional fulcrum associated with bending of the inferior spring element 50. As shown in FIG. 74, the midsole 26 encompasses substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59 and anterior of the arcuate line of flexion 54. The flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 and posterior of the line of flexion 54 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 77 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a column shaped midsole 26 cushioning element and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or a foam material. As shown, the single midsole 26 cushioning element has an oval or elliptical shape in a top plan view. However, it can be readily understood that a single midsole 26 cushioning element can have other geometric shapes. As shown, the midsole 26 cushioning element is located on the medial side 35. The relative flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 78 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal two column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or a foam material. As shown, the two midsole 26 cushioning elements have a circular shape in a top plan view. However, it can be readily understood that the two midsole 26 cushioning elements can have other geometric shapes. As shown, the midsole 26 cushioning elements are located on the medial side 35. The relative flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 79 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal three column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or a foam material. As shown, the three midsole 26 cushioning elements have a circular shape in a top plan view. However, it can be readily understood that the three midsole 26 cushioning elements can have other geometric shapes. As shown, the midsole 26 cushioning elements are located on the medial side 35. The relative flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 80 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal six column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or a foam material. As shown, the column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements are symmetrically positioned on both the medial side 35 and lateral side 36, and the midsole 26 cushioning elements have a circular shape in a top plan view. However, it can be readily understood that the midsole 26 cushioning elements can have other geometric shapes. If desired, at least the posteriormost midsole 26 cushioning element on the lateral side 36 can be made of a composition as to exhibit less stiffness in compression than those on the medial side 35. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 81 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal five column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or a foam material. The midsole 26 cushioning elements have a circular shape in a top plan view. However, it can be readily understood that the midsole 26 cushioning elements can have other geometric shapes. As shown, three of the column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements are positioned on the medial side 35 and two of the column shaped midsole 26 cushioning elements are positioned on the lateral side 36. The relative flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 82 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal a midsole 26 cushioning element including an opening 72 and an inferior spring element 50. Again, a midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a fluid-filled bladder, or alternately and as shown in FIG. 82, the midsole 26 cushioning element can consist of a foam material. As shown, the midsole 26 cushioning element encompasses a significant portion of the space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59. However, the void space or opening 72 is asymmetrically positioned closer to the lateral side 36 than the medial side 35, thus the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the lateral side 36 can thereby be decreased. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 83 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal an inferior spring element 50 having convex peak 92 portions and concave valley 93 portions extending longitudinally on the medial side. The presence of convex peak 92 portions and concave valley 93 portions can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 84 is a cross-sectional view along line 84-84 of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 83 having convex peak 92 portions and concave valley 93 portions.
 FIG. 85 is a cross-sectional view similar to that shown in FIG. 84 of an alternate inferior spring element 50 having an extension 94 on the medial side 35. As shown, the extension 94 projects both above and below the two planes formed by the superior side 37 and inferior side 38 of the inferior spring element 50. The presence of an extension 94 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 86 is a cross-sectional view similar to that shown in FIG. 84 of an alternate inferior spring element 50 having an extension 94 on the medial side 35. As shown, the extension 94 projects above the plane formed by the superior side 37 of the inferior spring element 50. The presence of an extension 94 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 87 is a cross-sectional view similar to that shown in FIG. 84 of an alternate inferior spring element 50 having an extension 94 on the medial side 35. As shown, the extension 94 projects below the plane formed by the inferior side 38 of the inferior spring element 50. The presence of an extension 94 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 88 is a cross-sectional view similar to that shown in FIG. 84 of an alternate inferior spring element 50 having concave peaks 92 and convex valleys 93 on the superior side 37. The presence of convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 89 is a cross-sectional view similar to that shown in FIG. 84 of an alternate inferior spring element 50 having greater thickness on the medial side 35. The presence of greater thickness can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 90 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 with parts broken away posterior of the flexural axis 59 in order to reveal an inferior spring element 50 having convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93 extending transversely from the medial side 35. The presence of convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 91 is a side view of a spring element 51 similar to that shown in FIG. 90 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 including inserts 95 such as dowels and convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93. An insert 95 can consist of a relatively light-weight material which can create or quickly build a desired generally planar thickness or convex peak 92 when substantially encapsulated by a fiber composite material. The presence of convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 92 is a side view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 including convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93.
The presence of convex peaks 92 and concave valleys 93 can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending, and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 93 is a top perspective view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 showing a cross-section taken along line 94-94. The inferior spring element 50 can be affixed to the superior spring element 47 at one or more locations proximate its anterior side, and the inferior spring element 50 can then gradually and evenly project downwards from the superior spring element 47 on the medial side 35 and lateral side 36. Accordingly, the configuration and relationship between the inferior spring element 50 and superior spring element 47 can appear as shown in the transverse cross-sectional view shown in FIG. 94.
 FIG. 94 is a cross-sectional view of the spring element 51 shown in FIG. 93 taken along line 94-94.
 FIG. 95 is a transverse cross-sectional view of an alternate spring element 51 taken along a line similar to 94-94 shown in FIG. 93. Again, the inferior spring element 50 can be affixed to the superior spring element 47 at one or more locations near its anterior side. However, the inferior spring element 50 projects downwards from the superior spring element 47 on the medial side 35 unevenly relative to the lateral side 36. Accordingly, the configuration and relationship between the inferior spring element 50 and superior spring element 47 can appear as shown in the transverse cross-sectional view shown in FIG. 95. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 is sloped upwards from the lateral side 36 to the medial side 35. Accordingly, when the inferior spring element 50 is loaded at the lateral and posterior corner during the walking or running gait cycle, the inferior spring element 50 can exhibit greater counter-clockwise movement and torsional stiffness. In particular, when the inferior spring element 50 is affixed near its anterior end at a single and central location, the medial side 35 of the inferior spring element 50 can move counter-clockwise and exert force upon the support surface thereby actively posting and supporting the medial side 35.
 FIG. 96 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 cushioning element affixed to both the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be affixed only to the superior spring element 47, or alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can only be affixed to the inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element shown in FIG. 96 can generally resemble that shown in FIG. 77.
 FIG. 97 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including two midsole 26 cushioning elements affixed to the superior spring element 47. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be affixed only to the inferior spring element 50, or alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be affixed to both the inferior spring element 50 and superior spring element 47. The midsole 26 cushioning element shown in FIG. 97 can generally resemble those shown in FIG. 78.
 FIG. 98 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including three midsole 26 cushioning elements affixed to the inferior spring element 50. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be affixed only to the superior spring element 47, or alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning element can be affixed to both the inferior spring element 50 and superior spring element 47. The midsole 26 cushioning elements shown in FIG. 98 can generally resemble those shown in FIGS. 79, 80, 81. In addition, the height of the various midsole 26 cushioning elements can be the same, or alternately, the height of the midsole 26 cushioning elements can vary, thus introducing both a fulcrum and a distinct change in the exhibited stiffness of the spring element 51 in various stages. Accordingly, one or more of the midsole 26 cushioning elements can be loaded at the same time, or at different times during the gait cycle. As a result, the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear 22 can be reduced.
 FIG. 99 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 cushioning element comprising a fluid-filled bladder affixed between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50. The midsole 26 cushioning element comprising a fluid-filled bladder 101 can generally resemble that shown in FIG. 73. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure. As shown in FIG. 73, the midsole 26 encompasses substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59. However, the midsole 26 can encompass a portion of the space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59, as shown in FIGS. 74-82, and many other configurations are possible.
 FIG. 100 is a longitudinal cross-sectional medial side view of an alternate article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 cushioning element comprising a first posterior fluid-filled bladder 101.1 affixed between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 in the rearfoot area 68, and a second anterior fluid-filled bladder 101.2 affixed between the superior spring element 47 and an inferior anterior spring element 48.2 in the forefoot area 58. The alternate article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 100 can be generally similar to that shown in FIG. 49, but with the addition of fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder can contain a gas, liquid, or viscous material pressurized at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately, above atmospheric pressure. As shown in FIG. 100, the midsole 26 cushioning elements encompass substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 posterior of the flexural axis 59, but also substantially the entire space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior anterior spring element 48.2 posterior of the anterior position of attachment behind the anterior spacer 55.2. Alternately, the midsole 26 cushioning elements can encompass only a portion of the space, area, and volume between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50, and/or the superior spring element 47 and the inferior anterior spring element 48.2, thus many other configurations are possible.
 FIG. 101 is a perspective exploded view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47, and an inferior spring element 50 showing a fastener 29 and a locating pin 96. The superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50 can both include registered openings 72 having a shape such as a square, rectangle, diamond, triangle, pentagon, octagon, star, or other non-circular complex shape which can thereby be mechanically engaged and locked in position with respect to the fastener 29. In addition, a locating pin 96 can also be used to align and maintain the superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50 in proper position. The locating pin 96 can possibly be affixed to either the superior spring element 47 or inferior spring element 50, and can possibly pass through the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 before engaging a corresponding component of the spring element 51.
 FIG. 102 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 51 and an inferior spring element 50 having an insert 95. The insert 95 can be made of metal such as titanium or spring steel and can serve to increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and also the torsional stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to more substantial use of a fiber composite material 102 on the lateral side 36. The insert 95 can be partially or completely encapsulated by a fiber composite material 102.
 FIG. 103 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having a different fiber composite material 102.1 on the medial side 35 than the fiber composite material 102.2 used on the lateral side 36. For example, a uni-directional carbon fiber composite material 102.1 could be used on the medial side 35, whereas a woven carbon fiber composite material 102.2 could be used on the lateral side 36. This can serve to increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and also the torsional stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36.
 FIG. 104 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having different fiber composite materials on the medial side 35 than on the lateral side 36. For example, a uni-directional carbon fiber composite material could be used on the medial side 35, whereas a fiberglass material could be used on the lateral side 36. This can serve to increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and also the torsional stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36.
 FIG. 105 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having different fiber composite material 102 orientations on the medial side 35 than on the lateral side 36. For example, on the medial side 35, when an inferior spring element 50 substantially consisting of uni-directional carbon fiber composite material 102 is being constructed, the direction of the fibers in one layer can be orientated parallel with respect to the longitudinal axis 69 or at 0 degrees, and the next layer can be orientated at about 45 degrees to the right, and then the next layer at about 45 degrees to the left. This sequence can then be repeated until the part is constructed to the desired thickness. If desired, on the lateral side 36, a greater number of the layers can be orientated between 0 degrees and 45 or 90 degrees right, as opposed to 0 degrees and 45 or 90 degrees left, as this can reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the inferior spring element 50, since uni-directional carbon fiber composite materials normally exhibit greatest stiffness when bending at 90 degrees relative to the orientation of the fibers. This can serve to increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and also the torsional stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36, and create a line a flexion 54.
 FIG. 106 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having an uni-directional fiber composite material 102.1 orientated differently on the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34, than in the middle portion 105. In this alternate embodiment, the middle portion 105 can be constructed by alternating the orientation of the layers at 0 degrees, 45 degrees right, and 45 degrees left in a continuous sequences, whereas the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 can omit layers at 45 degrees left and right, and instead possibly use a greater number of layers at 0 degrees. The resulting inferior spring element 50 can exhibit less stiffness in bending at the medial, lateral, and posterior sides and edges than in the middle 105. This could be advantageous with regards to reducing the stiffness in bending even if not the actual length of the effective lever arm created by the sole of an associated article of footwear 22, thus reduce the magnitude of pronation or supination exhibited in certain lateral movement applications of the article of footwear such as tennis, volleyball, or basketball. However, a dramatic reduction in the stiffness of the sole about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior sides 34 can at some point prove counter-productive and result in instability, and so ideally, the stiffness variable should be optimized and customized for use by an individual wearer for use in the particular targeted activity.
 FIG. 107 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 made of a metal material. The metal material can substantially consist of a titanium alloy, or spring steel. The inferior spring element 50 can be cut and formed in a single part from a flat sheet stock of titanium alloy by bending the piece about the flexural axis 59, or alternately, the inferior spring element 50 can be stamped, forged, cast or molded into the desired shape.

The metal material can substantially consist of a titanium alloy, or spring steel. The spring element 51 can be cut and formed in a single part from a flat sheet stock of titanium alloy by bending the piece about a generally longitudinal flexural axis 59.1 on the medial side 35 and also about a generally longitudinal flexural axis 59.2 on the lateral side 36. Alternately, the inferior spring element 50 can be stamped, forged, cast or molded into the desired shape. The inferior spring element 50 can be have relatively greater separation from the superior spring element 47 near the posterior side 34 than near the anterior side 33.
 FIG. 110 is a cross-sectional view of the spring element 51 shown in FIG. 109 taken along line 110-110.
 FIG. 111 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 having a symmetrical cantilever shape. The middle portion 105 of the inferior spring element 50 is generally planar and can lie flat against a portion of the superior spring element 47 when the two components are affixed together. However, the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 descend in an arcuate fashion from the middle portion 105 to form a cantilever shape whereby the inferior spring element 50 has a concave configuration when viewed in a transverse cross-section, as shown in FIG. 112.

However, the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 descend in an arcuate fashion from the middle portion 105 to form a cantilever shape whereby the inferior spring element 50 has a concave configuration when viewed in a transverse cross-section, as shown in FIG. 114.
 FIG. 114 is a cross-sectional view of the spring element 51 shown in FIG. 113 taken along line 114-114, and shown with the superior side 37 up. It can be seen by comparing FIGS. 111 and 133, and their corresponding cross-sectional views shown in FIGS. 112 and 114, that the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIGS. 113 and 114 has an asymmetric shape. The length of the lever arm of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 is shorter than that present on the lateral side 36, and at the lateral and posterior corner. This can serve to enhance the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and also the torsional stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36, and create a line a flexion 54.

 FIG. 126 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50. The inferior anterior spring element 48.2 is affixed by three fasteners 29 directly to the superior spring element 47 near the anterior side 33. The inferior spring element 50 is also affixed to the superior spring element 47 by a fastener 29. The approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of a wearer's foot corresponding to the spring element 51 and an associated article of footwear 22 is normally slightly less than 70 percent of the length of an article of footwear 22 as measured from the posterior side 34 on the medial side 35, and greater than 60 percent of the length of an article of footwear 22 as measured from the posterior side 34 on the lateral side 36, but still somewhat less than on the medial side 35, as shown by line 104.
 FIG. 127 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50.

As shown in FIG. 127, the posteriormost portion of the anterior spacer 55.2 upon which the superior spring element 47 and inferior anterior spring element 48.2 bear is shown by a dashed line that is anterior and parallel to line 104 indicating the approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints.
 FIG. 128 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50.

As shown in FIG. 127, the posteriormost portion of the anterior spacer 55.2 upon which the superior spring element 47 and inferior anterior spring element 48.2 bear is shown by a dashed line that converges towards line 104 on the medial side 35.
 FIG. 129 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50. The inferior anterior spring element 48.2 is affixed by three fasteners 29 to the anterior spacer 55.2 and the superior spring element 47 near the anterior side 33. As shown in FIG. 127, the posteriormost portion of the anterior spacer 55.2 upon which the superior spring element 47 and inferior anterior spring element 48.2 bear is shown by a dashed line that converges towards line 104 on the medial side 35 more dramatically than the spring element 51 embodiment shown in FIG. 128.
 FIG. 130 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50. The inferior anterior spring element 48.2 is affixed by one fastener 29 directly to the superior spring element 47 near the anterior side 33.
 FIG. 131 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 generally similar to that shown in a side view in FIG. 49 including a superior spring element 47, an inferior anterior spring element 48.2, and an inferior spring element 50. The inferior anterior spring element 48.2 is affixed by one fastener 29 directly to the superior spring element 47 near the anterior side 33. However, the inferior anterior spring element 48.2 has less overall anterior to posterior length, and in particular, less area posterior of line 104 than the embodiment shown in FIG. 130.
 FIG. 132 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47, and an inferior spring element 50 having a U-shape. The inferior spring element 50 can be affixed to the superior spring element 47 with two fasteners and includes a notch 71 that can extend to various lengths in the middle portion 105 thereby imparting to the inferior spring element 50 a U-shape.
 FIG. 133 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47, and an inferior spring element 50 having a J-shape. The inferior spring element 50 can be affixed to the superior spring element 47 with two fasteners and includes a notch 71 that can extend to various lengths in the middle portion 105 thereby imparting to the inferior spring element 50 a J-shape.
 FIG. 134 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 including portions having a gently curved convex shape. The inferior spring element 50 can be curved upwards about a portion of the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34. This can increase the exhibited stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 about the sides in these areas. As result, the generally planar middle portion 105 of the inferior spring element 50 in the area anterior of the flexural axis 59 can assume most of the work associated with flexion and torsion. In some applications, the use of a curved convex structure or other method of increasing the stiffness of a specific portion of a spring element 51 can possibly be used to enhance the stability and performance of an article of footwear.
 FIG. 135 is a cross-sectional view of the spring element 51 shown in FIG. 134 taken along line 135-135 showing a superior spring element 47 having a gently curved convex shape so as to better accommodate the shape of a wearer's heel, and an inferior spring element 50 having a similar convex shape including an outsole 43 affixed thereto.
 FIG. 136 is a cross-sectional view of an alternate spring element 51 taken at a position similar to that shown in FIG. 134. Again, the superior spring element 47 has a gently curved convex shape that can better accommodate the shape of a wearer's heel. However, the inferior spring element 50 has a cantilever shape including a concavity 76 in the middle portion 105. The middle portion 105 of the inferior spring element 50 is generally planar and can lie flat against a portion of the superior spring element 47 when the two components are affixed together. However, a portion of the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 descends from the middle portion 105 to form a curved cantilever shape. Further, the inferior spring element 50 is curved slightly upwards at the edges about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34. The possible introduction of curvature at the edges of an inferior spring element 50 can also be used to effect the exhibited flexural and torsional stiffness of the component, as desired. As shown, an outsole 43 can be affixed to the curved edge portions of the inferior spring element 50.
 FIG. 137 is a side view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 including toe spring in the forefoot area 58 and an inferior spring element 50 including a compound curved shape forming a concavity 76 in the midfoot area 67.

 FIG. 149 is a side view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47, a posterior spacer 42, and an inferior spring element 50 that is orientated downward along the posterior spacer 42, but which is relatively flat near the posterior side 34. As shown, a posterior spacer 42 can provide a substantial elevation in the rearfoot area 68.
 FIG. 150 is a side view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 made in continuity with an inferior spring element 50 forming an elliptical shape on the posterior side 34. As shown, the anterior portion of the inferior spring element 50 is affixed to a posterior spacer 42 which can provide substantial elevation in the rearfoot area 68. Alternately, an inferior spring element 50 can be made as a separate part, and can then be affixed to a posterior spacer 42 and/or superior spring element 47 near the anterior end of the inferior spring element 50, and also be affixed to the superior spring element 47 near the posterior end of the inferior spring element 50.
While it is generally preferred or advantageous that the inferior spring element 50 and flexural axis 59 be positioned in the midfoot area 67 or rearfoot area 68, it is possible for the inferior spring element 50 to extend into the anterior portion of the midfoot area 67 and forefoot area 58, as shown in FIGS. 151-154, and the like. FIG. 151 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. Line 104 indicates the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints relative to the superior spring element 47. Again, on the medial side 35 the metatarsal-phalangeal joints are commonly found at slightly less than 70 percent of foot length and on the lateral side 36 greater than 60 percent of foot length, but yet somewhat less than on the medial side 35, that is, as measured from the posterior side 34 of an article of footwear 22. FIG. 151 illustrates the possibility of the flexural axis 59 being generally consistent with line 104.
 FIG. 152 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. Line 104 indicates the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints relative to the superior spring element 47. FIG. 152 illustrates the possibility of the flexural axis 59 being posterior and generally parallel to line 104.
 FIG. 153 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. Line 104 indicates the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints relative to the superior spring element 47. FIG. 153 illustrates the possibility of the flexural axis 59 being posterior and generally parallel to line 104 on the medial side 35, but then curved posteriorly away from line 104 on the lateral side 36.
 FIG. 154 is a bottom plan view of a spring element 51 consisting of a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. Line 104 indicates the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints relative to the superior spring element 47. FIG. 154 illustrates the possibility of the flexural axis 59 being posterior and curved posteriorly away from line 104 on the medial side 35 and lateral side 36.
 FIG. 155 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 which can consist solely of a superior spring element 47, or alternately, a superior spring element 47 can serve as a sub-component of a more complex spring element 51, such as one that could further include an inferior spring element 50. Further, a spring element 51 can extend substantially the entire length of an article of footwear 22, thus in the forefoot area 58, midfoot area 67, and rearfoot area 68, or alternately, in only a portion of the length of an article of footwear 22. In this regard, a spring element 51 can be positioned in solely the rearfoot area 68, or alternately the rearfoot area 68 and midfoot area 67, or alternately solely in the forefoot area 58, or alternately the forefoot area 58 and midfoot area 67. Also shown in FIG. 155 are three primary characteristic last shapes corresponding to the insole net, top net, or bottom net associated with a given last or configuration of an article of footwear 22. In this regard, on the medial side 35 is shown a line corresponding to straight last 108, semi-curved last 106, and curved last 107 configurations. A semi-curved last 106 shape is used in most of the drawing figures herein, but it can be readily understood that a more curved last 107 or straight last 108 configuration can be used in any or all of the embodiments. It can be readily understood that the teachings regarding possible alternate embodiments, structure, and function contained in this paragraph can also be applied to many of the other embodiments shown in the drawing figures of this patent application, and in particular to FIGS. 155-220, but for the sake of brevity the relevant discussion contained in this paragraph will not be repeated in association with each embodiment and drawing figure.
 FIG. 156 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 that includes a notch 71 on the lateral side 36 posterior of the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line 104. The inclusion of a notch 71 can reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited along the longitudinal axis 59, but also the torsional stiffness exhibited as between the forefoot area 58, and both the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68. The inclusion of a notch 71 can also create a potential or actual generally transverse line of flexion 54 as between the medial side 35 and the lateral side 36 of the spring element 51.
At higher walking or running speeds, or when jumping, it is known that individuals often impart higher forces on the medial side 35 of the forefoot 58 to greater degree than the lateral side 36, and so there can then sometimes be a need, and it can be advantageous to provide greater stiffness on the medial side 35 of the forefoot area 58. Further, given the biomechanical events associated with walking and running, it can be advantageous to reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side 36 of the forefoot area 58 relative to the medial side 35, as this can reduce the length of the effective lever arm formed by the spring element 51 and sole 32 of an article of footwear 22, thereby reduce the rate and magnitude of inward rotation of the foot and so enhance stability and performance. In addition, reducing the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side 36 of the forefoot area 58 can increase the amount of deflection which takes place during impact and the ground support phase of the gait cycle, thus enhance perceived and actual cushioning effects. Moreover, the transition and work performed by the foot during the ground support phase can then be smoother and more economical, but also more natural or comfortable for a wearer. It can be readily understood that this description of biomechanical events and advantageous function could apply to many of the embodiments recited in the specification and shown in the drawing figures of this patent application, but for the sake of brevity the discussion contained in this paragraph will not be repeated in association with each embodiment and drawing figure.
 FIG. 157 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 that includes two notches 71 on the lateral side 36, a first notch 71 posterior and a second notch 71 anterior of the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line 104. The inclusion of notches 71 can reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited along the longitudinal axis 59, and in particular, in the area between both notches 71. Further, the inclusion of notches 71 can also reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited in the area between both notches 71, and also as between the forefoot area 58, and both the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68. The inclusion of notches 71 can also create at least one potential or actual generally transverse line of flexion 54 as between the medial side 35 and the lateral side 36 of the spring element 51, but also at least one potential or actual generally longitudinal line of flexion 54 as between adjacent notches 71 located on the same side.
 FIG. 158 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 that includes two notches 71 on the lateral side 36, a first notch 71 posterior and a second notch 71 anterior of the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line 104. Further, the spring element 51 includes one notch 71 on the medial side 35 that is generally transverse and opposing the anteriormost notch 71 on the lateral side 36.
Again, The inclusion of notches 71 can reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited along the longitudinal axis 59, and in particular, in the area between both notches 71. Further, the inclusion of notches 71 can also reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited in the area between both notches 71, and also as between the forefoot area 58, and both the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68. The inclusion of notches 71 can also create at least one potential or actual generally transverse line of flexion 54 as between the medial side 35 and the lateral side 36 of the spring element 51, but also at least one potential or actual generally longitudinal line of flexion 54 as between adjacent notches 71 located on the same side. It can be readily understood that this description of function could apply to many of the embodiments recited in the specification and shown in the drawing figures of this patent application, but for the sake of brevity the discussion contained in this paragraph will not be repeated in association with each embodiment and drawing figure.

The sole 32 including the fluid-filled bladders 101.1, 101.2, the inferior spring element 50, anterior spring element 48.2, anterior outsole element 44, and posterior outsole element 46, can be affixed to the shoe upper 23 and superior spring element 47 with at least one fastener 29. As shown, the anterior outsole element 44 includes a backing 30 which wraps around both the posterior and anterior ends of the anterior spring element 48.2, and the backing can be secured by being at least partially trapped between the anterior spacer 55.2 and/or affixed by at least one fastener 29.
 FIG. 306 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a shoe upper 22, insole 31, fastener 29 having a male part 85 and a female part 86, a male mating structure 128 and a female mating structure 129, an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30, a posterior outsole element 46 including a backing 30 and a pocket 131, a spring element 51 including an inferior spring element 50, and a superior spring element 47 including both an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49. Also indicated are the anterior side 33, posterior side 34, superior side 37, and inferior side of the article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 307 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 306. As can be readily understood from studying FIG. 307, the anterior outsole element 44 can be inserted into the shoe upper 23 and the outsole portions 43 can pass through the corresponding registered openings 72 in the inferior side 34 of the upper 23 and be at least partially mechanically secured in place. The relatively thin backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 extends about and between the area of the openings 72 in the upper and prevents the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 from passing through the upper 23. The anterior spring element 48 can include at least one male mating structure 128 having a protuberance 99 for mating with a corresponding opening 72 or female mating structure 129 in the backing 30 or other portion of the anterior outsole element 44. Accordingly, when the anterior spring element 48 is inserted into the shoe upper 23 it can at least partially be mechanically secured in place. The posterior spring element 49 can then be inserted into the shoe upper 23, and it can overlap the anterior spring element 48, and can possibly include a recess for accommodating and actually mating with the anterior spring element 48, as shown in FIG. 309. A fastener 29 including a male part 85, as shown, or alternately, a female part 86 can be inserted into an opening 72 in the superior spring element 49 which corresponds and registers with openings in the anterior spring element 48, the web or backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, shoe upper 23, inferior spring element 50, and the web or backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46. The posterior outsole element 46 can then be slipped over the posterior end of the inferior spring element 50 and thereby at least partially mechanically secured in place, and the opening 72 in the resulting unit for accommodating the fastener 29 can be appropriately positioned enabling the male part 85, or alternately the female part 86, as shown, to be inserted therethrough from the inferior side 38 and then be mechanically secured to the corresponding mating part of the fastener 29 which is inserted from the superior side 37. This method and process of affixing the components of an article of footwear 22 can thereby be accomplished in a matter of seconds and easily in less than one minute. Accordingly, given a ready stock of components, an article of footwear 22 can be customized and made to order immediately upon request, and any part can be removed, and replaced, as desired.
 FIG. 308 is a top plan view of the insole 31 shown in FIGS. 306 and 307. In order to provide comfort, cushioning, and support in functional relation to the underlying superior spring element 47, it is important that a relatively high quality insole be used such as one made of foamed neoprene rubber including a textile cover having an overall thickness of approximately 3.75 mm, or one made of polyurethane such as PORONÂ® which is made by the 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn., and the like. Again, it can be advantageous to use a custom molded insole as taught by the present inventor in U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,057, and also U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,502, entitled âMethod of Making Custom Insoles and Point of Purchase Display, both of these documents having been previously incorporated by reference herein.
 FIG. 309 is a top plan view of a spring element 51 showing a superior spring element 47 including both a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48. Shown for reference purposes are the anterior side 33, posterior side 34, medial side 35, lateral side 36, and general orientation of the longitudinal axis 69, and transverse axis 91. The posterior spring element 49 overlaps a portion of the anterior spring element 48 which is shown in dashed lines. The posterior spring element 49 has a cupped shape so as to accommodate and encompass at least some of the natural anatomical characteristics of the heel of a wearer, and this three dimensional structure enables the part to exhibit relatively high flexural modulus or stiffness, thus permitting it to be made in a thin cross-sectional thickness resulting in low weight and reduced cost. The posterior spring element 49 can be made of a glass or carbon fiber composite material, or alternately, of a relatively rigid reinforced thermoplastic material including short or long fibers. Again, Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich. makes SPECTRUMÂ® reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts, and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton, Pa. makes THERMOCOMPÂ® and VERTONÂ® thermoplastic materials which can include long carbon fibers. The posterior spring element 49 also includes a projection 70 on the anterior and medial side which has the effect of increasing the stiffness of the medial side 35 of the spring element 51 in the associated area. Both the posterior spring element 49 and the anterior spring element 48 include an opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29, and can include a protective wear prevention insert 130 therein for bearing directly upon a portion of the fastener 29.
The anterior spring element 48 includes a plurality of notches 71 for influencing the longitudinal, transverse, and torsional stiffness, and overall performance of the part. The presence, location, shape, length, depth, and number of the notches 71 can be varied to make the anterior spring element more suitable for a particular activity, or a particular individual. The embodiment shown in FIG. 309 is appropriate for use in a running shoe. The longitudinal notch 71.1 near the anterior side 33 extends to the anteriormost transverse line of flexion 54.2 and creates two opposing fingers 109.1 and 109.2 on the medial side 35 and lateral side 36, respectively. Given a spring element intended for use in a men's size 9 article of footwear, notches 71.5 and 71.6 on the medial side 35 can extend a relatively short distance such as approximately 15 mm, whereas notches 71.2, 71.3, and 71.4 can extend for a greater distance such as approximately 25 mm. The approximate alignment of notches 71.2 and 71.5 can create a generally transverse line of flexion 54.2 anterior of the approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line 104. The approximate alignment of notches 71.3 and 71.6 can create a generally transverse line of flexion 54.3 generally consistent with the approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line 104. The orientation of notch 71.4 can create a generally diagonal line of flexion 54.4 approximately following the anterior side of the posterior spring element 49. The proximity of notches 71.5 and 71.6 can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion 54.6 therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the medial side 35 and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer's foot in an undesired manner. Similarly, the proximity of notches 71.2 and 71.3 and 71.4 can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion 54.1 therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the lateral side 36 and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer's foot in an undesired manner.
In particular, on the lateral side 36 of the forefoot area 58 of a running shoe, it can be advantageous to create an extended area characterized by reduced stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness, or what can be called a âforefoot strike zoneâ somewhat analogous to the ârearfoot strike zoneâ which has been previously taught by the inventor in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,425,184, 5,625,964, and 6,055,746, hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further, it can be advantageous in a running shoe for the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side 36 of the anterior spring element 48 in the forefoot area 58 to be less than that exhibited on the medial side 35, and by a factor generally in the range between 10-50 percent. In this regard, it is generally known by those who study biomechanics that at lower speeds, as when an individual is walking or running slowly, the lateral side of the human foot is used to greater degree than when running at high speeds, thus the human foot can exhibit differential stiffness and utilization as between the lateral side and medial side. In brief, as result of the presence, location, shape, length, depth, and number of the notches 71 shown in FIG. 309, the anterior spring element 48 is perceived to provide enhanced cushioning, stability, and performance effects without the flexural or torsional modulus characteristics of the fiber composite material causing dysfunctional leverage effects or other undesired perceived phenomenon. Other configurations are possible and anticipated, e.g., notches 71.6 and 71.3 could be moved more towards the posterior side 34 to be placed well behind line 104 indicating the approximate location of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints.
 FIG. 310 is a bottom plan view of the spring element 51 shown in FIG. 309 showing an inferior spring element 50, and a superior spring element 47 including both a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 that is substantially hidden by the anterior outsole element 44, thus shown by a dashed line. Shown are the anterior outsole element 44 and the posterior outsole element 46 including a web or backing 30 portion. The inferior side of the male mating structure 128 including a protuberance 99 is shown in functional relation with an opening or female mating structure in the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44.
 FIG. 311 is a top plan view of an alternate posterior spring element 49 for use with an article of footwear 22 that includes raised heel counter 24 portions on both the medial side 35 and the lateral side 36 which are best shown in a side view of an article of footwear such as FIG. 323. Shown for reference purposes is the general orientation of the longitudinal axis 67, transverse axis 91, medial side 35, lateral side, anterior side 33 and posterior side 34. Also shown is the approximate position corresponding to the weight bearing center of the heel 57 of a wearer. In addition, a triangular opening 72 for accommodating a fastener that includes a wear prevention insert 130 is also shown in FIG. 311.
 FIG. 312 is a top plan view of an alternate anterior spring element 48 which is generally similar to that shown in FIG. 309 for use with the posterior spring element 49 shown in FIG. 311. However, the shape of the part is different in several respects, e.g., the posterior side 34 of the anterior spring element 48 is formed in a diagonal shape, and the opening 72 for accommodating a fastener has a triangular instead of a pentagon shape.
 FIG. 313 is a top plan view of the posterior spring element 49 of FIG. 311 and the anterior spring element 48 of FIG. 312 positioned in functional relation with the posterior spring element 49 overlapping the superior side 37 of the anterior spring element 48. In an alternate embodiment, the overlapping relationship can be reversed.
 FIG. 314 is a bottom plan view of the posterior spring element 49 of FIG. 311 and the anterior spring element 48 of FIG. 312 positioned in functional relation with the posterior spring element 49 overlapping the anterior spring element 48, but with the addition of the anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 and an outsole 43 including six traction members 115. As shown, the posterior spring element 49 overlaps the anterior outsole element 44 on the superior side 37, thus the anterior outsole elements 44 passes underneath the posterior spring element 49. In an alternate embodiment, the overlapping relationship of these three components can be varied. On the superior side 37, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 includes a plurality of male mating structures 128 including a protuberance 99 which can mechanically mate with female mating structures 129 in the anterior spring element 48, and thereby at least partially secure the anterior outsole element 44 in functional relation to the overlaying anterior spring element 48.
 FIG. 315 is a top plan view of an alternate posterior spring element 49 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 311 for use with an article of footwear 22 that includes raised heel counter 24 portions on both the medial side 35 and the lateral side 36 which are best shown in a side view of an article of footwear such as FIG. 323. Shown for reference purposes is the general orientation of the longitudinal axis 67, transverse axis 91, medial side 35, lateral side, anterior side 33 and posterior side 34. Also shown is the approximate position corresponding to the weight bearing center of the heel 57 of a wearer. Further, a hexagonal opening 72 for accommodating a fastener that includes a wear prevention insert 130 is also shown in FIG. 315. In addition, the posterior spring element 49 includes a recess 84 on the superior side 37 for accommodating and mechanically mating with the posterior portion of an anterior spring element 48. The location of a length measurement that is taken between the center of opening 72 and the posterior side 34, and also the location of a transverse width measurement that extends between the medial side 35 and lateral side 36 and intersects the center of the opening 72 is also shown in FIG. 315.
 FIG. 316 is a top plan view of an alternate anterior spring element 48 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 312 for use with the posterior spring element 49 shown in FIG. 315. However, the shape of the part is different in several respects, e.g., the posterior side 34 of the anterior spring element 48 is formed in a pointed shape thereby forming a projection 70, and the opening 72 for accommodating a fastener has a hexagon shape instead of a triangular shape. The location of a length measurement that is taken between the center of opening 72 and the anterior side 33, and also the location of a transverse width measurement that extends along line 104 between the medial side 35 and lateral side 36 is also shown in FIG. 316.
 FIG. 317 is a top plan view of the posterior spring element 49 of FIG. 315 and the anterior spring element 48 of FIG. 316 positioned in functional relation with the anterior spring element 48 overlapping the superior side 37 of the posterior spring element 49. In an alternate embodiment, the overlapping relationship can be reversed. The pointed shape of the projection 70 of the anterior spring element 48 is shown positioned in functional relation and at least partially secured by mechanical means within the recess 84 of the posterior spring element 49.
 FIG. 318 is a bottom plan view of the posterior spring element 49 of FIG. 315 and the anterior spring element 48 of FIG. 316 positioned in functional relation with the anterior spring element 48 overlapping the superior side 37 of the posterior spring element 49, but with the addition of an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 and an outsole 43 including six traction members 115. Similar to the anterior spring element 48, a portion of the anterior outsole element 44 also has a pointed shape including a projection 70.1 that overlaps the superior side 37 of the posterior spring element 49. In an alternate embodiment, the overlapping relationship of these three components can be varied. On the superior side 37, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 includes a plurality of male mating structures 128 including a protuberance 99 which can mechanically mate with female mating structures 129 in the anterior spring element 48, and thereby at least partially secure the anterior outsole element 44 in functional relation to the overlaying anterior spring element 48.
 FIG. 319 is a top plan view of the superior side 37 of an inferior spring element 50 to which has been mounted a posterior outsole element 46 including a backing 30 and outsole 43. If desired, the backing 30 can be substantially transparent and can enable the portion of the posterior spring element 49 that is inserted into an opening or pocket 131 therein to be seen, as shown in FIG. 319. As shown, the backing 30 and/or posterior outsole element 46 can encompass a portion of the medial side 35, lateral side 36, superior side 37, inferior side 38, and posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 forming an opening or pocket 131 into which a portion of the inferior spring element 50 can be removably inserted, thereby at least partially securing the posterior outsole element 46 by mechanical means in functional relation to the inferior spring element 50. Also shown is a triangular opening 72 including a wear prevention insert 130 for accommodating a fastener, thus the embodiment shown could be used with the posterior spring element 49, anterior spring element 48, and anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIG. 314.
 FIG. 320 is a bottom plan view of the inferior spring element 50 and posterior outsole element 46 shown in FIG. 319. Near the anterior side 33, the web or backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 emerges from the ground engaging portion of the outsole 43 in a relatively superior position and the backing 30 also includes an opening 72 that registers with the similar opening present in the inferior spring element 50 for accommodating a fastener. Accordingly, once the inferior spring element 50 is inserted into the pocket 131 formed by posterior outsole element 46 and a fastener passes through the opening 72 present in the backing 30 and inferior spring element, the posterior outsole element 46 can be firmly secured solely by mechanical means to a larger spring element 51 and article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 321 is a bottom plan view of an inferior spring element 50 similar to that shown in FIG. 320 with a posterior outsole element 46 having an alternate design. As shown, the web or backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 can be exposed in many areas creating a striking visual design, and in particular, when contrasting colors are used. However, such designs can also be functional, as they can be associated with varying elevations associated with the creation of discrete traction members 115.
 FIG. 322 is a bottom plan view of an inferior spring element 50 similar to that shown in FIG. 320 with a posterior outsole element 46 having an alternate design. As shown, the web or backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 can be exposed in many areas creating a striking visual design, and in particular, when contrasting colors are used. However, such designs can also be functional, as they can be associated with varying elevations associated with the creation of discrete traction members 115. The posterior outsole element 46 and inferior spring element 50 include an opening 72 having a hexagon shape, thus the embodiment shown could be used with the posterior spring element 49, anterior spring element 48, and anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIG. 318.
 FIG. 323 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 306, but including a number of differences. Shown is a footwear last 80 and a shoe upper 23 having a different design. In the forefoot area 58, the superior side of the backing 30 includes male mating structures 128 including a protuberance 99 that is shown mechanically engaged in functional relation with a female mating structure 129 present in the anterior spring element 48. Similar to FIG. 306, the posterior spring element 49 overlaps the superior side of the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 and the anterior spring element 48, and the latter structures both terminate at a location between the position of the fastener 29 and the posterior side 34 of the article of footwear 22. When a footwear last 80 or other three dimensional design and pattern of an article of footwear 22 includes a curved arch portion, this construction can be advantageous since it enables an especially smooth transition between the posterior spring element 49 and the anterior spring element 48 and anterior outsole element 44. As shown in FIG. 323, the posterior spring element 49 extends upwards and about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming a heel counter 24.
 FIG. 324 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. The anterior spring element 48 overlaps the superior side of the posterior spring element 49 and is mechanically engaged by a recess 84.1 therein which is generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 315-317. The posterior spring element 49 overlaps the superior side of the posterior portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44, and is also mechanically engaged by a recess 84.2 therein. As shown in FIG. 324, the thickness of the posterior portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 can be varied in the area near the anterior side of the posterior spring element 49 in order to achieve a smooth transition. As shown in FIG. 324, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 can extend substantially to the posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 and can be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming a heel counter 24. Alternately, the posterior spring element 49 can be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming a heel counter 24, or alternately, both the posterior spring element 49 and the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 can form a heel counter 24.
 FIG. 325 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. The posterior spring element 49 overlaps both the anterior spring element 48 and the posterior portion of the web or backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44. The anterior spring element 48 terminates a relatively short distance posterior of the position of the fastener 29, but the posterior portion of the web or backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 extends substantially to the posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23. Again, as shown in FIG. 324, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 can extend substantially to the posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 and can be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming a heel counter 24. Alternately, the posterior spring element 49 can be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming a heel counter 24, or alternately, both the posterior spring element 49 and the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 can form a heel counter 24.
 FIG. 326 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. Both the anterior spring element 48 and the posterior portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 overlap the anterior portion of the superior side of the posterior spring element 49 and are mechanically engaged by a recess 84 therein which is generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 315-317. However, a substantial portion of the thickness of the posterior spring element 49 is maintained and extends to its anterior side, thus creating a more pronounced inferior standoff position for the inferior spring element 50 to bear loads against and be mechanically affixed thereto. The three dimensional curved shape of the posterior spring element 49 associated with the area of the recess 84 can have the effect of strengthening the part and increasing its flexural modulus. The more pronounced inferior standoff configuration can potentially accommodate for greater deflection of the inferior spring element 50, and/or make available more space between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 for the insertion of other cushioning media such a fluid-filled bladders, foam materials, thermoplastic structures having geometric shapes, and the like.
 FIG. 327 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. The posterior portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 terminates anterior of the position of the fastener 29. The anterior spring element 48 extends from a position near the anterior side 33 towards the posterior side 34 and passes through a slit 82 in the inferior side 38 of the shoe upper 23 that approximately coincides with the position of the fastener 29. In a bottom plan view, the slit 82 is substantially hidden from view by that portion of the inferior spring element 50 which bears against the inferior side 38 of the shoe upper 23. The posterior portion of the anterior spring element 48 thereby emerges from within the shoe upper 23 to the exterior side thereof and can be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 of the shoe upper 23 forming an external heel counter 24.1. The posterior spring element 49 can also be curved upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and posterior side 34 within the shoe upper 23 forming an internal heel counter 24.2 which can mechanically mate with the external heel counter 24.1 thereby firmly securing the shoe upper 23 therebetween when the fastener 29 is affixed in position.
 FIG. 328 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. Shown in FIG. 328 is a fluid-filled bladder 101 having a wall 132 and a chamber 133 that is substantially located between the posterior spring element 49 and the inferior spring element 50. The fluid-filled bladder 101 can be inserted through the open space provided for entry and exit of a wearer's foot into an opening 72 in the inferior side 38 of the shoe upper 23 that closely registers with the shape of the downwardly projecting structure of the fluid-filled bladder 101, and the fluid-filled bladder 101 can be at least partially maintained in position and prevented from passing through the opening 72 by the existence of a flange 124 thereupon. The fluid-filled bladder 101 can then be firmly secured in position by the insertion of the posterior spring element 49 into the shoe upper 23 in a superior position relative to the fluid-filled bladder 101, and also by affixing the posterior spring element 49 with a fastener 29 to the inferior spring element 50. Alternately, the fluid-filled bladder can be affixed in functional relation to the shoe upper 23 and/or the inferior spring element 50 with the use of adhesives, bonding, or welding, and other conventional methods.
 FIG. 329 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 328, but including a number of differences. As shown, the article of footwear 22 includes two fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2. Fluid-filled bladder 101.1 can be affixed by adhesives, bonding, welding, or other conventional means to the superior side of the backing 30 that is present on the superior side of the inferior spring element 50, and likewise, fluid-filled bladder 101.2 can be affixed by adhesives, bonding, welding, or other conventional means to the inferior side of the backing 30 that is present on the inferior side of the inferior spring element 50. Accordingly, the posterior outsole element 46 including the backing 30 and both the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be removed and replaced when the fastener 29 is removed and the inferior spring element 50 is slipped out of the pocket 131.
 FIG. 330 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 329, but including a number of differences. As shown, the article of footwear 22 includes two fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2. Fluid-filled bladder 101.1 is integrally formed with so that its inferior wall 132 also serves as the backing 30 that is present on the superior side of the inferior spring element 50, or vice-versa, and likewise, fluid-filled bladder 101.2 is integrally formed with so that its superior wall 132 also serves as the backing 30 that is present on the inferior side of the inferior spring element 50. Accordingly, the posterior outsole element 46 including the backing 30 and both the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be removed and replaced when the fastener 29 is removed and the inferior spring element 50 is slipped out of the pocket 131. As shown, the superior wall 132 of fluid-filled bladder 101.1 can extend anteriorly and be secured between the inferior spring element 50 and the superior spring element 47, or alternately, the superior wall 132 can terminate at a position posterior of the point of contact between the inferior spring element 50 and the inferior portion of the shoe upper 23 or superior spring element 47.
 FIG. 331 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 328, but including a number of differences. Fluid-filled bladder 101 can be seen and can optionally protrude from an opening 72 in the superior side of the insole 31, but it can also be seen and protrude from a corresponding registered opening in the inferior side of the shoe upper 23. The fluid-filled bladder 101 can be inserted and secured in position in the same manner as the embodiment recited in FIG. 328. However, as shown in FIG. 331, the inferior wall 132 of the fluid-filled bladder 101 can alternately be integrally formed with the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, or alternately, the superior wall 132 of the fluid-filled bladder 101 can be integrally formed with the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44.
 FIG. 332 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 328, but including a number of differences. Shown is a fluid-filled bladder 101 including a superior wall 132.1 and an inferior wall 132.2 and a plurality of chambers 133. The chambers 133 can be in fluid communication with one another, or alternately, the chambers 133 can be in fluid isolation from one another. The plurality of chambers 133 protrude from a plurality of corresponding registered openings 72 in the superior side of the backing which overlaps the superior side of the inferior spring element 50. Accordingly, the fluid-filled bladder 101 can be inserted into the pocket 130 formed by the shape of the backing 30 of the posterior outsole element 46 and the protruding chambers 133 can then be properly fitted, that is, pop into place so as to protrude from the openings 72. The inferior spring element 50 can then be inserted into the pocket 131 thereby trapping and mechanically securing the fluid-filled bladder 101 in position.
 FIG. 333 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 331, but including a number of differences. Shown is a fluid-filled bladder 101.1 including a wall 132 and a plurality of chambers 133 that is integrally formed with its superior side being coincident with a posterior portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44, and also a fluid-filled bladder 101.2 which is integrally formed with its superior side being coincident with a portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44. As shown and discussed previously in connection with FIG. 300, the individual chambers 133 can be formed in a semi-spherical or dome shape, or other common geometric shapes. The spacing between the chambers 133 can be varied, and the semi-spherical or other geometric shapes can also be alternately inverted and stacked upon one another in the vertical dimension as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,098,313, 6,029,962, 5,976,451, and 5,572,804 granted to Joseph Skaja and/or Martyn Shorten, all of these patents being previously incorporated by reference herein.
 FIG. 334 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 331, but including a number of differences. In particular, a foam cushioning element 135 made of foam material 134 having a web 144 portion including a flange 124 can instead be stock-fitted into an opening 72 in the inferior side of the shoe upper 23 and can protrude downwards therefrom to engage the inferior spring element 50 when the article of footwear 22 is sufficiently loaded by a wearer. The foam cushioning element 135 can be made in a multiplicity of alternate shapes. Alternately, the foam cushioning element 135 made of foam material 134 can be affixed to a backing 30 including a flange 124 made of a different material, that is, instead of having a web 144 and flange 124 made in continuity of a single homogenous foam material 124 as is shown. Again, the foam cushioning element 135.1 can be inserted into the shoe upper 23 and secured in place by mechanical means, and also be removed and replaced, as desired.
 FIG. 335 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 332, but including a number of differences. In particular, a foam cushioning element 135 made foam material 134 having a web 114 portion including a flange 124 and three columns can instead be stock-fitted into an opening 72 in the superior side of the backing 30 on the superior side of the inferior spring element 50 and can protrude upwards therefrom to engage the inferior side of the shoe upper 23 when the article of footwear 22 is sufficiently loaded by a wearer. The foam cushioning element 135 can be made in a multiplicity of alternate shapes. Alternately, the foam cushioning element 135 made of foam material 134 can be affixed to a backing 30 including a flange 124 made of a different material, that is, instead of having a web 144 and flange 124 made in continuity of a single homogenous foam material 124 as shown. Again, the foam cushioning element 135 can be inserted into a pocket 130 formed by the backing 30 of the posterior outsole element 46 and secured in place by mechanical means, and also be removed and replaced, as desired.
 FIG. 336 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 323, but including a number of differences. In this embodiment, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 includes an upwardly extending stability element 136 including stability element portions 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 which can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the upper 23 and article of footwear 22. When a textile material or other material having elastic or substantial elongation characteristics is used in the construction of the forefoot area 58 of the upper 23, the presence of the stability element 136 including portions 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 can at least in part define the shape and fit of the upper 23, and in particular, can prevent trauma to a wearer's toes due to the elastic material possibly working against and dragging across a wearer's toenails. Given the use of an upper 23 including a textile material or other material having elastic or substantial elongation characteristics in the forefoot area 58, it is also possible for the upper 23 to accommodate wearers having a range of different size length and width. For example, a given size small upper 23 could accommodate men's sizes in the range between size lengths 7-8.5, and size widths A-E; a given size medium upper 23 could accommodate men's sizes in the range between size lengths 9-10.5, and size widths A-E; and, a given large upper 23 could accommodate men's sizes in the range between size lengths 11-12.5, and size widths A-E. Further, the anterior outsole element 44 including the stability element 136 can be made in corresponding small, medium, and large sizes. Moreover, the anterior outsole element 44 including the stability element 136 can be made in more specific sizes corresponding to each Â½ inch length size, and also each width size graduation between A-E. Furthermore, an anterior outsole element 44 possibly including a stability element 136 can be made in various different three dimensional shapes and configurations generally corresponding to different footwear lasts 80, or other type of three dimensional rendering, or database relating to a desired model or pattern foot shape. The particular desired foot shape can be derived from a given individual wearer, and a customized anterior outsole element 44 possibly including a stability element 136 can be custom formed for the wearer when at least the backing portion 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 which can also substantially form the elevated structure of the stability element 136 is made from a thermoplastic material. It can be readily understood that alternate and generally equivalent sizing can also be made available using other footwear sizing scales and methods. Accordingly, an anterior outsole element 44 which can possibly include a stability element 136 can be used to at least partially define the length size and width size in the forefoot area 58, and thereby, more generally the length size and width size of an article of footwear 22.
Stability element 131.1 can wrap about the anterior side 33 within the upper 23, and stability elements 131.2 and 131.3 can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. Accordingly, a direct mechanical link can exist between the traction members 155 that are present on the anterior outsole element 44 and the stability elements 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3. The stability elements 136.1, 136.2 and 136.3 include notches 71.1 and 71.2 on the lateral side 36, and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side 35. The position of notch 71.2 approximately coincides with the location of a wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 and the position of notch 71.1 is more anterior, thus the stability elements 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer's foot about the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The notches 71.1 and 71.2 terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the backing 30 curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48. It can be advantageous that the insole 31 extend upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and anterior side 33 to greater degree than is customary in a typical article of footwear in order to cushion and protect the wearer's foot from making substantial direct contact with the stability elements 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3, as shown in FIGS. 447, 448, and 480. If desired, the backing 30 and stability elements 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 can be made of a transparent material as shown. It is anticipated that stability element 136 could be made in various alternate configurations, e.g., the stability element 136 could possibly extends upwards and be integrated with closure means such as laces or straps.
 FIG. 337 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 336, but including a number of differences. In this embodiment, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 includes upwardly extending stability element 136 including stability element portions 136.1, 136.2, and 136.4 which can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the article of footwear 22. Stability element 136.1 can wrap about the anterior side 33 within the upper 23, and stability elements 136.2 and 136.4 can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. In particular, stability element 136.4 wraps about the posterior side 34 within the upper 23 to form a heel counter 24.
 FIG. 338 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 336, but including a number of differences. In this embodiment, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 includes upwardly extending stability element 136 including stability element portions 136.1, 136.2, 136.3, and 136.5 which can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the article of footwear 22. Stability element 136.1 can wrap about the anterior side 33 within the upper 23, and stability elements 136.2, 136.3, and 136.5 can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. In particular, stability element 136.5 can wrap about the posterior side 34 within the upper 23 and form a heel counter 24. The stability elements 136.1, 136.2, 136.3 and 136.5 include notches 71.1, 71.2, and 71.3 on the lateral side 36, and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side 35. The position of notch 71.2 approximately coincides with the location of a wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 and the position of notch 71.1 is more anterior, thus the stability elements 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer's foot about the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The notches 71.1 and 71.2 terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the backing 30 curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48. The position of notch 71.3 approximately coincides with the location of the fastener 29, but also with the apex of the curvature incorporated into the footwear last 80 corresponding to the longitudinal arches of a wearer's foot in the midfoot area 67, thus can accommodate deflection of the superior spring element 47. Again, the superior spring element 47 can include an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49, as shown.
 FIG. 339 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 336, but including a number of differences. In particular, the stability elements portions 136.1 a, 136.2 a, and 136.3 a are part of a stability element 136 a that is not a part or extension of the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, rather the stability element 136 a is a separate component or feature of the exterior of the upper 23. For example, stability element 136 a can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper 23, and the like. Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper 23 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., assigned to Nike, Inc., and the like. In this embodiment, the upwardly extending stability elements 136.1 a, 136.2 a, and 136.3 a can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the article of footwear 22. Stability element 136.1 a can wrap about the anterior side 33 of the upper 23, and stability elements 136.2 a and 136.3 a can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. In an alternate construction, the anterior outsole element 44 can be eliminated, and the traction members of the outsole 43 can be directly affixed to the stability element 136 a. However, in the construction shown in FIG. 339, the traction members 115 emerge through registered openings 72 in the stability element 136 a and can bear directly thereupon when deformed by generally transverse loads. Accordingly, a direct mechanical link can exist between the traction members 115 that are present on the anterior outsole element 44 and the stability element 136 a. When a textile material or other material having elastic characteristics is used in the construction of the forefoot area 58 of the upper 23, the presence of the stability elements 136.1 a, 136.2 a, and 136.3 a can at least in part define the shape and fit of the upper 23 to which they are affixed by conventional means, and in particular, can prevent trauma to a wearer's toes due to the elastic material possibly working against and dragging across their toenails. The stability elements 136.1 a, 136.2 a and 136.3 a include notches 71.1 and 71.2 on the lateral side 36, and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side 35. The position of notch 71.2 approximately coincides with the location of a wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 and the position of notch 71.1 is more anterior, thus the stability elements 136.1 a, 136.2 a, and 136.3 a do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer's foot about the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The notches 71.1 and 71.2 terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the stability element 136 a curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48. It can be advantageous that the insole 31 extend upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and anterior side 33 to greater degree than is customary in a typical article of footwear in order to cushion and protect the wearer's foot from making substantial direct contact with the stability elements 136.1 a, 136.2 a, and 136.3 a. If desired, the stability element 136 a can be made of a transparent material as shown, or a thermoplastic material including decorative sublimation printing, and the like. The stability element 136 a could have other configurations, and portions could possibly extends upwards to link with closure means such as laces or straps included in the construction of the upper 23.
 FIG. 340 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 337, but including a number of differences. In particular, the stability elements portions 136.1 b, 136.2 b, and 136.4 b are part of a larger stability element 136 b that is not a part or extension of the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, rather the stability element 136 b is a separate component or feature of the exterior of the upper 23. For example, stability element 136 b can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper 23, and the like. Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper 23 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., assigned to Nike, Inc., and the like. In this embodiment, the upwardly extending stability elements 136.1 b, 136.2 b, and 136.4 b can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the article of footwear 22. Stability element 136.1 b can wrap about the anterior side 33 of the upper 23, and stability elements 136.2 b and 136.4 b can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. Stability element 136.4 b can wrap about the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 to form a heel counter 24. In an alternate construction, the anterior outsole element 44 can be eliminated, and the traction members of the outsole 43 can be directly affixed to the stability element 136 b. However, in the construction shown in FIG. 340, the traction members 115 emerge through registered openings 72 in the stability element 136 b and can bear directly thereupon when deformed by generally transverse loads. Accordingly, a direct mechanical link can exist between the traction members 115 that are present on the anterior outsole element 44 and the stability element 136 b. When a textile material or other material having elastic characteristics is used in the construction of the forefoot area 58 of the upper 23, the presence of the stability elements 136.1 b, 136.2 b, and 136.4 b can at least in part define the shape and fit of the upper 23 to which they are affixed by conventional means, and in particular, can prevent trauma to a wearer's toes due to the elastic material possibly working against and dragging across their toenails. The stability elements 136.1 b, 136.2 b and 136.4 b include notches 71.1 and 71.2 on the lateral side 36, and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side 35. The position of notch 71.2 approximately coincides with the location of a wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 and the position of notch 71.1 is more anterior, thus the stability elements 136.1 b, 136.2 b, and 136.4 b do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer's foot about the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The notches 71.1 and 71.2 terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the stability element 136 b curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48. It can be advantageous that the insole 31 extend upwards about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, anterior side 33, and posterior side 34 to greater degree than is customary in a typical article of footwear in order to cushion and protect the wearer's foot from making substantial direct contact with the stability elements 136.1 b, 136.2 b, and 136.4 b. If desired, the stability elements 136 b can be made of a transparent material as shown, or a thermoplastic material including decorative sublimation printing, and the like. The stability element 136 b could have other configurations, and portions could possibly extends upwards to link with closure means such as laces or straps included in the construction of the upper 23.
 FIG. 341 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 338, but including a number of differences. In particular, the stability element portions 136.1 c, 136.2 c, 136.3 c, and 136.5 c are part of a larger stability element 136 c that is not a part or extension of the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, rather the stability element 136 c is a separate component or feature of the exterior of the upper 23. For example, stability element 136 c can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper 23, and the like. Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper 23 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., assigned to Nike, Inc., and the like. In this embodiment, the upwardly extending stability elements 136.1 c, 136.2 c, 136.3 c, and 136.5 c can serve both to define the shape of the shoe upper 23, but also to stabilize the foot of a wearer in functional relation to the article of footwear 22. Stability element 136.1 c can wrap about the anterior side 33 of the upper 23, and stability elements 136.2 c, 136.3 c and 136.5 c can be complimented by like structures on the medial side 35 which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. Stability element 136.5 c can wrap about the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 to form a heel counter 24. In an alternate construction, the anterior outsole element 44 can be eliminated, and the traction members of the outsole 43 can be directly affixed to the stability element 136 c. However, in the construction shown in FIG. 341, the traction members 115 emerge through registered openings 72 in the stability element 136 c and can bear directly thereupon when deformed by generally transverse loads. Accordingly, a direct mechanical link can exist between the traction members 115 that are present on the anterior outsole element 44 and the stability element 136 c. When a textile material or other material having elastic characteristics is used in the construction of the forefoot area 58 of the upper 23, the presence of the stability elements 136.1 c, 136.2 c, 136.3 c, and 136.5 c can at least in part define the shape and fit of the upper 23 to which they are affixed by conventional means, and in particular, can prevent trauma to a wearer's toes due to the elastic material possibly working against and dragging across their toenails. The stability elements 136.1 c, 136.2 c, 136.3 c, and 136.5 c include notches 71.1 and 71.2 on the lateral side 36, and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side 35. The position of notch 71.2 approximately coincides with the location of a wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89 and the position of notch 71.1 is more anterior, thus the stability elements 136.1 c, 136.2 c, and 136.3 c do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer's foot about the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. The notches 71.1 and 71.2 terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the stability element 136 c curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48.

The stability element 136 c could have other configurations, and portions could possibly extends upwards to link with closure means such as laces or straps included in the construction of the upper 23.
 FIG. 342 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 341, but including a number of differences. As shown, the article of footwear 22 includes a first fluid-filled bladder 101.1 located between the inferior spring element 50 and the inferior side of the upper 23, and a second fluid-filled bladder 101.2 located between the anterior spring element 48.2 and the inferior side of the upper 23 including the anterior spring element 48.1. The fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be affixed using adhesive, bonding, welding, or other conventional techniques. However, it can be advantageous for the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 to be affixed by mechanical means so that they can be customized, and removed and replaced, as desired. Again, the fluid-filled bladder 101.1 can be formed so that one of the walls 132 of the bladder is coincident or affixed to a portion of the backing 30 of the posterior outsole element 46 and/or the fluid-filled bladder 101.1 can include a thin web 114 extending therefrom which can be secured between the inferior spring element 50 and the inferior side of the upper 23. Likewise, the fluid-filled bladder 101.2 can be formed so that one of the walls 132 of the bladder is coincident or affixed to a portion of the backing 30 of the anterior outsole element 44 and/or the fluid-filled bladder 101.2 can include a thin web 114 extending therefrom which can be secured between the anterior spring element 48.2 and the inferior side of the upper 23, and/or between a portion of the anterior spacer 55.2 and an adjoining mating surface.
 FIG. 343 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 342, but including a number of differences. The article of footwear 22 includes a cushioning element 135 made of foam material 134 located between the inferior spring element 50 and the inferior side of the upper 23, and a plurality of generally similar cushioning elements 135 located between the inferior anterior spring element 48.2 and the upper 23 including the superior anterior spring element 48.1. The cushioning elements 135 can be affixed using adhesive, bonding, welding, or other conventional techniques. The cushioning elements 135 can possibly be affixed at both their superior side and inferior side, or at only their superior side as shown in FIG. 344, or at only their inferior side as shown in FIG. 345, as desired. However, it can be advantageous for the cushioning elements 135 to be affixed by mechanical means so that they can be customized, and removed and replaced, as desired. In this regard, the cushioning elements 135 can be affixed to the backing 30 present on the posterior outsole element 46 and the anterior outsole element 44. Alternately, as shown and taught in FIG. 335, the cushioning elements 135 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 or anterior outsole element 44 and can thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the inferior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 48.2 is inserted into the pocket 130 formed within either the posterior outsole element 46 or the anterior outsole element 50 and the posterior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 46 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. Alternately, as shown and taught in FIG. 334, the cushioning elements 135 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the upper 23 and thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the superior spring element 47 possibly including a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48.1 is inserted into the upper 23 and the inferior spring element 50 and anterior spring element 48.2 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. The physical and mechanical properties of the various cushioning elements 135 can be homogenous, or alternately, can be heterogeneous and varied so as to provide different physical and mechanical properties in various select areas of the sole 32 of the article of footwear 22. For example, it can possibly be advantageous to reduce the stiffness of the lateral side of the sole 32 in the rearfoot area 68 and forefoot area 58 in a running shoe.
 FIG. 344 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 343, but including a number of differences. The article of footwear 22 includes a cushioning element 135 made of foam material 134 located between the inferior spring element 50 and the inferior side of the upper 23, and a plurality of generally similar cushioning elements 135 located between the anterior spring element 48.2 and the upper 23 including the anterior spring element 48.1. As shown, the cushioning elements 135 can be affixed on their superior side using adhesive, bonding, welding, or other conventional techniques. However, it can be advantageous for the cushioning elements 135 to be affixed by mechanical means so that they can be customized, and removed and replaced, as desired. As shown and taught in FIG. 334, the cushioning elements 135 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the upper 23 and thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the superior spring element 47 possibly including a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48.1 is inserted into the upper 23 and the inferior spring element 50 and anterior spring element 48.2 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. The physical and mechanical properties of the various cushioning elements 135 can be homogenous, or alternately, can be heterogeneous and varied so as to provide different physical and mechanical properties in various select areas of the sole 32 of the article of footwear 22. For example, it can possibly be advantageous to reduce the stiffness of the lateral side of the sole 32 in the rearfoot area 68 and forefoot area 58 in a running shoe.
 FIG. 345 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 344, but including a number of differences.

The fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be affixed using adhesive, bonding, welding, or other conventional techniques. The fluid-filled bladders can possibly be affixed at both their superior side and inferior side as shown in FIG. 346, or at only their superior side as shown in FIG. 347, or at only their inferior side as shown in FIG. 348, as desired. However, it can be advantageous for the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 to be affixed by mechanical means so that they can be customized, and removed and replaced, as desired. In this regard, the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be affixed to the backing 30 present on the posterior outsole element 46 and the anterior outsole element 44. Alternately, as shown and taught in FIG. 332, the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 or anterior outsole element 44 and can thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the inferior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 48.2 is inserted into the pocket 130 formed within either the posterior outsole element 46 or the anterior outsole element 50 and the posterior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 46 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. Alternately, as shown and taught in FIG. 333, the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the upper 23 and thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the superior spring element 47 possibly including a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48.1 is inserted into the upper 23 and the inferior spring element 50 and anterior spring element 48.2 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. The physical and mechanical properties associated with various chambers 103 and portions of the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be homogenous, or alternately, can be heterogeneous and varied so as to provide different physical and mechanical properties in various select areas of the sole 32 of the article of footwear 22. For example, it can possibly be advantageous to reduce the stiffness of the lateral side of the sole 32 in the rearfoot area 68 and forefoot area 58 in a running shoe.
 FIG. 347 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 346, but including a number of differences.

In this regard, the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be affixed to the backing 30 present on the posterior outsole element 46 and the anterior outsole element 44. Alternately, as shown and taught in FIG. 332, the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can include an integral backing or web 114 portion including a flange 124 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the backing 30 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 or anterior outsole element 44 and can thereby be mechanically affixed in place when the inferior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 48.2 is inserted into the pocket 130 formed within either the posterior outsole element 46 or the anterior outsole element 50 and the posterior spring element 50 and/or the anterior spring element 46 are properly affixed in functional relation to the upper 23. The physical and mechanical properties associated with various chambers 103 and portions of the fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2 can be homogenous, or alternately, can be heterogeneous and varied so as to provide different physical and mechanical properties in various select areas of the sole 32 of the article of footwear 22. For example, it can possibly be advantageous to reduce the stiffness of the lateral side of the sole 32 in the rearfoot area 68 and forefoot area 58 in a running shoe.
 FIG. 349 is a lateral side 36 view of a shoe upper 23 mounted on a footwear last 80. The upper 23 can be made with the use conventional patterns, materials, and means known in the prior art, and can include openings 72 and possibly eyestays for accommodating laces and/or other conventional closure means. Shown is an upper 23 including a natural or synthetic textile material 137 such as a woven or knit fabric, and the like. It can be readily understood that the textile material 137 can consist of a circular knitted and/or three dimensional textile material, a multi-layer textile material, water resistant or waterproof materials, shape memory textile materials, or stretchable and elastic textile materials, and the like.
The textile material 137 included in the upper 23 can also be formed by circular knitting and/or three dimensional weaving or knitting methods known in the prior art related to the manufacture of socks, and a suitable pattern for use can be cut therefrom. Alternately, the textile material 137 forming at least a portion of the upper 23 can be made in the origami-like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,997 granted to Dieter, and assigned to Nike, Inc. and the like, or the shoe construction taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,251 granted to Litchfield et al. and assigned to Reebok International, Ltd., and the like, or the article of footwear taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al. also assigned to Reebok International, Ltd., and the like, all of these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
As shown in FIG. 349, the textile material 137 can be impregnated or over-molded with a plastic material 138 forming a stability element 136 d, e.g., a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, or polyethylene, or alternatively, an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems which have been previously recited, a foam thermoplastic material, a rubber material, or a polyurethane material, and the like. The textile material 137 can be impregnated or over-molded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., or alternately, while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last 80, mold, or the like. For example, stability element 136 d can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper 23.
Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper 23 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., assigned to Nike, Inc., and the like, the recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material 137 can possibly be impregnated or over-molded with the use of a spray, dipping, or roller application generally similar to that known in the screenprinting prior art. If the plastic material 138 is of the thermoplastic variety, it can then be caused to cool to take a set. Alternately, a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or over-mold the textile material 137 can be caused to cross-link by conventional means known in the prior art. It is also possible to use a thermoplastic material that is moldable when heated to a relatively low temperature, and a wearer can then put on the article of footwear 22 and cause the upper 23 to be molded to a desired shape before the thermoplastic material cools and sets. Moreover, as taught in the applicant's U.S. Ser. No. 09/570,171, filed May 11, 2000, light-cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 includes a plurality of openings 72 for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members 115 associated with the anterior outsole element 44 therethrough, it can be advantageous that the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 in the forefoot area 58, and possibly also that the midfoot area 67 and rearfoot area 68 be impregnated or over-molded by plastic material 138, or a suitable alternate material, or that the inferior side 38 otherwise be reinforced to enhance its structural integrity.
The upper 23 can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example, textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the trade name NATUREWORKSÂ® fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis, Minn. in corporation with the Kanebo Corporation associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka, Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials, but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear those derived form polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil for a period of two to three years.
 FIG. 350 is a lateral side 36 view of a shoe upper 23 that is generally similar to that shown in FIG. 349. However, as shown in FIG. 350, the upper 23 is made in general accordance with the so-called Huarache style commercialized by Nike, Inc. The textile material 137 can have elastic qualities, or alternatively, a rubber, neoprene foam rubber, polyurethane, or other material can be used in those areas of the vamp 52 and quarters 119 in which the location of a textile material 137 is indicated. In this regard, the textile material 137, or alternately, a substitute material having substantial elastic characteristics extends into the collar area 122 in order to facilitate entry and exit of a wearer's foot. Moreover, it can be readily understood that the upper 23 can include removable quarters including openings 72 for accommodating laces, straps 118, and/or other conventional closure means. The synergistic use of a textile material 137 or an alternate material having substantial elongation or elastic characteristics in combination with a relatively rigid thermoplastic material 138 or an alternate material having substantially less elongation or elastic characteristics in making the upper 23 can be coordinated to create select areas having different known and desired elongation characteristics in order to suitably accommodate or compliment a wearer's anatomical characteristics and biomechanical motions when engaged in activity. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,430 and also U.S. Pat. No. 6,367,168 B1 granted to Hatfield et al., and assigned to Nike, Inc., these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Alternately, the strap taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,319 granted to Parker et al. and assigned to Nike, Inc. can possibly be used, this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein. A portion of the strap 118.3 can pass about the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 and there be adjusted and removably affixed with the use of VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140, and also under the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 and there be at least partially mechanically affixed within the grooves or valleys 93 formed between adjacent traction members 115 as was shown in FIG. 356.
 FIG. 358 is a top plan view of a pattern for an upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 that is substantially formed in a single part. As shown, the upper 23 includes a textile material 137 and can be cut using an automatic cutting machine such as those made by the Eastman Company of Buffalo, N.Y. As previously discussed, the upper 23 can also be coated or over-molded with a thermoplastic material 138 to create reinforced areas, and this can be done either before or after the desired pattern is cut. The inferior side 38 of the upper 23 can include openings 72 for the passage of traction members therethrough, or alternately, can have traction members 115 directly affixed thereto, as shown in FIG. 360. The inferior side 38 be folded underneath in order to properly communicate with the medial, lateral, anterior and posterior portions of the upper 23 and be affixed in functional relation thereto with the use of conventional means such as stitching, adhesives, bonding, or welding such as radio frequency or sonic welding, and the like. The provision of an overlap area 141.1 can facilitate affixing the posterior sides 34 of the upper 23 together. Likewise the provision of an overlap area 141.2 on the inferior side 38 can facilitate affixing that portion in functional relation to the other portions of the upper 23. The overlap areas 141.1 and 141.2 can pass and therefore be visible within the interior of the upper 23, or alternately, on the exterior of the upper 23.

The angle and orientation of the pocket 131 included in the anterior spacer 55.2 can be selected from a variety of options for at least partially determining the amount of possible deflection and orientation of the anterior spring element 48.2. Further, the configuration of the inferior anterior spring element 48.2 and associated anterior outsole element 44 can be selected from a variety of options for partially determining the amount of possible deflection and orientation of the anterior spring element 48.2.
Moreover, the configuration and material composition of a posterior outsole element 46, middle outsole element 45, and anterior outsole element 44 can be selected from a variety of options which can be provided for optimizing performance in a specific activity, task, or in particular environmental conditions. For example, the outsole elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in running on roads, trails, racing, walking, or cross-training. An outsole element for trail running can include a greater number of traction members having greater height relative to one best suited for running on roads, whereas it can be advantageous for an outsole element intended for use in racing to be especially light-weight. Further, an outsole element intended for use on an artificial track surface can include a plurality of relatively small protrusions or spikes. Outsole elements which are made of non-marking materials can be provided that are especially suitable for use in basketball, whereas outsole elements including natural rubber, and the like, can be provided that are especially suitable for use in volleyball. Material compounds which are especially resistant to wear can be provided for use in tennis. Outsole elements including a plurality of cleats, protrusions, or traction elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in baseball, football, golf, and soccer, respectively. As shown in FIG. 394, an outsole element can accommodate the use of a bicycle cleat system. Outsole elements made of material compositions which are resistant to oil and other chemicals can be provided that are especially suitable for use in articles of footwear intended for work and industrial use.
 FIG. 413 is a top plan view of an inferior anterior spring element 48.2 positioned within an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 including a plurality of resilient semi-circular domes 143.

 FIG. 414 is a top plan view of an inferior anterior spring element 48.2 positioned within an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30. The backing 30 further includes a plurality of foam cushioning elements 135 affixed thereto. Accordingly, the foam cushioning elements 135 can provide cushioning means between the superior side of the inferior anterior spring element 48.2 and the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48.1.
 FIG. 415 is a top plan view of an inferior anterior spring element 48.2 positioned within an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30. The backing 30 can include an opening 72 for permitting a portion of a foam cushioning element 135 to project therethrough. As shown, the foam cushioning element 135 includes five columns which are made as a single integral component. Alternately, the column portions can be affixed to a thin web 114 having a generally planar configuration. In any case, the foam cushioning element 135 can include a flange 124 for retaining the columns in position. It can be readily understood that a foam cushioning element 135 can be made in a multiplicity of different configurations and shapes.
 FIG. 416 is a top plan view of an inferior anterior spring element 48.2 positioned within an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 including a plurality of openings 72 for permitting the projection of at least a portion of at least one fluid-filled bladder 101 therethrough. Alternately, the chambers 133 can be formed individually and be affixed in a desired configuration to a thin web 114 having a generally planar configuration. As shown, the fluid-filled bladder 101 includes three chambers 133 that are in fluid communication and form an integral component. Alternately, at least one fluid-filled bladder including valves that can serve as a motion control device can be used, as taught in WO 01/70061 A2 entitled âArticle of Footwear With A Motion Control Device, by John F. Swigart and assigned to Nike, Inc. Moreover, at least one fluid-filled bladder that forms part of a larger dynamically-controlled cushioning system can be used, as taught in WO 01/78539 A2 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,843 B1 entitled âDynamically-Controlled Cushioning System For An Article of Footwear,â by Daniel R. Potter and Allan M. Schrock, and assigned to Nike, Inc. Such an article of footwear can include at least one fluid-filled bladder including a plurality of chambers, a control system possibly including a central processing unit or CPU, a pressure detector, and a regulator for modulating the level of fluid communication between different fluid-filled bladders or chambers. Again, the patent applications recited in this paragraph have been previously incorporated by reference herein. In any case, the fluid-filled bladder 101 can include a flange 124 for retaining the chambers 133 in relative position, as shown in FIG. 416. It can be readily understood that a fluid-filled bladder 101 can be made in a multiplicity of different configurations and shapes.
 FIG. 417 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 including a middle outsole element 45.
 FIG. 418 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 including a middle outsole element 45 substantially consisting of fluid-filled bladder 101. As shown, the middle outsole element 45 substantially consisting of fluid-filled bladder 101 can include a wall 132 and a chamber 133, and be made of a material that is substantially transparent.
 FIG. 419 is a side exploded view of an article of footwear 22 including the middle outsole element 45 substantially consisting of the fluid-filled bladder 101 shown in FIG. 418. The posterior outsole element 46 is shown in position on the inferior spring element 50, whereas the middle outsole element 45, and the female portion 86 of a fastener 29 are shown separated. Accordingly, the middle outsole element 45 can be selectively removed and replaced, as desired.
 FIG. 420 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 including a middle outsole element 45 substantially consisting of a foam cushioning element 135. As shown, the foam cushioning element 135 can include dual density material, that is, a relatively soft material near the superior side, but a relatively hard wear resistant material or skin near the inferior side and ground engaging portion 53 of the outsole 43.
 FIG. 421 is a bottom plan view of the article of footwear 22 including a middle outsole element 45 substantially consisting of a fluid-filled bladder 101 shown in FIG. 418.

The amount of toe spring 62 incorporated into a footwear last 80 or other three dimensional rendering of a footwear configuration is commonly measured with the inferior side 38 of the area of the last 80 corresponding to the approximate position of the weight bearing center of a hypothetical wearer's heel being elevated such that the inferior side 38 of the rearfoot area 58 is approximately parallel to an underlying generally planar support surface. When so treading a last 80, the forefoot area of the last 80 will make contact at a position that is commonly called the tread point 144. It is common for the heel elevation 145 of a treaded last 80 to be in the range between 10-12 mm. When represented in 1/1 scale, the amount of toe spring 62 shown would measure approximately 20 mm.
 FIG. 424 is a side view of a footwear last 80 with parts broken away showing toe spring 62 that would measure approximately 10 mm when represented in 1/1 scale.
 FIG. 425 is a side view of a footwear last 80 with parts broken away showing toe spring 62 that would measure approximately 30 mm when represented in 1/1 scale. It can be advantageous to incorporate at least 10 mm of toe spring 62 into an article of footwear intended for running, but even 30 mm of toe spring 62 can sometimes be incorporated into track spikes intended for athletes running at high speeds.
 FIG. 426 is a side view of an upper 23 including a removable strap 118.3 including openings 72 for accommodating lace 121 closure means. Again, the strap 118.3 can be selectively removed and replaced, and secured between an inferior spring element 50 and the upper 23 with the use of a fastener 29.
 FIG. 427 is a side view of an upper 23 including a removable strap 118.3 including openings 72 for accommodating lace 121 closure means and also a strap portion encompassing the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 including VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means.
 FIG. 428 is a side view of an upper 23 including a removable strap 118.3 including VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means.
 FIG. 429 is a side view of an upper 23 including a removable strap 118.3 including VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means, and also a strap portion encompassing the posterior side of the upper 23 including VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means.
 FIG. 430 is a side view of an upper 23 including a removable strap 118.3 including openings 72 for accommodating lace 121 closure means and also a strap portion encompassing the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 including VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means.
 FIG. 431 is a bottom plan view showing a superior spring element 47 including a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 including a plurality of flex notches 71 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 316 positioned in functional relation within an upper 23, and showing a plurality of fasteners 29 for selectively adjusting the width and girth of the upper 23. Again, as discussed previously in connection with FIGS. 30-34, the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 can include a T-sock 56 made of a textile material 137 or other material having resilient elastic, stretch, or elongation physical properties and mechanical characteristics, and the relative position of various portions of the upper 23 can be adjusted and secured at a plurality of positions with the use of fasteners 29, as desired. Alternately, the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 can be made of a textile material 137 or other material which is also used on the superior side of the upper 23 having resilient elastic, stretch, or elongation physical properties and mechanical characteristics, and the relative position of various portions of the upper 23 can be adjusted and secured at a plurality of positions with the use of fasteners 29, as desired.
As shown, the fasteners 29 can be inserted through openings 72 in the inferior side of the upper 23 that also register with the longitudinal and transverse flex notches 71 associated with the anterior spring element 48. Accordingly, a given fastener 29 which is affixed to a portion of the inferior side 34 of the upper 23 can then simply be drawn inwards or outwards along the path of the corresponding longitudinal or transverse flex notch 71, and the upper 23 can then secured in a desired position.
 FIG. 432 is a bottom plan view of an anterior outsole element 44 including a hexagonal opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29. As shown, the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 can be made of a transparent material. When protrusions 99 which constitute male mating structures 128 are included on the superior side 37 of the backing 30 for the purpose of mechanically engaging with an overlaying anterior spring element 44, these male mating structures 128 can then be visible from the inferior side 38. In FIG. 432, the location of a length measurement that is taken between the center of opening 72 and the anterior side 33, and also the location of a transverse width measurement that extends along line 104 between the medial side 35 and lateral side 36 is also shown for possible use in an Internet website or a retail establishment.
 FIG. 433 is a bottom plan view of an anterior outsole element 44 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 432, but instead having a triangular opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29, and also having a different configuration near the posterior side 34. Further, the anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIG. 433 has a different overall configuration or last shape than the embodiment shown in FIG. 432, and also a different length size and width size. It can be readily understood that a specific anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 and possibly further including a stability element 136 can be selected for use from amongst a wide variety and range of different provided options. However, the configuration and pattern of the outsole 43 traction members 115 shown in FIG. 433 could not be used with the same upper 23 as that used in combination with the embodiment of the anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIG. 432. Again, an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 and possibly further including a stability element 136 can at least in part define the length size, width size, and configuration or last shape of an article of footwear 22 when inserted into an upper 23 including a textile material or other material having substantial elastic, stretch, or elongation physical properties and mechanical characteristics in at least a portion of the forefoot area 58.
 FIG. 434 is a bottom plan view of an anterior outsole element 44 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 432, but further including a plurality of flex notches 71 for enhancing flexibility. Further, the embodiment shown in FIG. 434 also includes a backing 30 that extends more substantially about the sides of the anterior outsole element 44 which is made of a thermoplastic material having a relatively low softening and melting point relative to the material used to made the outsole 43 traction members 115. Accordingly, the anterior outsole element 44 can be heated to a temperature associated with the softening point of the thermoplastic material used to make the backing 30, and the backing 30 and anterior outsole element 44 can then be easily molded to a desired shape with the application of direct pressure. In this regard, a vacuum forming apparatus and method can be used. For example, various alternate metal last shapes and sizes can be provided which can be heated by an apparatus to a desired temperature, and these metal last shapes can also include a plurality of vacuum ports for effectively drawing and molding the backing 30 of an anterior outsole element 44 to a selected and desired shape. The backing 30 portion can also be cut to a desired shape, and the opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29 can also made in a selected position which will determine at least in part the resulting length size of an article of footwear 22. In this way, a single embodiment of an anterior outsole element 44 can be readily adapted for use to make one of several different possible length sizes, width sizes, and last shapes, as desired.
 FIG. 435 is a bottom plan view of an anterior outsole element 44 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 433, but further including a plurality of flex notches 71 for enhancing flexibility. Further, the anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIG. 435 has a different overall configuration or last shape than the embodiment shown in FIG. 434, and also a different length size and width size. It can be readily understood that a specific anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 and possibly further including a stability element 136 can be selected for use from amongst a wide variety and range of different provided options. In contrast with the anterior outsole element 44 embodiment shown in FIG. 433, the configuration and pattern of the outsole 43 traction members 115 shown in FIG. 435 could possibly be used with the same upper 23 as that used in combination with the embodiments of the anterior outsole element 44 shown in FIGS. 432 and 434. Again, an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 and possibly further including a stability element 136 can at least in part define the length size, width size, and configuration or last shape of an article of footwear 22 when inserted into an upper 23 including a textile material or other material having substantial elastic, stretch, or elongation physical properties and mechanical characteristics in at least a portion of the forefoot area 58.
 FIG. 436 is a bottom plan view of an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 portion which can extend substantially full length between the anterior side 33 and the posterior side 34 of a corresponding upper 23 of an article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 437 is a bottom plan view of a gasket 142 for possible use between an anterior outsole element 44 and an upper 23. The gasket 142 can slip over a plurality of traction members 115 and be affixed to the relatively thin flange or backing 30 portion of an anterior outsole element 44. Accordingly, the gasket 142 can serve both to seal and affix the anterior outsole element 44 in functional relation to the upper 23. The gasket 142 can consist of a thin layer of double sided adhesive tape having protective peel-ply layers, or alternately a material having more substantial thickness such as a closed cell foam material including double sided adhesive surfaces having protective peel-ply layers. Accordingly, a gasket 142 can further include a self-adhesive surface 83 on both its superior side 37 and inferior side 38 that can be exposed by the removal of peel-ply layers 149. As shown, the peel-ply layer 149 on the inferior side 38 has already been removed.
 FIG. 438 is a side view of an anterior outsole element 44 having a generally planar configuration.
 FIG. 439 is a side view of an anterior outsole element 44 including an elevated stability element 136 having a three dimensional wrap configuration. This configuration can be advantageous for use in articles of footwear 22 intended for use in sports or activities requiring substantial lateral movement.

 FIG. 450 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a bladder 101, and a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 that are made as a single integral part. The superior side of the superior spring element 47 and that of a portion of the bladder 101 can be affixed by adhesive, chemical bonding, or other conventional means to the inferior side of the upper 23 as shown, or alternately to an intermediate material which is to affixed to the upper, e.g., a midsole made of foam material. The bladder 101 can be formed by injection molding, blow-molding, and the like, and can include an opening 72 in a portion of the anterior side and superior side for permitting a portion of the spring element 51 to be inserted and contained therein. Alternately, the bladder 101 can be formed by using a shrink-wrap thermoplastic material. In this case, a portion of the spring element 51 can be inserted into an oversized bladder 101 component, and the application of heat can cause the bladder 101 to shrink and substantially mold to the shape defined by the outer surfaces of the portion of the spring element 51 contained therein. As shown, a portion of the superior side of the superior spring element 47 can extend posterior of the inferior and posterior side of the upper 23 forming a generally planar configuration.
 FIG. 451 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 450 including a bladder 101, and a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 that are made separately, but later affixed together permanently to form a single integral part. The superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50 can be affixed by adhesives, chemical bonding, or other conventional means.
 FIG. 452 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 451 including a bladder 101, but also a selectively removable and replaceable inferior spring element 50. The inferior spring element 50, bladder 101, and posterior outsole element 46 can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of a fastener 29. As shown, the article of footwear 22 can include an internal heel counter 24, or alternately, an external heel counter. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 453 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 450 including a bladder 101, and a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 that are made as a single integral part. However, in contrast with the embodiment shown in FIG. 450, a portion of the superior side of the superior spring element 47 extends about the posterior side of the upper 23 forming a generally curved configuration.
 FIG. 454 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 452 including a bladder 101, but also a selectively removable and replaceable inferior spring element 50. The inferior spring element 50,
bladder 101, and posterior outsole element 46 can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of a fastener 29. However, in contrast with the embodiment shown in FIG. 452, a portion of the superior side of the superior spring element 47 extends about the posterior side of the upper 23 forming a generally curved configuration. As shown, the article of footwear 22 can include an internal heel counter 24, or alternately, an external heel counter. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 455 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 453 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 that are made as a single integral part. However, the embodiment shown in FIG. 455 does not include a bladder 101.
 FIG. 456 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 455. However, the embodiment shown in FIG. 456 includes a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50 that are made separately, and later bonded together to form a single integral part. Further, the superior spring element 47 can form an external heel counter 24, as shown.
 FIG. 457 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 454 including a selectively removable and replaceable inferior spring element 50, and posterior outsole element 46. However, the embodiment shown in FIG. 457 does not include a bladder 101, rather the superior spring element 47 forms an external heel counter 24. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 458 is a medial side view of an upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 including a strap 118.3 and a retainer 123 on the superior side 37. The strap 118.3 includes an opening 72 on the inferior side 38 for the passage of a fastener 29 therethrough, and can be selectively removed and replaced, as desired. The strap 118.3 can pass through an opening or slot in the retainer 123 on the superior side 37, and thereby be held in position. The retainer 123 can also includes a strap 118.2 forming a loop that can serve as a pull for facilitating entry and exit of a wearer's foot with respect to the shoe upper 23. Also shown is a strap 118.1 on the posterior side 34 forming a loop that can serve as a pull for facilitating entry and exit of a wearer's foot with respect to the shoe upper 23. The upper 23 can be made using one or more textile materials, and a multiplicity of patterns and styles are possible. When the upper 23 is made of a stretch material or a substantially elastic material, or one that otherwise has substantial elongation characteristics, the geometry and shape of the upper 23 can be substantially defined by the insertion of a superior spring element 47 possibly including an anatomically shaped heel counter 24, and also an anterior outsole element 46 including a stability element 136, as shown in FIG. 352. Alternately, when the upper 23 is made of a stretch material or a substantially elastic material, or one that otherwise has substantial elongation characteristics, the geometry and shape of the upper 23 can be substantially defined by affixing a superior spring element 47 including an anatomically shaped heel counter 24 and also an anterior outsole element 46 including a stability element 136 to the external side of the upper 23, as shown in FIG. 353. Accordingly, a relatively simple design and pattern can then be used to made an upper 23, and in particular, one that can be cut using automatic cutting machines, and also substantially sewn using automatic sewing machines, thus minimizing the cost of human labor and errors in making the upper 23. One maker and distributor of automatic sewing machines and associated technology is Schroeder Sewing Technologies of San Marcos, Calif. The aforementioned structures and methods can make it economically feasible to manufacture the upper 23 and associated article of footwear 22 in the particular host country of intended distribution such as the United States, that is, instead of making articles of footwear in Asia due to the presence of relatively inexpensive human labor costs there, as is present widespread practice throughout the footwear industry.
 FIG. 459 is a lateral side 36 view of the upper 23 of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 458. The portion of strap 118.3 which passes from the medial side 35 through the retainer 123 on the superior side 37 can be attached to a D-ring 150, and the portion of the strap 118.3 that extends upwards on the lateral side 36 can include male and female VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means.
 FIG. 460 is a medial side 35 view of an upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 including a strap 118.3 that is held in position by a retainer 123 on the superior side 37 which is generally similar to that shown in FIG. 458, but further including an integral strap portion that also encompasses the posterior side 34 of the upper 23.
 FIG. 461 is a lateral side 36 view of the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 460. Again, the portion of strap 118.3 which passes from the medial side 35 through the retainer 123 on the superior side 37 can be attached to a D-ring 150, and the portion of the strap 118.3 that extends upwards on the lateral side 36 can include male and female VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means. As shown, the strap 118.3 further includes an integral strap portion that also encompasses the posterior side 34 of the upper 23.
 FIG. 462 is a lateral side 36 view of the upper 23 of an article of footwear 22 including a strap 118.3 made from a resilient and elastic material. For example, the strap 118.3 can be made of a thermoplastic material or thermoset material which is resilient and elastomeric, thus capable of substantial elongation and recovery. The strap 118.3 includes an opening 72 on the inferior side 38 for the passage of a fastener 29 therethrough, and can be selectively removed and replaced, as desired. A multiplicity of different designs and styles of a resilient and elastomeric strap 118.3 are possible.
 FIG. 463 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 that includes two bladders 101.1 and 101.2, and a selectively removable and replaceable spring element 51. As shown, the wall 132 of bladder 101.1 overlaps the superior side of the superior spring element 47, and also the inferior side of the inferior spring element 50. The posterior outsole element 46 can be affixed directly to the wall 132 of the bladder 101.1. The article of footwear 22 can include an external heel counter 24, or an internal heel counter 24, as shown. With the use of a fastener 29 the upper 23 including the heel counter 24 can be mechanically affixed to the superior spring element 47, inferior spring element 50, and portions of the wall 132 of bladder 101.1. The bladder 101.1 can include an opening 72 near the anterior side, and/or a portion of the superior side for facilitating the insertion of portions of the superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50. As shown, the wall 132 of bladder 101.2 overlaps the superior side of the anterior spring element 48.1, and also the inferior side of the anterior spring element 48.2. The anterior outsole element 44 can be affixed directly to the wall 132 of the bladder 101.2. With the use of at least one fastener 29, the upper 23 can be mechanically affixed to the anterior spring element 48.1, anterior spring element 48.2, anterior spacer 55.2, and portions of the wall 132 of bladder 101.2. The bladder 101.2 can include an opening 72 near the posterior side, and/or a portion of the superior side for facilitating the insertion of portions of the anterior spring element 48.1 and anterior spring element 48.2. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 464 is a longitudinal cross-sectional lateral side 36 view of an article of footwear 22 that includes two bladders 101.1 and 101.2 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 463, but not including a plurality of fasteners 29, rather the various components are affixed by other conventional means such as the use of adhesives. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 465 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 306-307, including an upper 23 and strap 118.3, and also including selectively removable and replaceable components. As shown, the superior spring element 47 includes a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 466 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 465. As shown, substantially all of the various major components of the article of footwear 22 can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of a single fastener 29.
 FIG. 467 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIGS. 465-466.
 FIG. 468 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including an upper 23 and strap 118.3 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 458-459, and also including selectively removable and replaceable components. However, the upper 23 has been so configured as to accommodate the further inclusion of a midsole 26 in the forefoot area 58 within the upper 23.
 FIG. 469 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 468. As shown, the midsole 26 is located between the insole 31 and the anterior spring element 48, and can include at least one male mating structure 128 and/or female mating structure 129 for affixing the midsole 26 in functional relation to the insole 31 and/or anterior spring element 48. Again, the midsole 26 can be made of a cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a foam material, a fluid-filled bladder, and the like. The further introduction of a midsole 26 can serve to increase the amount of possible deflection and in some applications provide enhanced cushioning effects.
 FIG. 470 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIGS. 468-469.
 FIG. 471 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including an upper 23 and strap 118.3 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 458-459, and also including selectively removable and replaceable components. However, the upper 23 has been so configured as to accommodate the further inclusion of a midsole 26 in the forefoot area 58 within the upper 23.
 FIG. 472 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear shown in FIG. 471. As shown, the midsole 26 is located between the anterior spring element 48 and the web or backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44, and can include at least one male mating structure 128 and/or female mating structure 129 for affixing the midsole 26 in functional relation to the anterior spring element 48 and/or the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44. Again, the midsole 26 can be made of a cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a foam material, a fluid-filled bladder, and the like. The further introduction of a midsole 26. The further introduction of a midsole 26 can serve to increase the amount of possible deflection and in some applications provide enhanced cushioning effects.
 FIG. 473 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of portions of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIGS. 471-472.
 FIG. 474 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 including a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50, and having a flexural axis 59 located in the forefoot area 58. The flexural axis 59 can be orientated generally consistent with the transverse axis 91, that is, approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 69, or be orientated approximately in the range between 10-50 degrees. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 can be generally planar, or only slightly curved. Alternately, the inferior spring element 50 can be more substantially curved than shown in FIG. 474. As shown, the spring element 51 can be configured and engineered to provide a substantial amount of deflection approximately in the range between 10-50 mm, and can therefore store a substantial amount of energy for later use during the walking, jumping, or running cycle.
 FIG. 475 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 474. As shown, the spring element 51 can include a superior spring element 47 and an inferior spring element 50. The superior spring element 47 can be generally planar, thus substantially the entire length of the superior spring element 47 can bend and flex when loaded. Alternately, the superior spring element can further include an anterior spring element 48 and a posterior spring element 49. Closure means such as strap 118.3 can be affixed in functional relation to the upper 23 by mechanical engagement means such as a fastener 29. The superior spring element 47 can be selectively affixed in functional relation to the inferior spring element 50 by mechanical engagement means such as at least one fastener 29. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation. The sole 32 can include a backing 30 and outsole 43 which can also be selectively removed and replaced, as desired. Alternately, the superior spring element 47 can be affixed in functional relation to the exterior of the upper 23.
 FIG. 476 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 475, but the superior spring element 47 further includes an integral heel counter 24 in the rearfoot area 68. Accordingly, the superior spring element 47 would be relatively resistant to bending and flexing in the rearfoot area 68, and greater relative bending and flexing would take place in the midfoot area 67 and forefoot area 58. As shown, the insole 31 can be configured so as to extend beyond the superior edges of the superior spring element 47 in order to protect a wearer from direct contact therewith. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 477 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 475, but the superior spring element 47 further includes an integral heel counter 24 and extended side stabilizer in the rearfoot area 68, midfoot area 67, and also a portion of the forefoot area 58, that is, a position posterior of the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints. Accordingly, the superior spring element 47 would be relatively resistant to bending and flexing in the rearfoot area 68, midfoot area 67, and also a portion of the forefoot area 58, and greater relative bending and flexing would take place in the forefoot area 58 near, at, and anterior of a position associated with the approximate position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints. As shown, the insole 31 can be configured so as to extend beyond the superior edges of the superior spring element 47 in order to protect a wearer from direct contact therewith. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 478 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 474, but including an inferior spring element 50 having concave or downward curvature posterior of the flexural axis 59 and convex or upwards curvature near the posterior end of the inferior spring element 50. This configuration can enhance the overall performance of the spring element 51 in certain applications and athletic activities. As shown, the spring element 51 can be configured and engineered to provide a substantial amount of deflection approximately in the range between 10-50 mm, and can therefore store a substantial amount of energy for later use during the walking, jumping, or running cycle.
 FIG. 479 is a side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 478, but having a superior spring element 47 that is instead affixed in functional relation to the exterior of the upper 23. The superior spring element 47 can be affixed to the upper 23 with the use of conventional means such as adhesive, and the like. As shown, the superior spring element 47 can include an integral heel counter 24. The inferior spring element 50 can be selectively and removably affixed by mechanical means to a sole 32 including a web or backing 30 portion and an outsole 43, and also to an upper 23 including a superior spring element 47. Alternately, the superior spring element 47 can be affixed to the upper 23 with the use of removable mechanical engagement means, thus be selectively removable and replaceable, as shown in FIG. 480.
 FIG. 480 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 479, but the superior spring element 47 is not affixed to the upper 23 by adhesive means. The article of footwear 22 further includes an internal stability element 136 that can at least partially define the configuration or shape of portions of the upper 23, and also an anterior spacer 55 for use between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50. When the components of the article of footwear 22 are assembled with the use of at least one fastener 29, a portion of the upper 23 can thereby be secured between the stability element 136 and the superior spring element 47. Accordingly, similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 476, substantially all of the components of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 480 are selectively removable and replaceable. As shown, a fastener 29 can be recessed and thereby not protrude from the surface of a component into which it is inserted. Again, a superior spring element 47 can alternately consist of a posterior spring element 49 and an anterior spring element 48 which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.
 FIG. 481 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 480, but the superior spring element 47 instead includes an integral heel counter 24 that is located only in the rearfoot area 68, and the anterior spacer 55 for use between the superior spring element 47 and the inferior spring element 50 is gently rounded near its posterior side. The gently rounded shape of the posterior side of the anterior spacer 55 can help to prevent high local point loads from being placed on the superior spring element 47 and inferior spring element 50, that is, as compared with an anterior spacer 55 having a triangular shape near its posterior side. Further, the use of an anterior spacer 55 which is resilient and elastomeric, such as one made of rubber, polyurethane, or a thermoplastic elastomer, can also serve to avoid the introduction of high local point loads. Similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 480, when the components of the article of footwear 22 are assembled with the use of at least one fastener 29, a portion of the upper 23 can thereby be secured between the stability element 136 and the superior spring element 47. Accordingly, similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 480, substantially all of the components of the article of footwear 22 are selectively removable and replaceable.
 FIG. 482 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including two fluid-filled bladders 101.1 and 101.2, and an outsole 43 that extends substantially full length between the posterior side 34 and the anterior side 33 of the article of footwear 22. As shown, the various components of the article of footwear 22 can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of at least one fastener 29. Alternately, the components of the article of footwear 22 could be affixed in functional relation by conventional means such as the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 483 is a longitudinal side cross-sectional view of an article of footwear 22 including a plurality of foam cushioning elements 135, and an outsole 43 that extends substantially full length between the posterior side 34 and the anterior side 33 of the article of footwear 22. As shown, the various components of the article of footwear 22 can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of at least one fastener 29. Alternately, the components of the article of footwear 22 could be affixed in functional relation by conventional means such as the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 484 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 between the upper 23 and superior side of the spring element 51 in the rearfoot area 68, and also between the inferior side of the spring element 51 and the outsole 43 in the forefoot area 58. As shown, the components of the article of footwear 22 can be affixed in functional relation by conventional means with the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 485 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 between the upper 23 and superior side of the spring element 51 in the rearfoot area 68, midfoot area 67, and forefoot area 58, and also between the inferior side of the spring element 51 and the outsole 43 in the forefoot area 58. As shown, the components of the article of footwear 22 can be affixed in functional relation by conventional means with the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 486 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 between the upper 23 and superior side of the spring element 51 in the rearfoot area 68, midfoot area 67, and forefoot area 58. As shown, the components of the article of footwear 22 can be affixed in functional relation by conventional means with the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 487 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including a midsole 26 in the forefoot area 58 between the inferior side of the spring element 51 and the outsole 43. As shown, the components of the article of footwear 22 can be affixed in functional relation by conventional means with the use of adhesives.
 FIG. 488 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of a boot 22 including a spring element 51 with parts broken away. Shown is an embodiment of a boot that is particularly suitable for use by the armed forces. The spring element 51 can be made of carbon fiber composite material, a spring grade titanium such as â15-3â made by TIMETÂ®, Titanium Metals Corporation of 403 Ryder Avenue, Vallejo, Calif. 94590, or a combination of both materials. When maximum weight reduction is desired, the spring element 51 can be made of carbon fiber composite material. However, when maximum protection against explosive devices such as land mines or enemy fire is desired, the spring element 51 can be made at least in part of spring grade titanium material.
For example, given a man of average body weight, the anterior spring element 48 can be made of â15-3â spring grade titanium having a thickness of approximately 1.6 mm, the posterior spring element 49 can be made of a carbon fiber composite material formed in an anatomical three dimension shape including an integral heel counter 24, and the inferior spring element 50 can be made of â15-3â spring grade titanium having a thickness approximately in the range between 3.5-4.5 mm. Accordingly, substantially the entire plantar side of a wearer's foot can thereby be shielded by a layer of spring grade titanium. The insole 31 can extend upwards in the area corresponding to a wearer's arches and encompass the rearfoot area 68 in order to shield a wearer's foot from direct contact with the heel counter 24 and enhance fit. As shown, the posterior spring element 49 can overlap a portion of the anterior spring element 48 that in turn can overlap a substantial portion of the backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44. The generally planar web portion 114 of the sole 32 can be direct injection molded to the inferior side 38 of the upper 23. However, the web portion 114 can include a plurality of openings 72 for permitting the traction members 115 associated with the anterior outsole element 44 to pass therethrough. Alternately, the traction members 115 and sole 32 in forefoot area 58 can be formed as an integral unit by direct injection molding, that is, in a conventional manner. When the generally planar web portion 114 of the sole 32 is made of a resilient and elastomeric material such as a thermoplastic or thermoset natural or synthetic rubber, and the web portion 114 also has a substantial thickness that perhaps approximates one quarter inch, then it can be advantageous for overall performance to at least partially encapsulate a metal insert 95 including an opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29 in the sole 32 during the direction injection molding process. A full-hex blind threaded insert made by Atlas Engineering, Inc. similar to that shown in FIG. 489 can be used as the female part 86 of the fastener 29, and the male part 85 of the fastener 29 can consist of a bolt having a flat head including an Allen or star drive such as those made by Stayfast Products, Inc., and having its threads coated with nylon to serve as a self-locking mechanism.
The thickness and stiffness of the anterior spring element 48, posterior spring element 49, and inferior spring element 50 can be selected from a variety and range of options in order to provide optimal performance depending upon whether an individual is walking, running, or possibly carrying a heavy pack. Further, the ground engaging portion 53 of the anterior outsole element 44 and also the posterior outsole element 46 can be selected from a variety and range of options with respect to their specific physical and mechanical properties and material composition. For example, a relatively soft material providing superior cushioning characteristic could be selected for use when drilling or running on asphalt, whereas a material having a wettability index of equal to or greater than 90 degrees, that is, hydrophobic properties could be selected for use in muddy conditions. Further, a material that is hydrophilic and porous could be suitable for use in snow or slippery conditions. In brief, the configuration of the traction elements 115 and their material composition can be selected for the specific anticipated or required task, terrain, and weather conditions. In less than one minute, the article of footwear 22 can be completely disassembled and re-assembled and any selected components then be replaced. Accordingly, the present invention can provide versatility and superior performance to members of the armed forces.
 FIG. 489 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including an anterior outsole element 44 and also a posterior outsole element 46 including a web portion 114. In this embodiment of an article of footwear 22, the anterior outsole element 44 and the posterior outsole element 46 do not include a separate backing 30, rather, an integral web portion 114 made of the same material which is used to make the outsole 43 and traction members 115.
 FIG. 490 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 489.
 FIG. 491 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including an anterior outsole element 44 having traction members 115 including an undercut 154 portion. The individual traction members 115 can include an undercut 154 portion about their perimeter that matches the size of the corresponding registered openings 72 which are present in the upper 23. The traction members 115 can then overlap and effectively seal the openings 72, and the anterior outsole element 44 can be snap-fitted and mechanically locked in place when the traction members 115 of the anterior outsole element 44 are properly inserted through the upper 23. Accordingly, the article of footwear 22 can include the structures disclosed and illustrated in the drawing figures of U.S. Pat. No. 6,915,596 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/134,112 published as US 2005/0210705 by Grove et al. assigned to Nike, Inc., both of these patent documents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.
 FIG. 492 is an exploded longitudinal cross-sectional side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 491.
 FIG. 493 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including an anterior outsole element 44 including a web 114 portion that is affixed to the exterior of the upper 23. In this embodiment, the anterior outsole element 44 including a web 114 portion can possibly be affixed to the exterior of the upper 23 with the use of adhesives, and in particular, the use of a protective peel-ply layer 149 which can be removed to expose a self-adhesive surface 100, or alternately, with the use of VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140, bonding, welding, or other conventional means.
 FIG. 494 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an article of footwear 22 including an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 that is affixed to the exterior of the upper 23. In this embodiment, the anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 can possibly be affixed to the exterior of the upper 23 with the use of adhesives, and in particular, the use of a protective peel-ply layer 149 which can be removed to expose a self-adhesive surface 100, or alternately, with the use of VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140, bonding, welding, or other conventional means.
 FIG. 495 shows multiple views of a prior art snap rivet 151 made by Richco, Inc. of Chicago, Ill. The snap rivet 151 can be installed by inserting the inferior portion into an opening and applying direct pressure to the superior portion. A snap rivet 151 can possibly be used as a fastener 29 when it is desired to adjust the width and girth of an article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 496 shows multiple views of a prior art push rivet 152 made by Richco, Inc. of Chicago, Ill. The push rivet 152 can be installed by inserting the inferior portion into an opening, and applying direct pressure to the superior pin portion. A push rivet 152 can possibly be used as a fastener 29 when it is desired to adjust the width and girth of an article of footwear 22.
 FIG. 497 shows a perspective view of a prior art full-hex blind threaded insert. FIG. 498 shows a side view of the prior art full-hex blind threaded insert shown in FIG. 497. FIG. 499 shows a top view of the prior art full-hex blind threaded insert shown in FIG. 497. FIGS. 497-99 show multiple views of a prior art full-hex blind threaded insert made by Atlas Engineering, Inc. of Kent, Ohio which can be used as a female part 86 of a fastener 29. When a single female part 86 of a metal fastener 29 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 497-499 is being used to affix the components of an article of footwear 22 together, the approximate A dimension as indicated in FIG. 498 will vary in accordance with the width of the superior spring element, upper, and inferior spring element, but will generally be in the range between 5-20 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 8-12 mm. Further, the approximate B dimension as indicated in FIG. 498 will generally be in the range between 1.0-2.0 mm. In addition, the approximate C dimension as indicated in FIG. 498 will generally be in the range between 8-25 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 10-20 mm. Moreover, the approximate D dimension as indicated in FIG. 499 will generally be in the range of 5-15 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 8-12 mm. The required size of the threaded opening is normally in the range between Â¼th and Â½ inch, thus 5/16ths of an inch can generally be used.
 FIG. 500 is a perspective view of a bolt or male part 85 of a fastener 29 for possible use with the female part 86 of a fastener 29 that is shown in FIGS. 497-499. As shown, the male part 85 can include an Allen head, or other mechanical engagement means, whereby the male part 85 and female part 86 of the fastener 29 can be secured together to a desired torque value. The required size of the threaded portion of the male part 85 is generally in the range between Â¼th and Â½ inch, thus 5/16ths of an inch can generally be used. The bolt or male part 85 can include a thin plastic coating 138 for preventing it from becoming accidentally loosened.
 FIG. 501 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a three quarter length superior spring element 47 and external heel counter 24. The heel counter 24 can be made of a glass or carbon fiber composite material, or alternately, a thermoplastic material reinforced with short or long fibers which is substantially rigid. For example, Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich. makes SPECTRUMÂ® reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts, and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton, Pa. makes THERMOCOMPÂ® and VERTONÂ® thermoplastic materials which can include long carbon fibers. The inferior spring element 50 is symmetrical in curvature on both the medial side 35 and lateral side 36. However, it can be advantageous for providing rearfoot stability during running for the flexural axis 59 to be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees, and in particular, 20-30 degrees. Given the configuration shown in FIG. 501, the overall length of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 article of footwear can be approximately in the range between 120-130 mm, and the approximate width can be in the range between 70-80 mm at the widest portion. In this embodiment, the approximate required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 is generally in the range between 4-8 mm, and the inferior spring element 50 is configured to provide deflection approximately in the range between 10-15 mm.
 FIG. 502 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a full length superior spring element 47 and external heel counter 24. As shown, the heel counter 24 can include a recess on the inferior side 38 for accommodating the anterior portion of the inferior spring element 50. Also shown in dashed lines is a fastener 29 for affixing the posterior portion of the superior spring element 47 in functional relation to the external heel counter 24.
 FIG. 503 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a full length superior spring element 47. The superior spring element 47 can further include an anterior spring element 48, and also a posterior spring element having an anatomical three dimensional cupped shape. The configuration of the superior spring element 47 or posterior spring element 49 in the rearfoot area can mate with that of the external heel counter 24. For example, mechanical engagement means such as mating male and female element can be included in the configuration of the superior spring element 47 and external heel counter 24.
 FIG. 504 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 similar to that shown with dashed lines in FIG. 502 for use in an article of footwear 22. Shown are the longitudinal axis 69, transverse axis 91, flexural axis 59, a line 104 indicating the approximate relative position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of a hypothetical wearer, openings 72 for accommodating at least one fastener 29, and a plurality of flex notches 71.
 FIG. 505 is a top plan view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIGS. 501-503 for possible use with a superior spring element 47 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 504. Shown are the longitudinal axis 69, transverse axis 91, flexural axis 59, and openings 72 for accommodating at least one fastener 29. Given the configuration shown in FIG. 505, the overall length of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 article of footwear can be approximately in the range between 120-130 mm, and the approximate width can be in the range between 70-80 mm at the widest portion. In this embodiment, the approximate required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 is generally in the range between 4-8 mm, and the inferior spring element 50 is configured to provide deflection approximately in the range between 10-15 mm.
 FIG. 506 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a three quarter length superior spring element 47, and an inferior spring element 50 that extends rearward substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23. Alternately, the inferior spring element 50 could possibly not extend so substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23 in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 506-510, and 519, rather, the posterior side of the inferior spring element 50 could be located approximately adjacent or consistent with the posterior side 34 of the upper 23, that is, along the vertical or z axis. The inferior spring element 50 is symmetrical in curvature on both the medial side 35 and lateral side 36. However, it can be advantageous for providing rearfoot stability during running for the flexural axis 59 to be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees, and in particular, 20-30 degrees. The inferior spring element 50 has greater length than the embodiment previously shown in FIG. 501. Given the configuration shown in FIG. 506, the overall length of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 article of footwear can be approximately in the range between 150-160 mm, and the approximate width can be in the range between 70-80 mm at the widest portion. In this embodiment, the approximate required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 is generally in the range between 5-10 mm, and the inferior spring element 50 is configured to provide more substantial deflection approximately in the range between 20-25 mm. Further, the forefoot area of this embodiment also includes a more substantial midsole 26 including foam material 134.
 FIG. 507 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a full length superior spring element 47, and an inferior spring element 50 that extends rearward substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23. This embodiment is generally similar in many respects to that shown in FIG. 506, but the midsole 26 and outsole 43 associated with the forefoot area extends further towards the posterior side 34 to at least partially surround the anterior side of the inferior spring element 50. This can provide more support to the midfoot area, and also facilitate a smoother transition during walking or running activity.
 FIG. 508 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a full length superior spring element 47 including an anatomical three dimensional cupped shape, a fluid-filled bladder 101, and an inferior spring element 50 that extends rearward substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23. This embodiment is generally similar in many respects to that shown in FIG. 507, but the midsole 26 and outsole 43 associated with the forefoot area extends even further towards the posterior side 34 and more substantially beneath the inferior spring element 50. This can provide more support to the midfoot area, and also facilitate a smoother transition during walking or running activity. The midsole 26 also includes a fluid-filled bladder 101 including a wall 132 and at least one chamber 133 as taught in the recited patents and patent applications that have been previously incorporated by reference herein. In particular, at least one fluid-filled bladder including valves that can serve as a motion control device can be used, as taught in WO 01/70061 A2 entitled âArticle of Footwear With A Motion Control Device, by John F. Swigart and assigned to Nike, Inc. Moreover, at least one fluid-filled bladder that forms part of a larger dynamically-controlled cushioning system can be used, as taught in WO 01/78539 A2 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,843 B1 entitled âDynamically-Controlled Cushioning System For An Article of Footwear,â by Daniel R. Potter and Allan M. Schrock, and assigned to Nike, Inc. Such an article of footwear can include at least one fluid-filled bladder including a plurality of chambers, a control system possibly including a central processing unit or CPU, a pressure detector, and a regulator for modulating the level of fluid communication between different fluid-filled bladders or chambers. It can be readily understood and is hereby explicitly stated that the teachings associated with the patents and patent applications relating to fluid-filled bladders that have been recited and previously incorporated by reference herein can be used in synergistic combination with any or all of the embodiments of an article of footwear taught in the present application.
 FIG. 509 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a fluid-filled bladder 101 which extends between the midfoot and forefoot areas, and an inferior spring element 50 that extends rearward substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23. This embodiment is generally similar in many respects to that shown in FIG. 508, but the fluid-filled bladder 101 is larger and extends substantially into the forefoot area anterior of the approximate location of the average wearer's first metatarsal-phalangeal joint 88.
 FIG. 510 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including a removable and replaceable middle outsole element 45 or stabilizer 63 which is affixed to a fluid-filled bladder 101 that is removable therewith, and an inferior spring element 50 that extends rearward substantially beyond the posterior side 34 of the upper 23. The stiffness in compression and other physical and mechanical properties of the middle outsole element 45 can thereby be selected from a variety of different options provided to a customer, and the performance of the article of footwear can be customized for an individual wearer.
 FIG. 511 is a top plan view of a superior spring element for possible use in an article of footwear generally similar to that shown in FIG. 507. Also shown are the longitudinal axis 69, transverse axis 91, flexural axis 59, and at least one opening 72 for accommodating at least one fastener 29. Again, it can be advantageous for providing rearfoot stability during running for the flexural axis 59 to be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 10-50 degrees, and in particular, 20-30 degrees. As result, and as previously discussed, the length of the effective lever arm on the medial side 35 of the inferior spring element 50 will be shorter than that on the lateral side 36, that is, as measured between the posterior side of the inferior spring element 50 and the location of the flexural axis 59 on each respective side. One way of expressing the length differential of the effective lever arms of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 versus the lateral side 36 is with a ratio, as taught by Herr et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,374, this patent having been previously incorporated by reference herein. In this regard, it can be advantageous for effecting rearfoot stability that the ratio of the length of the effective lever arms on the lateral side 36 relative to those on the medial side 35 be in the range between 1/1 to 2/1, and in particular, in the range between 1.25/1 to 2/1, and preferably in the range between 1.25/1 to 1.75/1.
 FIG. 512 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 including flex notches 71 on the lateral side 36 for possible use in an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 507. Given the sometimes dramatic curvature of a superior spring element 47 towards the medial side 35 in an article of footwear 22 having a curved or semi-curve lasted configuration, a superior spring element 47 made of a relatively homogenous carbon fiber composite material will commonly exhibit greater stiffness in bending on the lateral side 36 relative to the medial side 35. All things being equal, the straighter the last and corresponding configuration of the superior spring element 47, the less the stiffness differential, and conversely, the more curved the last and corresponding configuration of the superior spring element 47, the greater the stiffness differential. Accordingly, it can sometimes be advantageous to introduce flex notches 71 that are longer, or more numerous on the lateral side 36 versus the medial side 35 in order to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the stiffness differential. As previously discussed, it can sometimes be advantageous to create a âforefoot strike zone,â that is, an area of relatively reduced stiffness in compression, torsional stiffness, and stiffness in bending on the lateral side 36 near the position normally associated with the average wearer's fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint 89.
 FIG. 513 is a top plan view of a three quarter length superior spring element 47 including flex notches 71 on the lateral side 36 for possible use in the articles of footwear shown 22 in FIGS. 501 and 506.
 FIG. 514 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 including flex notches 71 on the lateral side 36 resembling those shown in FIG. 512, but also including two less substantial flex notches 71 on the medial side. The superior spring element 47 also includes an anatomical three dimensional cupped shape for conforming to a wearer's heel in the rearfoot area. This configuration can be used the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 508. When the side profile of a three dimensional cupped shape in the rearfoot area is sufficiently elevated, it can form an internal or external heel counter 24.
 FIG. 515 is a top plan view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIGS. 506-510, and 519. Shown is the longitudinal axis 69, transverse axis 91, flexural axis 59, and at least one opening 72 for accommodating at least one fastener 29. Given the configuration shown in FIG. 515, the overall length of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 article of footwear can be approximately in the range between 150-160 mm, and the approximate width can be in the range between 70-80 mm at the widest portion. In this embodiment, the approximate required thickness of the inferior spring element 50 for a men's size 9 is generally in the range between 5-10 mm, and the inferior spring element 50 is configured to provide more substantial deflection approximately in the range between 20-25 mm.
 FIG. 516 is an enlarged medial side view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 515. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 is made of a relatively homogenous construction including carbon fiber composite material.
 FIG. 517 is a medial side view of an alternate inferior spring element 50 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 515-516, but including a laminate structure. In particular, the inferior spring element 50 includes a laminate 155 made of carbon fiber composite material, or the like, on the opposing superior side 37 and inferior side 38, whereas the core can be made of a different material, e.g., foam, rubber, wood, thermoplastic, resin, epoxy, fiberglass, carbon fiber composite, or polyurethane material. In particular, when the thickness of a spring element is greater than approximately 5 mm, a laminate construction can sometimes be used to reduce the weight and cost of an inferior spring element 50, as well as to enhance its performance characteristics.
 FIG. 518 is a medial side view of an alternate inferior spring element 50 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 517, but including a laminate structure and having a gradually tapered configuration near the posterior side. As shown, the laminations 155 on the superior side 37 and inferior side 38 converge and directly overlap one another near the posterior side 34. The introduction of a tapered configuration can effectively reduce the exhibited stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 near the posterior side 34, and thereby serve to decrease the peak vertical force and shock associated with footstrike. A tapered configuration can also possibly serve to more evenly distribute loads throughout the inferior spring element 50.
 FIG. 519 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 510, but also including a fluid-filled bladder 101 between the inferior side of the upper 23 and superior side of the inferior spring element 50. The fluid-filled bladder 101 portion substantially located on the superior side of the inferior spring element 50, or upper portion, can be in fluid communication with that portion substantially located on the inferior side of the inferior spring element 50, or lower portion. When the inferior spring element 50 is caused to deflect upwards upon footstrike, the resulting increase in fluid pressure in the upper portion of the fluid-filled bladder 101 can be intelligently directed to the lower portion, and in particular, towards the medial side thereof in order to increase the local stiffness in an optimal manner. Again, at least one fluid-filled bladder including valves that can serve as a motion control device can be used, as taught in WO 01/70061 A2 entitled âArticle of Footwear With A Motion Control Device, by John F. Swigart and assigned to Nike, Inc. Moreover, at least one fluid-filled bladder that forms part of a larger dynamically-controlled cushioning system can be used, as taught in WO 01/78539 A2 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,843 B1 entitled âDynamically-Controlled Cushioning System For An Article of Footwear,â by Daniel R. Potter and Allan M. Schrock, and assigned to Nike, Inc. Such an article of footwear can include at least one fluid-filled bladder including a plurality of chambers, a control system possibly including a central processing unit or CPU, a pressure detector, and a regulator for modulating the level of fluid communication between different fluid-filled bladders or chambers. Again, the patent applications recited in this paragraph have been previously incorporated by reference herein.
 FIG. 520 is a side view of an engineering drawing of an inferior spring element 50. Shown are the anterior side 33, posterior side 34, superior side 37, inferior side 38, medial side 35, lateral side 36, an opening 72 for accommodating a fastener 29, the anterior portion 157, middle portion 158, posterior portion 159, anterior tangent point 160, posterior tangent point 161, anterior curve 162, thickness 164, and the symmetrical fitted radius of curvature 163. In this embodiment the dimensions are approximately as follows: the overall length of the inferior spring element is 4.75 inches; the length of the anterior portion 157 is 0.815 inches; the length of the middle portion is 2.435 inches; the length of the posterior portion is 1.5 inches; the thickness is 0.1476 inches; the vertical distance between the inferior side of the anterior portion 157 and inferior side of the posterior portion 159 adjacent the posterior tangent point 161 is 0.1476 inches, and the symmetrical fitted radius of curvature 163 is 2.5107. In this particular embodiment, the posterior portion 159 of the inferior spring element 50 is relatively flat or planar. When given an anterior tangent point 160 and a posterior tangent point 161 separated by a given horizontal or anterior to posterior distance, and also by a given vertical or superior to inferior distance, there can be only one radius of curvature that can be drawn from both tangent points 160 and 161 that will define a smooth curve having perfect symmetry that will intersect both tangent points 160 and 161. This single possible solution having perfect symmetry regarding the radius of curvature is hereby defined herein as the symmetrical fitted radius of curvature 163. It can be advantageous to design and configure an inferior spring element 50 using a symmetrical fitted radius of curvature 163 since this can result in the creation of a component in which the forces and loads placed upon it are most evenly distributed throughout the middle portion 158 including the anterior curve 162. This can contribute to mechanical properties that could possibly be considered advantageous, e.g., the degree to which the stress/strain curve is linear, that is, the degree to which the exhibited stiffness of the inferior spring element 50 is said to be stacked when loaded. Moreover, it can also possibly contribute to the robustness and service life of the inferior spring element 50.
 FIG. 521 is a side view of an engineering drawing of an inferior spring element 50 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 520, but having an upwardly inclined 165 posterior portion 159. As shown, the posterior portion 159 of the inferior spring element 50 is inclined 165 upwards at a 2 degree angle starting at the posterior tangent point 161 and extending to the posterior side 34 thereby creating an inclined posterior portion 159. When the inferior spring element 50 is affixed in functional relation to an article of footwear 22, this inclined 165 configuration can possibly be advantageous for reducing an undesirable leverage effect that can be generated near the lateral posterior corner of the inferior spring element 50 during footstrike and the braking phase of the gait cycle, as previously discussed above in this specification.
 FIG. 522 is a side view of an engineering drawing of an inferior spring element 50 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 520, but having a posterior portion 159 including a posterior curve 166. Accordingly, the inferior spring element 50 has an anterior curve 162 formed between the anterior tangent point 160 and the posterior tangent point 161, but also a posterior curve 166 formed between the posterior tangent point 161 and the posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50. Depending upon the configuration and overall geometry of the associated article of footwear, the radius of curvature could possibly be the same for both the anterior curve 162 and posterior curve 166. Alternately, the posterior curve 166 could have a greater radius of curvature, but generally the posterior curve 166 will have a lesser radius of curvature than that of the anterior curve 162. However, much depends upon the configuration and overall geometry of the associated article of footwear, and in particular, the design and configuration of the outsole in the rearfoot area.
 FIG. 523 is a top plan view of an inferior spring element 50 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 505 and 520, but showing several features of the inferior spring element 50 in greater detail. In particular, shown are the anterior portion 157, middle portion 158, posterior portion 159, anterior tangent point 160, posterior tangent point 161, anterior curve 162, and posterior curve 166.
 FIG. 524 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including an external heel counter 24, and a spring element 51 including a superior spring element 47 shown with phantom dashed lines and an inferior spring element 50 having a tapered configuration. Again, an external heel counter can be made of a thermoset fiber composite material possibly including glass, aramide, carbon, or boron fibers, or alternately be made of a reinforced thermoplastic material including short or long fibers. For example, Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich. makes SPECTRUMÂ® reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts, and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton, Pa. makes THERMOCOMPÂ® and VERTONÂ® thermoplastic materials which can include glass or carbon fibers. When the superior spring element 47 is affixed to the external heel counter 24 and the inferior spring element 50 with the use of a fastener 29, the posterior portion of the upper 23 is trapped between the superior spring element 47 and the external heel counter 24 and thereby affixed and secured in functional relation thereto. In this embodiment, nearly all of the deflection in the rearfoot area 68 will be provided by the inferior spring element 50, that is, the portion of the superior spring element 47 which overlaps the external heel counter 24 will not substantially flex during use.
 FIG. 525 is a medial side view of the article of footwear shown in FIG. 524 showing the shorter relative effective length of the lever arm of the inferior spring element 50 on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36, and also the tapered configuration of the inferior spring element 50.
 FIG. 526 is a side view engineering drawing showing the dimensions of an inferior spring element 50 for possible use with a men's size 9 article of footwear such as that shown in FIGS. 524 and 525. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 has an overall length of 5.5 inches, and the anterior portion 157 can measure 1.25 inches, the middle portion 158 can measure 2.5 inches, and the posterior portion 159 can measure 1.75 inches. Alternately, the overall length can be reduced by 0.25 inch by subtracting 0.125 inches from both the anterior portion 157 and the posterior portion 159. As shown, the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 of the anterior curve 162 has a radius of 2.845 inches, whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side 37 of the posterior curve 166 is 9.0 inches, and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side 38 of the posterior portion 159 is 5.138 inches. As shown, the vertical distance between the highest and lowest elevation is 0.7085 inches or 18 mm, and the thickness of the particular inferior spring element 50 shown is 0.1970 inches or 5 mm at the anterior side 33 and tapering to only 0.108 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side 34. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight, running technique, or characteristic running speeds, and also for use in many different activities. If and when desired, the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10-18 mm, something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 associated with the anterior curve 162 to also change, but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. Generally, regarding a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches, the width in the range between 75-85 mm, the vertical distance between the highest and lowest elevation is in the range between 10-18 mm, and the thickness is in the range between 4-5.5 mm at the anterior side 33 and in the range between approximately 2-3 mm at the posterior side 34. Generally, an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 for use in a men's size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve 162 is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches, an advantageous radius of curvature 181 with respect to the superior side 37 of the posterior curve 166 is in the range between 7 and 11 inches, and an advantageous radius of curvature 182 regarding the inferior side 38 of the posterior portion 159 is in the range between 4-6 inches.
 FIG. 527 is a bottom plan view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIGS. 524 and 525, also showing an opening 72 and the bottom side of a wear prevention insert 130 inserted therein.
 FIG. 528 is a rear view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 524 and 525, showing the posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 and its tapered configuration, but also a posterior outsole element 46 including a transparent backing 30.
 FIG. 529 is a front view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 527.
 FIG. 530 is a top plan view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 527. As shown, the flexural axis 59 is deviated from the transverse axis 91 of the inferior spring element 50 by approximately 20 degrees. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running, given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown, it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis 59 to be deviated from the transverse axis 91 in the range between 20-30 degrees. Further, in a running shoe application it is also generally advantageous to introduce a tapered configuration at least within the posterior portion 159 of the inferior spring element 50. Also shown is the top side of a wear prevention insert 130 further including splines 167 for mating with complimentary splines on another wear prevention insert which can be inserted into the bottom side of an external heel counter. Accordingly, the inferior spring element 50 can be secured to an external heel counter in various positions by merely rotating it by a desired angular increment, thereby adjusting the overall configuration and both the cushioning and stability characteristics of an article of footwear.
 FIG. 531 is a bottom plan view of the external heel counter 24 shown in FIGS. 524, 525 and 528, and also showing a wear prevention insert 130 including splines 167 for mating with the complementary wear prevention insert 130 shown in FIG. 530. Further, the longitudinal axis 69 is shown, as well as lines associated with angular deviations of 5 and 10 degrees towards the medial side 35 and also towards the lateral side 36. When an inferior spring element 50 is secured to the external heel counter 24 and/or superior spring element 47 the amount of angular deviation, if any, can be selected as desired. Generally, the maximum amount of angular deviation that is required in order to accommodate wearer's having varying anatomy and biomechanics is less than or equal to 20 degrees, that is, the sum of 10 degrees deviation to the medial side 35 and also to the lateral side 36. More commonly, less than or equal to a total of 15 degrees of angular deviation, or even less than or equal to a total of 10 degrees of angular deviation, that is, the sum of 5 degrees of deviation to the medial side 35 and also to the lateral side 36 can suffice to well serve the stability needs or requirements of wearer's who may have a tendency to over-pronate or over-supinate. Moreover, angular rotation of the inferior spring element 50 can change the length of the effective lever arm and thereby change the effective stiffness and cushioning characteristics provided thereby. Accordingly, both the cushioning and stability characteristics of an inferior spring element 50 can possibly be optimized by an individual wearer selecting a desired angular orientation relative to the longitudinal axis 69.
 FIG. 532 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 for possible use with an article of footwear having a longitudinal flex notch 71.1 and two flex notches 71.2 and 71.3 on the lateral side 36, and also a wear prevention insert 130 positioned in an opening 72. As shown, notches 71.3 and 71.6 are aligned to approximately correspond to the position of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joint indicated by line 104, thereby creating a line of flexion 54. The length of all the flex notches 71 can be varied to change the local stiffness characteristics and overall performance of the superior spring element 47.
 FIG. 533 is a lateral side view of the superior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 532.
 FIG. 534 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 for possible use with an article of footwear having a longitudinal flex notch 71.1 and three flex notches 71.2, 71.3, and 71.4 on the lateral side 36 which can serve to create a forefoot strike zone 176, that is, an area of reduced local stiffness for attenuating impact events on the lateral side 36 relative to the medial side 35.
 FIG. 535 is a lateral side view of the superior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 534.
 FIG. 536 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 for possible use with an article of footwear having a longitudinal flex notch 71.1 and two flex notches 71.2 and 71.3 on the lateral side 36 that straddle the approximate position corresponding to the metatarsal-phalangeal joints 104 of a wearer's foot. This configuration can facilitate the positioning of a cushioning medium or cushioning means in continuity under the ball of a wearer's forefoot.
 FIG. 537 is a lateral side view of the superior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 536.
 FIG. 538 is a top plan view of a superior spring element for possible use with an article of footwear having two flex notches 71.2 and 71.3 on the lateral side 36. The presence of a longitudinal flex notch generally serves to decrease the stiffness of the superior spring element 47 near the anterior side 33, and accordingly, all things being equal, this embodiment would be stiffer relative to that shown in FIG. 532.
 FIG. 539 is a lateral side view of the superior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 538.
 FIG. 540 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including a superior spring element 47 shown in phantom dashed lines and an inferior spring element 50. The configuration of this article of footwear 22 is generally similar to that shown in FIG. 524, but for the exclusion of the external heel counter 24. Accordingly, the posterior portion of the superior spring element 50 can also contribute to deflection when loaded, that is, depending upon its thickness and stiffness, as desired.
 FIG. 541 is a medial side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 540.
 FIG. 542 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including a superior spring element 47 including an integral heel counter 24 shown in phantom dashed lines and an inferior spring element 50. This configuration can slightly decrease the overall heel elevation relative to that shown in FIG. 524. Also shown for illustrative purposes is the possible use of an inferior spring element 50 having uniform thickness, as opposed to a tapered configuration.
 FIG. 543 is a medial side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 542.
 FIG. 544 is a rear view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIGS. 542 and 543, and showing the posterior side 34 of the inferior spring element 50 having uniform thickness.
 FIG. 545 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 having an integral heel counter 24 for possible use in an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 542, 543, and 544. Accordingly, the superior spring element 47 is configured so as to be positioned inside of the upper 23. Alternately, the midfoot area 67 and forefoot area 58 of the superior spring element 47 could include other flex notch patterns such as those shown in FIGS. 532, 534, and 536.
 FIG. 546 is a lateral side view of the superior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 545.
 FIG. 547 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including a superior spring element 47 including an integral external heel counter 24 and an inferior spring element 50. In this embodiment, the superior spring element 47 is substantially positioned between the upper 23 and the anterior outsole element 44.
 FIG. 548 is a medial side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 547.
 FIG. 549 is a top plan view of a superior spring element 47 including an integral external heel counter 24 for possible use with an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 547 and 548. Alternately, the midfoot area 67 and forefoot area 58 of the superior spring element 47 could include flex notch patterns such as those shown in FIGS. 532, 534, 536, and 545.
 FIG. 550 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including an inferior spring element 50 having asymmetrical curvature on the medial side 35 and lateral side 36. For reference purposes, the reader may wish to refer to the terminology used in FIG. 530 in order to better understand the following discussion. In the inferior spring element 47 shown in FIG. 550, the radius of curvature between the anterior tangent point and posterior tangent point associated with the anterior curve is different on the medial side 35 relative to the lateral side 36. As shown in FIG. 550, the radius of curvature with respect to the anterior curve is smaller on the medial side 35 than on the lateral side 36.
 FIG. 551 is a medial side view of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 550.
 FIG. 552 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 having parts broken away showing the anterior outsole element 44 affixed directly to the upper 23. In this regard, the anterior outsole element 44 can be affixed by conventional adhesives or with the use of a self-adhesive surface. Alternately, the anterior outsole element 44 can be direct injection molded to the upper 23. In some footwear applications, the anterior outsole element 44 can be made of a recyclable and/or biodegradable plastics material.
 FIG. 553 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 having parts broken away showing portions of an anterior outsole element 44 passing through openings 72 in the inferior side 38 of the upper 23. The traction members 115 can be injection molded, co-injection molded, or otherwise affixed in functional relation to a relatively thin backing 30 portion that serves to bridge and properly register the traction members 115 relative to the openings 72, and also more generally within the upper 23. Further, the traction members 115 can also include an undercut 154 portion which can enable the traction members 115 to be press fit or snap fit into place in relation to the upper 23. Further, a gasket 142 generally similar to that shown and discussed in association with FIG. 437 can be used between the anterior outsole element 44 and the upper 23 to help seal and affix their mating surfaces. As shown, the inferior side of the bridge 177 portions of the upper 23 can be reinforced and protected by a wear resistant material such as a plastic material 138. As shown, the insole 31 can include a raised profile in the rearfoot area 68 for providing additional padding and protection from the external heel counter 24. Also shown is the use of two wear prevention inserts 130, one being inserted into the inferior side of the external heel counter 24, and the other into the superior side of the inferior spring element 50. The two wear prevention inserts 130 can include mating portions for preventing rotation when secured by a fastener 29 as shown in FIGS. 530 and 531. If desired, the head of the fastener 29 can be countersunk so as to fit flush with a superior spring element 47 or inferior spring element 50. The posterior outsole element 46 can include a backing 30 and a pocket 131 into which the posterior end of the inferior spring element 50 can be inserted, and the inferior spring element 50 including the posterior outsole element 46 and backing 30 can then be secured with the use of a fastener 29. Accordingly, the upper 23, insole 31, superior spring element 47, wear prevention inserts 130, superior spring element 47, external heel counter 24, anterior outsole element 44, inferior spring element 50, posterior outsole element 46, and fastener 29 are all removable, replaceable and customizable, and substantially affixed by mechanical means possibly including the use of a single fastener 29.
 FIG. 554 is a bottom plan view of an upper 23 having a plurality of openings 72 for permitting portions of an anterior outsole element 44 to pass therethrough. Also shown are bridge 177 portions of the upper 23, and the use of a plastic material 138 on the inferior side 38 of the upper. The embodiment of an upper 23 shown in FIG. 554 is generally similar to that shown in FIG. 351, but features a more robust construction near the anterior side 33 including a traction member 115 that is affixed directly to the inferior side 38 and also a portion of the anterior side 33 of the upper 23.
 FIG. 555 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 553, but further including an anterior outsole element 44 having a backing 30 portion including an integral stability element 136. The stability element 136 is positioned inside the upper 23 and can include a plurality of upwardly directed portions such as 136.1, 136.2, and 136.3 for enhancing stability and fit, but also notches therebetween for enhancing its flexibility characteristics. As shown, the insole 31 can include a raised profile substantially about the circumference of a wearer's foot for providing protection and enhancing comfort.
 FIG. 556 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an insole 31 including an elevated heel pad 178 for possible use with an article of footwear 22. By changing the thickness of the heel pad 178 of the insole 31, the effective length size of an article of footwear 22 into which the insole is inserted can be changed, as desired. In this regard, it is possible to change the effective length size of a given upper 23 by at least one full size range, e.g., a given select upper can be made to fit size 9, 9.5, and 10. This feature can be advantageous since wearer's often have one foot that is one half size larger than the other. Further, a given select upper can then be used to span a greater size range, and this makes for greater economy in manufacturing, but also in supply and inventory.
 FIG. 557 is a longitudinal cross-sectional side view of an insole 31 including an elevated heel pad 178, an elevated toe pad 179, but also an elevated side pad 180 for encompassing a wearer's foot. By changing the thickness of the heel pad 178 and/or the toe pad 179 of the insole 31, the effective length size of an article of footwear 22 into which the insole 31 is inserted can be changed, as desired. In this regard, it is possible to change the effective length size of a given upper 23 by at least one full size range, e.g., a given select upper can be made to fit size 9, 9.5, and 10. This feature can be advantageous since wearer's often have one foot that is one half size larger than the other. Further, a given select upper can then be used to span a greater size range, and this makes for greater economy in manufacturing, but also in supply and inventory. Moreover, by changing the thickness of the inferior side 38 and/or the elevated side pad 180 portion of the insole, the effective width and girth of the article of footwear 22 into which the insole 31 is inserted can be changed, as desired. Accordingly, it can be possible to change the effective width of an article of footwear 22 in the range between AA-EE.
 FIG. 558 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 having parts broken away showing the possible use of an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 further including an external stability element 136. As shown, a plurality of relatively small fasteners 29 including a male mating structure 128 can pass through openings such as flex notches 71 present in the superior spring element 47 and the inferior side of the upper 23, and then be mechanically engaged and affixed in functional relation by those complimentary female mating structures 129 included in the anterior outsole element 44. Optionally, the superior side of the anterior outsole element can also include a tactified surface or a self-adhesive surface protected by a removable peel-ply layer for further affixing the anterior outsole element to an upper.
 FIG. 559 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 having parts broken away showing the possible use of an anterior outsole element 44 including a backing 30 further including an external stability element 136 that includes upwardly extending straps 118 for use with closure means 120 such as laces 121, straps, and the like. The inclusion of upwardly extending straps 118 for use with closure means 120 can serve to further secure the anterior outsole element 44 in functional relation with the upper 23, and in particular, with respect to an article of footwear that is intended for use in activities requiring substantial lateral movement. The backing 30 portion of the anterior outsole element 44 further includes a plurality of male mating structures 128 such as protuberances 99 and/or hooks 27 for mating with complimentary female mating structures 129 which are present in the upper 23 and/or superior spring element 47. Again, the superior side of the anterior outsole element can also include a tactified surface or a self-adhesive surface protected by a removable peel-ply layer for further affixing the anterior outsole element to an upper.
 FIG. 560 is a top plan view of a male part 85 of a fastener 29 for possible use with the female part 86 of a fastener 29 shown in FIGS. 562 and 563, whereby the male part 85 and female part 86 of the fastener 29 can be secured together to a desired torque value. As shown in FIG. 560, the male part 85 of a fastener 29 includes both an Allen drive receptacle 168 and flat blade drive receptacle 169. Accordingly an Allen wrench tool, or alternately a screwdriver or other blade like implement can be used to manipulate the male part 85 of the fastener 29. Moreover, a common piece of spare change such as a quarter can alternately be used for the same purpose. When a single male part 85 of a metal fastener 29 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 560 is being used to affix the components of an article of footwear together, the approximate B dimension as indicated in FIG. 560 will generally be in the range between 8-25 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 10-20 mm.
 FIG. 561 shows a side view of the male part 85 of a fastener 29 shown in FIG. 560. When a single male part 86 of a metal fastener 29 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 560 and 561 is being used to affix the components of an article of footwear together, the approximate C dimension as indicated in FIG. 561 will generally be in the range between 1.0-2.0 mm. The required size of the threaded portion of the male part 85 is generally in the range between Â¼th and Â½ inch, thus 5/16ths of an inch can generally be used. The bolt or male part 85 can include a thin plastic coating 138 for preventing it from becoming accidentally loosened. Further, the inferior side of the head or flange portion of the bolt or male part 85 can include a textured surface such as a plurality of serrations for enhancing its holding power relative to a portion of a spring element 51.
 FIG. 562 shows a side view of a female part 86 of a fastener 29 for possible use with the male part 85 of a fastener 29 shown in FIGS. 560 and 561. When a single female part 86 of a metal fastener 29 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 562 is being used to affix the components of an article of footwear together, the approximate A dimension indicated in FIG. 562 will vary in accordance with the width of the superior spring element, upper, and inferior spring element, but will generally be in the range between 5-20 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 8-12 mm. Moreover, the approximate D dimension as indicated in FIG. 562 will generally be in the range of 5-15 mm, and in particular, commonly in the range between 8-12 mm. The required size of the threaded opening is normally in the range between Â¼th and Â½ inch, thus 5/16ths of an inch can generally be used. Further, the superior side of the head or flange portion of the female part 86 can include a textured surface such as a plurality of serrations for enhancing its holding power relative to a portion of a spring element 51.
 FIG. 563 is a bottom plan view of the female part 86 of a fastener 29 shown in FIG. 562, further including the symbol of a registered trademark indicia. Accordingly, the bottom side of an exposed fastener 29 on the inferior side 38 of an article of footwear 22 can simply appear to be a trademark indicia.
 FIG. 564 is a side view engineering drawing showing the dimensions of an inferior spring element 50 for possible use with a men's size 9 article of footwear. For example, the article of footwear could be generally similar to those shown in FIG. 524, 525, 568, 569, or 575, or those shown elsewhere within the present application, and the like. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 has an overall length of 5.25 inches, and the anterior portion 157 can measure 1.125 inches, the middle portion 158 can measure 2.5 inches, and the posterior portion 159 can measure 1.625 inches. Alternately, the overall length can be reduced by 0.25 inch by subtracting 0.125 inches from both the anterior portion 157 and the posterior portion 159. As shown, the anterior portion 157 also projects downwards at a three degree angle towards the anterior side 33. This can facilitate attaining an advantageous geometry and fit with respect to a superior spring element and also an external heel counter. Further, the inferior spring element 50 can have a maximum width in the range between 75-80 mm, and the flexural axis can be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees. Given the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 564 for a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous maximum width is approximately 77 mm, and the addition of a posterior outsole element 46 including a backing 30 that overlaps the edges of the inferior spring element 50 by 1.5 mm on both the medial side 35 and lateral side 36 can therefore bring the maximum width of the outsole net to approximately 80 mm.
As shown in FIG. 564, the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 of the anterior curve 162 has a radius of 2.606 inches, whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side 37 of the posterior curve 166 is 9.0 inches, and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side 38 of the posterior portion 159 is 5.138 inches. As shown, the vertical elevation is 0.6299 inches or 16 mm, and the thickness of the particular inferior spring element 50 shown is 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side 33 and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side 34. If and when desired, the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10-18 mm, something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 associated with the anterior curve 162 to also change, but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight, running technique, or characteristic running speeds, and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element 50 having the dimensions shown in FIG. 564, the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply: a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-120 pounds; 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120-140 pounds; 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140-160 pounds; 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160-180 pounds; 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180-200 pounds; and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200-220 pounds.
Generally, regarding a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches, the width in the range between 75-85 mm, the vertical elevation is in the range between 10-18 mm, and the thickness is in the range between 4-5.5 mm at the anterior side 33 and in the range between approximately 2-3 mm at the posterior side 34. Generally, an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature 163 for use in a men's size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve 162 is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches, an advantageous radius of curvature 181 with respect to the superior side 37 of the posterior curve 166 is in the range between 7 and 11 inches, and an advantageous radius of curvature 182 regarding the inferior side 38 of the posterior portion 159 is in the range between 4-6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running, given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown, it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees.
 FIG. 565 is a bottom plan view of an article of footwear 22 having a semi-curved lasted configuration including an inferior spring element 50 and a posterior outsole element 46 including a transparent backing 30 portion. As a result, a substantial portion of the inferior spring element 50 can be seen. Further, when a relatively transparent thermoplastic or polyurethane material is used to make the outsole 43 portion of the posterior outsole element 46 as well, substantially the entire inferior spring element 50 can be visible. As shown, the outsole 43 covers only about half of the bottom surface area associated with the inferior spring element 50, and this can provide adequate support and stability for some wearers.
 FIG. 566 is a bottom plan view of an article of footwear 22 having a semi-curved lasted configuration including a posterior outsole element 46 that substantially covers the bottom side of the inferior spring element 50. This configuration can provide greater support and stability in the rearfoot area 68 and midfoot area 67 for wearers having a tendency to excessively supinate or pronate. Further, this configuration can also be advantageous for use with articles of footwear intended for use in activities requiring substantial lateral movement.
 FIG. 567 is a bottom plan view of an article of footwear 22 having a straight lasted configuration relative to those shown in FIGS. 565 and 566, and also a wider inferior spring element 50 and posterior outsole element 46 in the midfoot area 67. This configuration can provide greater support and stability in the rearfoot area 68 and midfoot area 67 for wearers having a tendency to excessively supinate or pronate, and in particular, those individuals having relatively flat arches. Further, this configuration can also be advantageous for use with articles of footwear intended for use in activities requiring substantial lateral movement.
 FIG. 568 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 524, further including a fluid-filled bladder 101. Again, the fluid-filled bladder 101 can include a gas that is at ambient atmospheric pressure, or alternately the gas can be pressured above atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the fluid-filled bladder 101 can occupy a portion, or alternately can occupy substantially all of the space between the external heel counter 24 and the inferior spring element 50.
 FIG. 569 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 generally similar to that shown in FIG. 525, but including a posterior outsole element 46 generally similar to that shown in FIGS. 566 and 567. As shown in FIG. 569, the posterior outsole element 46 can include an integral stabilizer 63 for enhancing both cushioning and stability in the midfoot area 67.
 FIG. 570 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including an upper 23 that is substantially made using three dimensional and/or circular knitting methods, or the like. These methods and techniques are commonly used in the making of apparel such as socks. Various socks and methods of making socks and like apparel items are taught in published patents including, but not limited to: U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,741,340, 1,889,716, 2,102,368, 2,144,563, 2,333,373, 2,391,064, 2,687,528, 2,771,691, 2,790,975, 3,085,410, 3,102,271, 3,274,709, 3,796,067, 4,253,317, 4,263,793, 4,341,096, 4,520,635, 4,615,188, 4,651,354, 4,732,015, 4,898,007, 5,230,333, 5,771,495, 5,784,721, 5,829,057, 5,946,731, 6,021,527, 6,122,937, 6,154,983, 6,138,281, 6,139,929, 6,230,525, 6,247,182, 6,256,824, 6,286,151, 6,292,951, 6,306,483, 6,314,584, 6,324,874, 6,334,222, 6,336,227, 6,354,114, 6,393,620, 6,446,267, 6,451,144, 6,457,332, EP 0 593 394 A1, D401,758, D403,149, D461,045, and also patents granted to James L.

Several of the aforementioned patents also relate to making an upper for an article of footwear, and in particular, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,595,005, 5,724,753, 5,881,413, 5,909,719, 6,154,983, 6,256,824, 6,308,438, and D374,553. All of the patents and patent applications recited in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference herein.
As shown in FIG. 570, various portions of the upper 23 can thereby be made of different textile materials and knits. For example, the vamp 52 can be made of a four way elastic textile material 137.1 and the quarter 119 can be made of a two way elastic textile material 137.2, whereas the tip 25 and other select portions of the upper 23 can be made with a relatively inelastic textile material 137.3. The primary desired direction of stretch of the elastic textile materials 137.1 and 137.2 has been indicated with arrows. As shown, the upper 23 includes conventional lace 121 closure means 120.
 FIG. 571 is a medial side view of an article of footwear 22 including an upper 23 that is substantially made using three dimensional and/or circular knitting methods, or the like, generally similar to that shown in FIG. 570, further including a plastic material 138. The textile material portion of the upper 23 can be placed in functional relation upon a footwear last, or like mold, and the plastic material 138 can then be injection molded, bonded, fused, or applied with heat and pressure to the textile material.
 FIG. 572 is a lateral side view of a portion of an upper 23 that is made using three dimensional and/or circular knitting techniques, or the like. The upper 23 can include a plurality of different textile materials and knits having different aesthetic, mechanical and physical properties. For example, a comfortable knit textile material 137.4 having resilient elastic characteristics can be used about the collar 122 in order to help prevent the entry of foreign matter into the upper 23, a three dimensional textile material 137.6 can be used to form a dorsal pad 172 in order to protect the wearer's foot from binding pressure possibly exerted by closure means, a four way stretch elastic textile material 137.1 can be used in the vamp 52 in order to accommodate flexion of a wearer's toes, a two way or four way stretch elastic textile material 137.2 having greater stiffness and resistance to elongation can be used in the quarter 119, and a textile material 137.3 that provides relatively little elongation and has excellent wear properties can be used in the tip 25 and anterior side 33, and also about the lower portion of the medial side 33, lateral side 36, posterior side 34, and inferior side 38 of the upper 23. Also shown is the plantar portion 173, and heel portion 174 of the upper 23.
 FIG. 573 is a lateral side view of a portion of an alternate upper 23 generally similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 572, but instead showing the use of a two way or four way stretch textile material 137.2 about a portion of the medial side 35, lateral side 36 and inferior side 38 of the upper 23, and also showing parts broken away. The use of a two way or four way stretch textile material 137.2 between the quarters 119 on the medial side 35 and lateral side 36 passing under the inferior side 38 of the upper 23 and a wearer's foot can introduce a functional elongation capability with respect to the length size of the upper 23. For example, an upper 23 having a given length size corresponding to men's size 9 could thereby be functional for use with sizes 8.5, 9, and 9.5, and perhaps even sizes 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, and 10. The makes for greater economy in manufacture and supply with respect to inventory. Again, the upper 23 can include a plurality of different textile materials and knits having different aesthetic, mechanical and physical properties. For example, a comfortable knit textile material 137.4 having resilient elastic characteristics can be used about the collar 122 in order to help prevent the entry of foreign matter into the upper 23, a three dimensional textile material 137.6 can be used to form a dorsal pad 172 in order to protect the wearer's foot from binding pressure possibly exerted by closure means, a four way stretch elastic textile material 137.1 can be used in the vamp 52 in order to accommodate flexion of a wearer's toes, a two way or four way stretch elastic textile material 137.2 having greater stiffness and resistance to elongation can be used in the quarter 119 and can also extend about the medial side 35, lateral side 36, and inferior side 38, and a textile material 137.3 that provides relatively little elongation and has excellent wear properties can be used in the tip 25 and anterior side 33, and also about a substantial portion of the lower portion of the medial side 35, lateral side 36, posterior side 34, and inferior side 38 of the upper 23. Also shown is the plantar portion 173, and heel portion 174 of the upper 23.
 FIG. 574 is a lateral side view of the portion of an upper 23 shown in FIG. 573, further including several straps 118.1, 118.2, and 118.3, and also an external stability element 136 consisting of an over-molded plastic material 138. A portion of strap 118.1 can be affixed or consist of a portion of the backtab 175. Strap 118.3 includes a d-ring 150 and also VELCROÂ® hook and pile 140 closure means 120.
 FIG. 575 is a lateral side view of an article of footwear 22 including the upper 23 shown in FIG. 574, but further including an external heel counter 24, an inferior spring element 50, a superior spring element 47 and an insole 31 positioned inside the upper 23 that are not visible in the side view, a posterior outsole element 46, a fastener 29, and an anterior outsole element 44. Since the upper 23 can be substantially made without the need for substantial hand stitching or other labor intensive techniques, it can be made economically in the United States, or otherwise near the intended market. Again, the capability of the upper 23 to possibly serve a range of length sizes further simplifies manufacturing, supply, and inventory. Further, as previously discussed, if desired, a substantial portion of an article of footwear 22, that is, greater than fifty percent, and preferably greater than seventy-five percent, and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper 23 to make a custom article of footwear 22 within minutes. Again, the upper 23 can be substantially made of recyclable and/or biodegradable materials, and substantially all the other various footwear components can also be made of materials that are recyclable. Accordingly, the materials, manufacturing methods, structure and way that various footwear components can be simply and rapidly assembled to make a custom article of footwear, and the method of conducting retail and Internet business taught in the present application can be associated with significant value added and economic efficiency, but also a substantially recyclable and environmentally friendly product.

As shown, posterior spacer 42 can be made of a foam material 134, and can partially or completely occupy the void space that could otherwise exists between the superior side of the inferior spring element 50 and inferior side of the upper 23, thus can prevent barbed wire or other objects from catching or becoming snagged therebetween. The semi-circular recessed area of the sole 32 adjacent the fastener 29 can be advantageous when using rope bridges and ladders. The article of footwear 22 includes an upper 23 which has been over-lasted, that is, the upper 23 enjoys a configuration and sufficient volume to have the ability to accommodate a wearer having a larger foot size, and in particular, the upper 23 has the ability to accommodate different footwear components such as insoles 31, liners, fit-sleeves, slippers, socks, or alternate articles of footwear therein. For example, the insole 31 can include elevated portions on the anterior, posterior, medial side and lateral side having a thickness of approximately 5 mm, and a thickness on the inferior side of approximately 10 mm, but other dimensions are possible. In an alternate embodiment, an insole 31 having substantial thickness can thereby afford some or all of the cushioning normally provided by the midsole 26 of an article of footwear 22, and as a result the midsole 26 positioned on the external side of the upper 23 can be reduced in thickness or even eliminated. The aforementioned structure and method of over-lasting and substituting footwear components can be used with many different kinds of shoes and boots including but not limited to athletic shoes and military boots.
 FIG. 615 is a cross-sectional lateral side view 36 of the article of footwear 22 shown in FIG. 612. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 can have a different configuration on the lateral side 36 relative to the medial side 35, and in particular, such can provide greater stiffness on the medial side 35 when loaded and compressed for enhancing biomechanical stability during movement.
 FIG. 616 is a bottom view of the article of footwear shown in FIG. 612. As shown, the sole 32 can include an outsole 43 having an anterior transverse groove 199 and a metatarsal-phalangeal joint transverse groove 200, and also a longitudinal groove 198 which can be associated with lines of flexion 54. Further, the longitudinal groove 198 and/or anterior transverse groove 199 can be used to mechanically mate with complementary mating structures on accessories such as bindings, fins, crampons, snow shoes, and skis.
 FIG. 617 is a bottom view of the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIGS. 614 and 615. As shown, the inferior spring element 50 includes a flexural axis 59 that is offset approximately 20 degrees from its transverse axis which coincides with the anterior tangent point or line 160, and also a posterior tangent point or line 161 as previously defined within this document.
 FIG. 618 is a bottom view of the posterior outsole element 46 shown in position on the inferior spring element 50 shown in FIG. 616.
 FIG. 619 is a medial side view of an aquatic boot 201 similar to that used by Navy SEAL Team members for use with the article of footwear shown in FIGS. 612-616. In particular, the conventional insole 31 can be removed and the aquatic boot 201 can then be used instead within the article of footwear 22. This can be advantageous, e.g., when soldiers will be landing on beaches or otherwise exposed to cold water conditions. Further, it can be readily understood that a wearer can use the aquatic boot 201, and then quickly don the article of footwear 22, and vice-versa, as desired. The aquatic boot 201 can include an upper made of a textile laminated neoprene 202, an elastic material 203 near the collar 122, and a rubber outsole 43.
 FIG. 620 is a medial side 35 view of a cold temperature slipper or liner 205 for use with the article of footwear shown in FIGS. 612-616. The slipper or liner 205 can be made of a textile covered Thinsulate material, or the like, and can also include closure means such as elastic 203, and an outsole 43.
 FIG. 621 is a medial side 35 view of a hot and wet climate slipper or liner 232 for use with the article of footwear shown in FIGS. 612-616. As shown, the hot and wet climate slipper or liner 232 can have a upper 23 made of a substantially waterproof material 211, a collar 112 including an elastic material 203, a ventilating insole 206, and also a ventilating tongue or snorkel 207. The ventilating insole 206 and ventilating tongue or snorkel 207 can permit heat and moisture to escape from the interior of the hot and wet climate slipper or liner 232. Further, the collar 122 is flippable as between an up and down position. In the up position, the ventilating tongue or snorkel 207 and interior of the hot and wet climate slipper or liner 232 is effectively sealed off by the collar 122 which includes elastic material 203. This can be advantageous when walking in deep water or muddy conditions as the wearer's feet can remain clean and relatively dry. In the down position, the ventilating tongue or snorkel 207 and interior of the hot and wet climate slipper or liner 232 is in communication with the exterior environment and prevent undue heat and moisture build-up therein.
 FIG. 622 is a lateral side 36 view of a rock climbing shoe 231 having an upper including a tongue 127, eyestays 139, collar 122, quarter 119, vamp 52, and an outsole 43 made of a durable rubber compound.

The hoop 229 of the crampon 228 can be mechanically engaged with the front tab groove 224, and the catch 230 can be mechanically engaged with the back tab hold 225 of the article of footwear 22.
The upper 23 of the article of footwear can be substantially made without the need for substantial hand stitching or other labor intensive techniques, and so it can be made economically in the United States, or otherwise near the intended market. Again, the capability of the upper 23 to possibly serve a range of length sizes further simplifies manufacturing, supply, and inventory. Further, as previously discussed, if desired, a substantial portion of an article of footwear 22, that is, greater than fifty percent, and preferably greater than seventy-five percent, and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper 23 to make a custom article of footwear 22 within minutes. Again, the upper 23 can be substantially made of recyclable and/or biodegradable materials, and substantially all the other various footwear components can also be made of materials that are recyclable.
Given the teachings and substantial disclosure of the present invention in this specification and the associated drawing figures, it can be readily understood that at least some of the following article of footwear component selection options can be provided to a wearer or customer, e.g., via an Internet website, a cell phone, a remote manufacturing or distribution site, a medical facility, or a retail establishment. Moreover, many other selection options are possible. Again, the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can be rapidly assembled and customized in response to an individual's selections. The following is one example of a component selection guide for the method of making a custom article of footwear according to the present invention.
