DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The MEDIA CONTENT BASED ADVERTISING SURVEY PLATFORM APPARATUSES AND SYSTEMS provides a client-server interactive platform whereby a user may operate a general purpose personal mobile device (e.g., a smart phone, etc.) to receive a list of TV programs schedules and submit a selection of TV channel via the personal mobile device. In one implementation, the user may operate the personal mobile device as a TV remote controller. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may receive the user's selection of a channel and determine what media contents the user has elected to watch. In one implementation, the user's channel selection and viewing status may be populated to a social media platform, and the AD-SURVEY may obtain user response with regard to a TV program from the social media to perform analytics for TV program feedback review.
For example, in one implementation, a user may plug a AD-SURVEY accessory (e.g., 120 in FIG. 1) into his mobile device, such as a smartphone (e.g., an Apple iPhone, BlackBerry, Google Android, Palm, HTC Evo, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer (e.g., Apple iTouch, iPad, etc.), and/or the like, to facilitate communication between the mobile device and a home TV set. In an alternative implementation, the AD-SURVEY accessory may be a standalone table top unit which may not need to be attached to a user mobile device. For example, the table top unit may communicate with a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a cell phone or mobile device and/or the like via wired or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). In further implementations, the table top unit may monitor audience activities as further illustrated in FIGS. 1C, 2E-2H. Further implementations of the table top unit are illustrated in FIG. 4C. Within implementations, a AD-SURVEY server may obtain real-time TV program listing, including the TV program schedule, advertisement schedule, and/or the like, from a TV network. The user may then obtain the list of TV program schedules from the AD-SURVEY, e.g., as shown at 115 in FIG. 1. The user may then submit a channel selection, e.g., tap on the touch screen of the mobile device as shown at 105 in FIG. 1. In one implementation, upon receiving the user channel selection, the AD-SURVEY server may retrieve data record from a media content database and check program table to determine what's the TV program on air. For example, if the user selects the channel âCBS,â the AD-SURVEY may ascertain âCBSâ has âThe Big Bang Theoryâ on air based on the timestamp when the user submits the selection. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may further retrieve a program table to obtain information with regard to the advertisement streamed during the intervals of the TV play âThe Big Bang Theoryâ and/or the product placement advertisements tagged in the TV play âThe Big Bang Theoryâ on âCBS.â
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may parse commercial ad information retrieved at and generate prompt questions, surveys, and/or the like 408. For example, if the AD-SURVEY determines the user is supposed to watch a series of âAudiâ commercial during the show âThe Big Bang Theory,â the AD-SURVEY may prompt a survey including questions with regard to automobile purchasing. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may keep a record of advertisements that has played on channels the user has recently selected (e.g., for a period of past 2 weeks, etc.), and generate prompt questions based on such advertisements. In one implementation, the user may submit responses to such questions.
In a further implementation, when a user is provided a question with regard to an embedded advertisement in the TV show (e.g., âare you interested in the red bag the character is carrying?â etc.), the user may submit a request to learn more and/or purchase the product. In that case, the AD-SURVEY may provide a merchant URL to the user and/or redirect the user to the merchant site.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may monitor whether the user is âactuallyâ attending and watching the selected TV channel. For example, the user's mobile device may capture, aggregate and packetize atmospherics data (e.g., taking photos of the user, recoding audio clips, obtaining GPS information, etc.) and submit to the AD-SURVEY, which may in turn decode the atmospherics data to analyze ad effect and audience perception, as further illustrated in FIGS. 2E-2G.
Ad-Survey
 FIG. 1A shows a block diagram flow chart illustrating work flows of AD-SURVEY within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, the AD-SURVEY platform 105 may facilitate clients, such as merchants, brand name manufacturers, media producers, and/or the like to plan 105 a advertisement campaign program, track advertisement targets to determine ad delivery 105 c (e.g., whether the ads are viewed by the audience, etc.) and performance 105 b (e.g., whether the advertisements meet a sales/brand image goal, etc.).
Within implementations, the AD-SURVEY platform 105 may interact with user mobile devices, e.g., PDAs, smart phones, etc., for targeted mobile advertisement delivery 104. For example, in one implementation, AD-SURVEY platform may obtain a TV viewing status information from a user's mobile device, and determine the TV program content the user is/has been watching based on TV schedules, as further discussed in FIG. 1B. When AD-SURVEY determines the user selected channel contains a TV ad of âGeicoâ 104 b, AD-SURVEY may deliver promotions, rewards, coupons, questionnaires, etc., related to âGeicoâ as a targeted ad 104 a to the user mobile device.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY platform 105 may obtain data related to user interactive activities with regard to mobile ads, TV viewing, Internet 102 (including online browsing, purchasing, etc.), social media, and/or the like to analyze ad effects, TV rating so that to determine delivery 105 c and performance 105 b of an advertisement campaign. Within implementations, the ad campaign planning 105 a, ad performance 105 b and ad delivery 105 c, may be separately executed by the AD-SURVEY platform 105 for each media type, e.g., TV, print, Internet, social media, etc.
 FIG. 1B shows a block diagram illustrating a user engaging a personal mobile device as a TV remote control within embodiments of AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, a user may download a AD-SURVEY client component for instantiation on his general purpose personal mobile device 115. For example, the user may obtain a AD-SURVEY application from the iTunes Store and download it to his AppleÂ® iPhone, iTouch, iPad, and/or the like. In one implementation, the user may plug-in a AD-SURVEY accessory 120 to the mobile device 115 so that the mobile device may communicate with a home TV set 130 as a remote controller.
In one implementation, upon instantiating the downloaded AD-SURVEY client component, the user may receive a schedule listing of TV programs, and may select a channel that the user is interested. For example, the user may tap on the listed item to select âCH2: CBS The Big Bang Theory 105.â In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY plug-in accessory 120 may receive the indication of user channel selection and transmit such indication to the home TV set 130, and the TV 130 may switch to the channel âCBS 110â accordingly.
In a further implementation, the user's selection of channel âCBS 105â may be transmitted to a AD-SURVEY, which may in turn automatically populate a message on social media, e.g., a Facebook status update showing the user âis watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS 135.â In an alternative implementation, the user may elect to manually enter and populate the social media feeds via the AD-SURVEY client component instantiated on his personal mobile device.
For another example, the social message, e.g., a Tweet message, may contextually tag the text on key terms to indicate what the user is watching, e.g., the Tweet hashtags â#The Big Bang Theory,â â#CBS,â etc. In one implementation, the hashtags may link to profile information of a TV show, including its scheduled airing time, crew information, description, and/or the like. In further implementations, the Tweet hashtags may be employed for social content data taxonomy engine, as further illustrated in FIGS. 6B-6E.
 FIG. 1B shows a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of audience attendance monitoring within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within implementations, AD-SURVEY may monitor the audience attendance of selected TV program. For example, upon a user selecting a TV channel at his personal mobile device 115 (e.g., by tapping on the channel listing as shown at 105 in FIG. 1A), the user may or may not be present watching the TV program broadcasting on the channel, e.g., the user may step away, may engage in other activities distracting him from the TV, may invite one or more other audience watching the selected TV channel, etc. In such scenarios, AD-SURVEY may constantly, periodically and/or intermittently âmonitorâ the audience status to obtain knowledge of the audience viewing data.
As shown in one example in FIG. 1B, the personal mobile device 115 may automatically snap a photo and/or a video clip of the audience scene including the audience 118 watching the TV program 110. For example, the AD-SURVEY may be configured to snap a photo or video clip periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes, etc.). The AD-SURVEY may then packetize the obtained photo/video clip as audience atmospherics data 125 for audience attendance analysis.
In further implementations, AD-SURVEY may include various data into the atmospherics data packets. For example, AD-SURVEY may âlistenâ and record an audio clip of the audience scene. For another example, AD-SURVEY may prompt the user to indicate how many audience are present to watch the on-going TV program. For another example, AD-SURVEY may monitor whether the user is engaging in other application activities on the personal mobile device 115, e.g., email(s), Facebook, browser activities, gaming applications, etc. For another example, AD-SURVEY may include GPS information of the personal mobile device 115 into the atmospherics data.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may be configured to automatically create photo/video/audio captures. In another implementation, AD-SURVEY may prompt the user to manually enter desired information, such as how many individuals are present to watch the TV program, and/or request the user position the built-in camera of the mobile device to snap photos/video clips. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may provide promotion incentives for the user to cooperate with such requests, e.g., lottery opportunities, etc.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may analyze the obtained audience atmospherics data 125. For example, as shown in FIG. 1B, AD-SURVEY may identify the number of audience 138 at an associated timestamp from an audience scene photo/video 135 via face recognition software, e.g., Apple iPhoto face recognition, etc.
 FIG. 1C shows an example of intelligent mobile questionnaire within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may send synchronized questionnaire to a user's personal mobile device 115 based on the media program on-air at the user's selected TV channel. For example, if the user's selected TV channel 130 includes an advertisement 145 of Audi automobiles, AD-SURVEY may generate a question 123 to inquire the user's desired automobile brand. Such inquiry results may be collected by AD-SURVEY and fed to the advertising brand merchant 150 (e.g., Audi, etc.) to determine performance of the advertisement 145. For example, if the user selects âAudiâ when inquired about his desired automobile brand after watching the Audi advertisement channel, it may show effectiveness of the advertisement 155 over the TV channel. In further implementations, AD-SURVEY may include product placement advertisements, and/or the like in the pop-up questionnaire 123, as further discussed in FIGS. 2 and 7B.
 FIG. 1D shows an example of media analytics within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, a AD-SURVEY client may desire to know public opinions of their products, e.g., brand name products, TV programs, and/or the like. For example, as shown in FIG. 1D, the producer âCBS,â e.g., merchant 150, may want to know audience's reaction about the production âThe Big Bang Theoryâ 180. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may collect data from social media platforms, such as, but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, and/or the like, user comments and activities with regard to the show âThe Big Bang Theory.â For example, AD-SURVEY may obtain Tweets about users' comments on âThe Big Bang Theoryâ 185. For another example, AD-SURVEY may obtain Facebook user comments, activities (e.g., user âlikeâ of the âThe Big Bang Theoryâ page, news feed, etc.) from Facebook. Further implementations of obtaining data from social media platforms are discussed in FIGS. 5A-5F.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may generate a media analytics report 190 based on the obtained social media user comments to reflect audience reaction to the show âThe Big Bang Theory.â For example, in one implementation, the report may comprise statistical data with regard to audience age, demographics, occupation, etc. Further examples of media analytics report are discussed in FIG. 8C.
 FIG. 2A shows a block diagram illustrating data flows between NR-Control server and affiliated entities within various embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within various embodiments, one or more users 233 a, AD-SURVEY server 220, social media 250, TV network 270, AD-SURVEY database(s) 219, merchant 280, and/or social media 250 are shown to interact via various communication network 213.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY may receive a list of real time TV program 237 a. For example, in one implementation, the TV program 237 data may comprise information such as channel information, media program information of each channel, program schedule information, and/or the like. For example, the TV network 270 may provide a (Secure) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (âHTTP(S)â) PUT message including the TV schedule data 237 a in the form of data formatted according to the eXtensible Markup Language (âXMLâ). Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including an XML-formatted TV schedule for the AD-SURVEY server:

In one embodiment, the user 233 a may operate a client mobile device, which may receive a list of real time TV programs 237 b. In one embodiment, upon reviewing the received channel schedule 237 b, the user may submit a channel selection by tapping on a selected channel (e.g., see 105 in FIG. 1B). In one implementation, the user mobile device may be enabled with an infrared remote control component (e.g., a plug-in accessory 120 in FIG. 1B), and may send the channel submission indication 235 a to a client TV 233 b (e.g., a home TV set) via an infrared communication channel, which may result in a channel switch on TV. In another embodiment, when the user selects the channel from his mobile device (e.g., an Apple iPhone, etc.), the channel selection message 235 b may be transmitted to the AD-SURVEY server 220 in real time.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may provide the TV program schedule data to a TV set-top box (STB) 201, e.g., via a cable network, wherein the STB may receive user TV event messages 235 a and forward such information 235 c to the AD-SURVEY server 220. In another implementation, the STB 201 may directly communicate with a AD-SURVEY infrared component (e.g., 120 in FIG. 1B), a table unit, and/or the like. In one implementation, the TV event 235 a/b/c may comprise a variety of TV events, such as, but not limited to TV on/off, STB on/off, channel switch, and/or the like. In further implementations, when the user has registered non-live media facility (e.g., DVR, DVD, TiVo, etc.) with the AD-SURVEY, the TV event 235 a/b/c may comprise DVD player on/off, TiVo on/off, TiVo channel change, and/or the like. In one implementation, to operate and exchange data with the STB, the presentation layer on the user mobile device may adopt development tools, such as but not limited to Android, iOS app development tools, and/or the like. In one implementation, the TV set-up top box may similarly employ a presentation layer development tool compatible with that of the user mobile device, and may additionally employ HTML5 and web 2.0 presentation layers.
In one implementation, a TV channel selection event 235 b may be logged by the AD-SURVEY server 220 and stored as a real time data record in a AD-SURVEY database 219. For example, in one implementation, the user device may provide a HTTPS POST message including the TV channel selection message 235 b in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) POST message including an XML-formatted user trigger for the AD-SURVEY server:

In one embodiment, upon submitting a channel selection, the user 233 a may populate social media feeds of his viewing status 275 a to the social media network 250, wherein the user's friends may view his status, knowing what the user is watching, electing to âlike,â âdislike,â and/or comment on his status, and/or the like. For example, in one implementation, a AD-SURVEY client app may comprise a social feature (e.g., see 715 in FIG. 7A) so that a user may input a social media message (e.g., 715 b/c in FIG. 7A). In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may automatically generate a social message based on a pre-populated message format (e.g., a Tweet format with hashtags, etc.) send a message indicating the user's viewing status 275 b to the social media 250, which may automatically populate a social media status update. In such cases, the social media platform 250 may request user authorization for AD-SURVEY server 220 to access, e.g., download social data or send social data to social media, etc. The AD-SURVEY may obtain a user token for authorization to access the user's social media profile, content, and/or the like. The user authorization may be further discussed in FIGS. 5A-5C.
For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide a HTTPS POST message including a social message 275 b in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) POST message including an XML-formatted user viewing status 275 a/b for the AD-SURVEY server:

In the above example, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may automatically populate a social message to the user's Facebook page, showing a status update âJohn Doe is watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS.â
In a further implementation, the user 233 a may receive friends' recommendations 277 of TV programs from the social media 250 (e.g., see 705 in FIG. 7A). For example, the user may view a scroll-down list of friends' recommendations from a user interface via the user's mobile device.
In further embodiments, AD-SURVEY may load data 278 from the social media platform 250, e.g., user profile information, user comments/activity data related to an advertisement/a TV program, and/or the like. Further implementations and example data structures of the social media data 278 are discussed in FIG. 5F.
 FIG. 2B shows a block diagram illustrating data flows between AD-SURVEY entities within alternative embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within implementations, user mobile device 233 a may perform âambient listeningâ on the user. For example, when a user has submitted a channel selection, it is not guaranteed whether the user is indeed watching the TV program selected, e.g., the user may walk away, engaging in other activities such as playing video games, chatting with others, etc. As such, the user's mobile device 233 a may âlisten-inâ the user's behavior, e.g., by capturing live video of the surroundings of the user, by recording audio clips, by capturing a picture, and/or the like, to capture information as to whether and/or what the user is watching the TV. In one implementation, such âlisten-inâ data (e.g., video clips, audio clips, pictures, device application status, GPS coordinates, etc.) may be aggregated and packetized as atmospherics data 239 and transmitted to the AD-SURVEY server 220, which may analyze such atmospherics data to determine whether the user is watching, and integrate the atmospherics analytics in an audience statistics report 245. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide the audience statistics report 245 to the TV network 270 for TV program audience feedbacks.
For another example, in one implementation, the user device 233 a may generate an atmospherics data package as a HTTPS POST message in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) POST message including an XML-formatted atmospherics data 239 to provide to the AD-SURVEY server 220:

The user device may perform âambient listeningâ and generate atmospherics data package constantly, intermittently, and/or periodically (e.g., every hour, etc.) to âlisten-inâ user's watching status, e.g., whether the user is paying attention to the selected TV program. In the above example, the generated atmospherics data package may comprise a variety of data segments, such as a âMyRecord.mp3â audio clip which may indicate whether the played audio matches a selected channel program, whether the user is chatting with friends (e.g., see 298 at FIG. 2D); a âMyPic.JPEGâ photo taken by an iPhone camera, which may indicate whether the user is present with the TV set, and/or one or more individuals are present (e.g., see 297 at FIG. 2D); GPS information of the user mobile device which may indicate whether the user is present at his residential address where the home TV is located (e.g., see 299 c at FIG. 2D); user mobile device application status information including an actively running gaming application (e.g., âAngry Birdâ), which may indicate the user is playing the video game instead of paying attention to the TV program (e.g., see 299 a at FIG. 2D). In one implementation, the atmospherics data 239 a and/or analytics may be incorporated into a data record 290 a and stored in the database 219.
In another implementation, the user mobile device may send a device application event 241 indicating user device application status to the AD-SURVEY server 220. For example, the device application event 241 may comprise an actively engaged application information on the device, e.g., application ID, application name, application category, push email heart beat pulse, etc, which may suggest audience activities while watching TV, e.g., video gaming, texting, calling, checking email, browsing, playing music, editing photos, and/or the like. For example, in one implementation, the user device 233 a may generate a mobile application event as a HTTPS POST message in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) POST message including an XML-formatted device application status 241 to provide to the AD-SURVEY server 220:

In one implementation, the device application status 241 may comprise a list of application names that have been open and active for a minimum amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds, etc.). In another implementation, the device application status 241 may be periodically harvested to the AD-SURVEY serer.
 FIG. 2C provides a logic diagram illustrating user-server interactions within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, a user may instantiate a AD-SURVEY application component on a mobile device 250. The user may also plug a AD-SURVEY accessory (e.g., 120 in FIG. 1) into his mobile device to facilitate communication between the mobile device and a home TV set.
In one implementation, the user may submit a session request 253 to the AD-SURVEY server 220 via the mobile application, e.g., as shown in Table 1, the session request 253 may comprise a user ID and an event/session ID to indicate the AD-SURVEY application has stared. Upon receiving a user request, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may determine whether the user has registered with AD-SURVEY 255. For example, in one implementation, the user may be a new user to the AD-SURVEY application service, who may just download and install the mobile application but has not registered. If the user is not registered 258, the user may be requested to submit registration information, such as user name, phone number, email address, residential address, and/or the like for registration 260. The AD-SURVEY may also obtain a physical address, a hardware ID of the user mobile device, etc., for registration purposes.
In one implementation, upon registration, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may obtain and store a user application ID, and/or a session ID 265 to start the AD-SURVEY service session. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may obtain a real-time TV program listing 267, e.g., from a TV network, a TV broadcasting service, etc. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may obtain the TV schedule updates on a periodical basis (e.g., daily, etc.), and store the TV schedule information at a TV schedule database. In one implementation, the user 233 a may receive a list of TV programs 270 via the AD-SURVEY application, e.g., see 710 in FIG. 7A.
In one implementation, the user mobile device may send a user event message 280 to the AD-SURVEY server 220, and the AD-SURVEY server may monitor user event messages 276 from the user device. As discussed in FIGS. 2A-2B and will be further discussed in FIGS. 3A and 5A, the received user event at 276 may comprise a variety of events/messages, such as, but not limited to user TV event (e.g., 235 b in FIG. 2A), user device application event (e.g., 241 in FIG. 2B), atmospherics data (e.g., 239 in FIG. 2B), social content (e.g., 525 a/b in FIG. 5A), response to ads/surveys (e.g., 339 in FIG. 3A), and/or the like. In one implementation, upon receiving the message, the AD-SURVEY may determine a type of the message 288. In one implementation, the user event message may comprise user channel submission event 289 b, check-in/out messages, and/or the like, e.g., see 235 a in FIG. 2A. For another example, the user event message may comprise atmospherics data 289 a (as further illustrated in FIG. 2E), ad/survey response 289 c (as further illustrated in FIGS. 3B-3C), social data 289 d (as further illustrated in FIG. 5B), non-live TV consumption message 289 e (as illustrated in FIG. 2G. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine the message types 289 a-e based on the data structure, e.g., a field value of a field âmessage typeâ as shown in Table 2, message type code in the header information of a received data packet, and/or the like.
 FIG. 2D provides a logic flow diagram illustrating TV channel submission (e.g., 289 b/e) message (for live TV, and/or non-live TV program such as DVD playing, TiVo, media on demand, and/or the like) processing within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, upon receiving a channel TV event message at 289 b/e, the AD-SURVEY server may parse the received data message 2001 and save it in a raw data message database, e.g., as XML-formatted records in 219 a. For example, a variety of exemplary XML-formatted TV event message data structures (e.g., TV on/off, STB on/off, DVD on/off, channel change, etc.) are discussed at 235 a in FIG. 2A.
Within implementations, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether each received TV event message indicates a stable TV channel program selection, or a channel surfing. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY retrieve a list of unprocessed TV message records (e.g., grouped per user profile) 2002 from the raw data store 219 a. For every two consecutively received messages 2005, the AD-SURVEY may calculate the elapsed time in-between 2008, and determine whether the elapse time is greater than a pre-determined surfing threshold (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.). For example, when the elapsed time is shorter than the surfing threshold, indicating the user may be frequently switching channels to browse the program, the AD-SURVEY may not consider the channel selection message as effective TV viewing, and may filter such message records from TV viewing analysis 2013.
In another implementation, when the elapsed time is greater than the surfing threshold 2009, suggesting the user may at least spend an amount of time staying on the selected channel, the AD-SURVEY may further determine whether the elapsed time is greater than a capping threshold 2015. For example, when the elapsed time is too long, greater than the capping threshold (e.g., 2 hours, 3 hours, etc.), it may suggest a user may just let the TV on without watching. In such cases, AD-SURVEY may apply capping edit rules to compute a ârealâ watching time 2025. For example, if the elapsed time between a first TV channel switch and a second channel switch is 5 hours, the AD-SURVEY may not log 5 hours as the watching time for the first selected channel, as the capping threshold is 2 hours. The AD-SURVEY may in turn determine the watching time of the first selected channel as capped by a STB/TV off event (e.g., when a STB/TV off event is received during the elapsed time, the watching time may not exceed the timestamp of the STB/TV off event), TV program end time (e.g., when the playing TV program on the first selected channel ends during the elapsed time, the watching time is calculated as the time elapse between the first TV channel event and the TV program end time), and/or the like, e.g., at 2023. In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may apply cutoff thresholds based on historical heuristics via statistical analysis 2023. For example, the AD-SURVEY may determine the watching time based on individual habits, e.g., a user has been observed to stay on the same channel for at most 1 hour, etc. For another example, the cut-off threshold may be analyzed by channel, e.g., 1 hour on CBS, 2 hours on ABC family, and/or the like.
In one implementation, when the elapsed time does not exceed a capping threshold at 2015, and/or when the watching time has been re-calculated based on capping rules at 2025, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve TV program information on the user selected channel 2018, and generate a user channel selection log file 2020. For example, the log file may comprise fields such as user ID, channel ID, channel selection time, user watching time, channel program name, channel program ID, and/or the like. Such generated log files may be fed to a user TV viewing data engine 2030 for audience analytics 219 b. For example, the audience analytics database 219 b may be utilized to analyze TV viewing rates of a TV program, product/brand impression of advertised products during the user watching time, and/or the like. Exemplary audience analytics reports are discussed at FIG. 10A-10H.
the AD-SURVEY server 220 may retrieve TV program information to determine the TV program played on the user selected channel 292. For example, the AD-SURVEY may query on a TV program table (e.g., obtained at 267 at FIG. 2C) based on an instant timestamp and the user selected channel. The AD-SURVEY may log the user channel selection with the timestamp 292 in a database, e.g., at 290 a in FIG. 2A.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may generate TV viewing data for the retrieve TV program 293. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may associate the user selection to the TV viewing rate of the retrieved TV program, and may refine the TV viewing rate with atmospherics analytics at 306. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may monitor groups of audience's channel selection, wherein the audience groups may be defined based on age, geography, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate an audience summary via a dashboard, e.g., see FIG. 8H.
 FIG. 2E provides a logic flow diagram illustrating atmospherics data (e.g., 289 a) analytics within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, upon receiving an atmospherics data message 289 a, the AD-SURVEY server may decode the atmospherics data and obtain atmospherics artifacts 296 a, e.g., a photo, an audio clip, and/or the like. In one implementation, for each decoded artifact, the AD-SURVEY may determine the artifact type 296 b, e.g., based on the file name, file extension, etc.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may incorporate the received device application status (e.g., 2890 for user activity analytics. For example, the AD-SURVEY may capture active application s running on the device 299 a from the received device application data, and determine user activities when viewing 299 b, e.g., emailing, browsing Internet content, texting, video gaming, and/or the like. Such indicated user activity data may be incorporated into audience attendance estimation 2100.
In one implementation, the artifact may comprise a visual data file 297, such as a video file (e.g., âwmv,â âmp4,â âavi,â ârm,â etc.), an image file (e.g., âJPEG,â âbmp,â âtiff,â âgif,â etc.), and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine graphical content 297 of the visual file. For example, the AD-SURVEY may perform image analysis to determine whether the photo image, and/or video frames comprise a scene of audience, and/or a TV screen. In one implementation, a mobile application at the user mobile device, e.g., iPhone, etc., may perform face recognition at a photo taken at an iPhone, and integrate such data in the atmospherics data package, e.g., an iPhoto including two faces, etc. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY server may perform facial recognition to determine audience presence 297 a. In other implementations, the AD-SURVEY server may perform image analysis to determine user activities in the photo image, e.g., reading a book, doing housework, and/or the like. In further implementations, a AD-SURVEY panelist may review the photo image and determine audience status.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether a TV screen image matches the TV program associated with the user channel selection 297 b, e.g., the user may switch to watch recorded program (e.g., TiVo, DVD player, etc.) instead of live TV program on the channel, and in such cases, the AD-SURVEY may not receive an indication of such change. For example, in one implementation, AD-SURVEY may perform image analysis to determine whether the received image photo (and/or a video frame grab) contains a TV screen shot 297 b, e.g., by detecting edges of a rectangular shaped object on the image, etc. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may store a plurality of sample screen shots from the TV program played at the user submitted channel, and may compare the received image photo with each of the stored sample screen shots. In further implementations, a AD-SURVEY panelist may assist in reviewing and determining whether the user TV screen matches the played TV program. In one implementation, if the AD-SURVEY determines the user is absent from a TV set, or engaging in other activities from the graphic analysis, AD-SURVEY may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.
In another implementation, if the received atmospherics data comprises an audio artifact (e.g., with a file extension of âway,â âmp3,â âape,â âm4a,â etc.), the AD-SURVEY may perform audio analysis to determine a content of the audio 298. For example, the AD-SURVEY may analyze the frequency range of the audio content to determine the sound source, e.g., whether it is human voice, ambient noise, media broadcasting, and/or the like.
In one implementation, if the audio content comprises human voice (e.g., within the frequency range 60Ë7000 Hz), the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the human voice is from the audience or broadcasting media. For example, the AD-SURVEY may perform voice recognition to determine whether the human voice matches with any of the characters in the TV program on air on the user submitted channel, e.g., at 298 a.1. If not, the AD-SURVEY may determine such human voices may indicate audience presence 298 a, e.g., whether more than one user is present with the TV set.
In further implementations, if the audio file comprises human voice, the AD-SURVEY may extract verbal content from the audio file to determine whether an audience conversation, or a human conversation from media playing, is related to the TV program on air on the user submitted channel 298 a.2. For example, the AD-SURVEY may adopt speech recognition software (e.g., Nuance, IBM WebSphere Voice, etc.) to extract key terms from the conversation, and compare whether the key terms are related to key words stored with the TV program in the database. For example, if AD-SURVEY extracts key terms âquantum mechanics,â âphysics,â âbig bang,â etc., from the human conversation in the received atmospherics audio artifact, and the user submitted channel CBS is playing âThe Big Bang Theory,â AD-SURVEY may determine the audience is watching the show on air. In such cases, the AD-SURVEY may not need to distinguish whether the human conversation in the audio file is from the audience or TV, but focus on mining the content of the conversation.
In another implementation, if the AD-SURVEY determines the audio artifact comprises ambient noise, AD-SURVEY may determine an environment of the audience 298 b. For example, if the background is overly noisy, the user may not be watching the TV program.
In another implementation, if the AD-SURVEY determines the audio artifact comprises media sound (e.g., music, etc.), the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the audio media content matches the TV program on air on the user submitted channel 298 c via a media recognition software (e.g., a Shazam alike music recognition kit, etc.). For example, if the user selected channel CBS has âThe Big Bang Theoryâ scheduled at the moment, but the AD-SURVEY determines a Lady Gaga song in the received audio atmospherics, this may indicate the user is not watching the TV program. In one implementation, if the AD-SURVEY determines the user is distracted from the TV program based on the audio content, AD-SURVEY may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.
In an alternative implementation, the AD-SURVEY client component, which may be instantiated on a user mobile device (e.g., a downloadable application such as, but not limited to an iPhone application, an Android application, etc.) and/or a table top standalone unit, may obtain atmospherics data to determine the program the user is watching without user indication of the channel. For example, the AD-SURVEY component may obtain audio recording, video recording, signatures image captures, and/or the like of the audience watching environment, and submit the obtained data to AD-SURVEY server. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server may analyze the obtained data to determine what the audience is watching in a similar manner as illustrated at 297, 298 in FIG. 2E, but without the user's channel selection indication.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may perform an audio/video recognition procedure to identify a TV program, e.g., via digital signatures embedded in the program, and/or the like. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may extract key terms from the audio/video captures, and form a query on a database of TV programs to find a match. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may extract textual terms from the obtained audio media program excerpts, such as âbig bang,â âquantum physics,â âSheldon,â etc., and may form a query in a database of TV programs which may return a result indicating the obtained audio media program excerpt may be related to the TV show âBig Bang Theory.â
In an alternative implementation, rather than uploading sampling and/or the entirety of the captured audio/video median content, the AD-SURVEY may analyze the recorded audio/video content to generate a unique signature and/or a unique hash, which may be used for further matching. For example, the unique signature/hash may take a form similar to a sequence of 0-1 representation of a sampling of the recorded media content. In one implementation, the signature/hash generation may be performed at a user device (e.g., the user's mobile phone, the table top unit, etc.), which may upload the generated signature/hash sequence to the AD-SURVEY server. In another implementation, the user device may upload media content sampling, clips or the captured entirety to the AD-SURVEY server, which may then perform the signature generation. Within implementations, software tools/components such as, but not limited to i-brainz, and/or the like may be adopted to generate audio signature/hash.
In further implementations, such âlisten-inâ activities may be performed on a standalone table unit, which may communicate with a user computer via a wireless network, and/or transmit the âlisten-inâ results to the AD-SURVEY server.
In further implementations, lighting sensor data 299 c may indicate the lighting condition of the user environment to determine the viewing status. GPS information contained in the atmospherics data may indicate whether the user is located with the home TV 299 d, e.g., by comparing the instant GPS location with a registered user residential address, etc.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may analyze the variety of atmospherics data to determine whether the user should be accorded as a âviewerâ of the real-time TV program on air. In one implementation, as shown in FIG. 2H, the AD-SURVEY server may adopt a procedure to generate a progressive weighted sum of atmospherics scores to determine whether the user is âwatchingâ or ânot watching.â When the weighted sum of different atmospherics scores exceeds a predetermined threshold, the user may be considered ânot watching,â and the AD-SURVEY may not need to proceed with further atmospherics analysis to improve efficiency of the atmospherics analytics.
For example, at 299 d in FIG. 2H (e.g., comparing received user GPS information with the user's registered residential address in FIG. 2D), the AD-SURVEY may determine an address type 2163, and may assign a weight to the GPS atmospherics factor based on the address type from an atmospherics GPS weight table 2164. For example, the atmospherics GPS weight table may assign 0.1 to a residential address, 0.2 to a Starbucks store, 1.0 to an outdoor address (e.g., a national park, etc.), and/or the like. In one example, the AD-SURVEY may assign a GPS factor weighing score similar to the following table:

In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may calculate the atmospherics score 2200, which may be the assigned GPS weight at this stage, and determine whether the score is greater than a predetermined threshold (e.g., 1, etc.) 2205. If so, the AD-SURVEY may conclude the user is not watching the TV and quit scoring 2300. Otherwise, the AD-SURVEY may proceed with analyzing device app analytics data at 299 a, and repeat the process of updating atmospherics score to determine whether a threshold has been met to suggest the user is not watching.
At 2165, the AD-SURVEY may determine an active application type 2165, and assign a weight based on the application type 2168. For example, an active gaming application may be accorded 0.7; an active email application may be accorded 0.5; an active internet browser may be accorded 0.5, and/or the like:

In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may calculate an updated atmospherics score 2170 and determine whether it exceeds the threshold 2175. If it has not exceeded the threshold, the AD-SURVEY may proceed with audio analytics results from 298, provided such audio analytics is available from the atmospherics data. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve and/or determine audio analytics indications 2178, e.g., ambient noise level, media music which does not match the TV program on air, human voice chatting on irrelevant topics, etc. In one example, the AD-SURVEY may assign a weight based on audio analytics indications 2180 similar to the following table:

In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may update the atmospherics score 2185 by adding the audio scores to determine whether it exceeds the threshold 2190. Otherwise, AD-SURVEY may proceed to perform graphical analytics at 297 a/b given such visual data is available. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve and/or determine visual analytics indications 2192, e.g., user activity, user presence, number of individuals, TV screenshot, etc. In one example, the AD-SURVEY may assign a weight based on visual analytics indications 2195 similar to the following table:

In one implementation, if the updated score 2193 does not exceed the threshold, the AD-SURVEY may conclude the user is watching the TV program 2305, and feed such indication to 2100 for studying TV viewing rates. Otherwise, the AD-SURVEY may conclude the user is not watching 2300, and may not count the user as a âviewerâ of the TV program.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may process the decoded atmospherics data based on a progressive mechanism, to reduce processing complexity. For example, as shown in FIG. 2I, the AD-SURVEY may start with a less complicated analysis of GPS information, device application status, and progressively proceed with visual data processing with a higher complexity.
 FIG. 2F shows a logic diagram illustrating user-server interactions of âlisten-inâ within alternative embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY may instantiate âlisten-inâ when a user has submitted a channel selection to determine whether the user is watching the selected channel. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may periodically check the listen-in data (e.g., every 30 minutes, etc.).
Within embodiments, the user's mobile device may capture image, audio data, video data, GPS coordinates and/or the like 2105. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY client component may automatically configure the user device to capture atmospherics data, e.g., obtaining GPS coordinates, capturing audio data, capturing device application status data, etc. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY client component may prompt a request for the user to hold up the mobile device to position the camera for image/video capturing of the TV screen, the audience scene, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may extract identifying information from the captured monitoring data 2106, such as a hardware ID, MAC address, and/or the like. The AD-SURVEY may determine whether there is any external event 2108, e.g., the user is sending a response to survey question, submitting a channel selection, etc. If there is such external event 2108, the AD-SURVEY may launch the event and embed the atmospherics information into the user responses 2110 for transmission. For example, in one implementation, the embedded atmospherics data may have the same timestamp as the original user response data payload.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may aggregate, and packetize different atmospherics data 2113 in a compliant data format for transmission to the AD-SURVEY server (e.g., see 239 in FIG. 2B).
In one implementation, upon receiving a message from the user device 2115, the AD-SURVEY server may determine the message type 2118. In one implementation, if the message is an atmospherics data packet 2120, the AD-SURVEY server may decode and analyze the atmospherics data packet 2123 to extract information as to the user's viewing status. For example, the AD-SURVEY server may perform an optical character recognition (OCR) procedure on a photographic frame extracted from the received atmospherics data to determine whether the TV program played on TV matches the program schedule associated with the user's selected channel., e.g., whether the program is âcorrectâ 2125. For example, if the user has submitted a selection of channel âCBS,â the AD-SURVEY may query on a program table to determine that âThe Big Bang Theoryâ shall be on air at the timestamp when the atmospherics data is received. The AD-SURVEY may then ascertain whether the received photo of the user's TV set indicates the show on TV is âThe Big Bang Theory.â
In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the user is watching 2128. For example, the AD-SURVEY may perform OCR on the received graphic data (e.g., photos, video clips, etc.) to determine whether the user is present in front of the TV. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may determine how many users are watching the TV program by being present. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the user is present in front of his home TV by analyzing the received GPS coordinates, e.g., when the user's GPS coordinates reflects he has migrated from his home address to a second address, it may indicate the user is no longer watching the TV program after submitting channel selection.
In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate viewing data 2130 to determine audience rating of a TV program, wherein analysis of the atmospherics data may contribute to the viewing statistics.
 FIG. 2G provides a logic flow diagram illustrating non-live media consumption message (e.g., 289 e) analytics within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, a user may submit a non-live media registration request 2150 to the AD-SURVEY, e.g., the user may register TiVo, etc. so that AD-SURVEY may fold the viewing data of non-live media into TV viewing data analytics. In another implementation, the user may select a channel that comprises on-demand video service. In one implementation, upon sending a request, the user device may submit the user external IP (e.g., the IP address of the user mobile device, etc.), internal IP address (e.g., the IP address of the TiVo facility, a set-top box, etc.) to the AD-SURVEY for registration 2155. The user device may further provide a media access key to AD-SURVEY as authorization credentials for remote monitoring of the user's non-live media facility. In further implementations, the user may configure parameters of the facility (e.g., a set-top box, etc) as shown in FIGS. 7I-J.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may register the user's non-live media facility 2156, and may establish a secure communication channel with the non-live media facility. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may receive a non-live media schedule 2158, which may be automatically downloaded from the user's non-live media (e.g., media on-demand, Internet TV streaming service such as ABC episodes, Hulu.com, etc.), and/or provided by the user (e.g., a list of recorded programs for replay).
In one implementation, upon receiving an indication of non-live media selection 289 e, the AD-SURVEY platform may check the program table to determine the TV program on the non-live media 2160, and log the user channel selection of an associated TV program with a timestamp 2125. The AD-SURVEY may also obtain and analyze atmospherics data 2123, e.g., in a similar manner as discussed in FIG. 2D, to generate TV viewing data for the selected TV program 2127.
 FIG. 2I provides a logic flow diagram illustrating user mobile device as a TV remote (e.g., 235 a in FIG. 2A) within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, a user may plug a AD-SURVEY infrared accessory (e.g., 120 in FIG. 1B) into a user mobile device 2500. The user mobile device may be a general purpose personal device (e.g., as opposed to a dedicated TV remote facility, etc.), such as, but not limited to an Apple iPhone, iTouch, iPod, iPad, BlackBerry, Palm, HTC Evo, Google Android, Samsung Galaxy, and/or the like. The user may instantiate a AD-SURVEY client component on the user device 2505 (e.g., see FIGS. 7A-7L, etc.), wherein the AD-SURVEY client component may determine whether an infrared plug-in is available 2510. If so, the user device may initiate an automatic scan on its communication stack for TVs/DVDs 2515. If the query returns a TV/DVD is available 2520, the user device may obtain a physical address of the scanned facility, and determine a type of the facility 2523, wherein such information may be logged into a communication stack 2528. In another implementation, if no results come out of the automatic scan at 2520, the user device may obtain user submitted TV/DVD parameters 2525 (e.g., TV/DVD brand, type, etc.), and adjust the scanning mode based on the user submitted parameters 2526.
Upon establishing communication with a TV/DVD set, the user device may monitor on user's channel submission 2530. When a channel selection is obtained, the user device may transmit a channel selection indication to the logged TV/DVD address via the infrared plug-in accessory 2535. In this manner, the user may operate a general purpose mobile device as a TV/DVD remote.
 FIG. 3A shows a block diagram illustrating data flows between AD-SURVEY entities within alternative embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Continuing on from FIGS. 2A and 2B, in one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY may receive a list of real time TV program 237 a from the TV network 270, and a list of advertisement tags 243 a associated with the TV programs 237 a. For example, for each TV media program, which may comprise both segments of TV programs (e.g., a TV play) and a plurality of advertisements (e.g., interleaved during the TV play broadcasting). For another example, the advertisement tags 243 a may label embedded advertisement in a scene of the TV play, e.g., a pair of sunglasses carried by a character in the TV show âThe Big Bang Theoryâ may comprise a product placement advertisement tag. In a further implementation, for product placements, the ad tags 343 a may comprise video frame grabs with embedded graphic indications of the placed products in the scene, e.g., see FIG. 7G.
For example, in one implementation, the TV media program table 237 a (e.g., see also 237 a in FIGS. 2A-2B) may comprise a sub-table comprising embedded advertisement tags. For example, in one implementation, an exemplary XML record of a media program data structure with ad tags 343 a may take a form similar to the following:

The above XML example shows a media program âThe Big Bang Theory season 3, episode 2â which is scheduled to be on air on CBS at 9 pm on Sep. 9, 2000. The example media program comprise an ad tag which may be a regular advertisement (e.g., non-product placement or embedded in the scene) of Audi automobile, and another ad tag which may be an embedded product placement, e.g., a âpair of XYZ-designer sunglassesâ as shown in a scene during the TV program (e.g., see FIG. 7G). In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may redirect the user to a URL âwww.buybags.com/XYZ/spring2000â if the user clicks to learn more about the product. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate synchronized advertisement to a user based on the ad tag by providing a pop-up static ad 338 b, e.g., âDo you like Penny's sunglasses?â (e.g., see 720 b in FIG. 7F). In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate an interactive ad 338 b including a tagged screenshot of the TV program containing the placed product (e.g., see 750 c in FIG. 7G).
In another embodiment, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may generate questions 338 b synchronized and/or related to the TV program ads 343 a, which may be devised by the AD-SURVEY based on the media content the user has viewed, the advertisement the user has viewed, and/or the like. For example, if the channel the user has been watching recently has played advertisement of âAudi,â the AD-SURVEY may prompt a question to the user such as âwhich brand automobile would you prefer?â to determine the advertisement effects. In another example, the user 233 a may receive real-time information synchronized with a product placement embedded in the TV program. For example, when a user is watching a TV show, he may receive a prompt question 338 b related to an embedded advertisement in a scene of the TV show, e.g., âDo you want to learn more about Penny's sunglasses?â In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may redirect the user to a URL âwww.buythings.com/XYZ-designer/spring2000â if the user clicks to learn more about the product.
For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may provide a HTTPS PUT message including the questionnaire 338 b in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including an XML-formatted questions 338 b to provide to the user 233 a:

In one embodiment, upon receiving questions and/or ads at the mobile device, the user may submit a response 339 to the AD-SURVEY server, e.g., an answer to the question, a click on the provided ad URL, and/or the like. In another implementation, upon viewing an embedded advertisement while watching a TV program, the user 233 a may desire to learn more or purchase the product, and submit a request of purchase 365 a (e.g., by clicking on âBuy it Nowâ 750 c in FIG. 7G) to the AD-SURVEY server 220. The AD-SURVEY 220 may forward the purchase request 365 b to a merchant website 280, and redirect the user to view the merchant site to obtain more information of the interested product. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may log the user question responses, indication of interests, purchase transaction, and/or the like at the database 219 to indicate ad effects.
For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may provide a HTTPS PUT message including the questionnaire response 339 b, purchase request 365 a in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including an XML-formatted questions responses/purchasing request to provide to the database 219:

In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may populate social media feeds of the user's questionnaire responses/purchase information 365 b to a social media platform 250. In another implementation, the user may share purchase information 238 to the social media 250. For example, the user's Facebook news feeds may comprise a message âXXX participated in a survey. See her responseâ (e.g., see 731 c in FIG. 7C). The user may also obtain his friends' AD-SURVEY activities, including participation in surveys, purchases 349, etc., from social media news feed.
 FIG. 3B provides a logic flow diagram illustrating generating a survey question within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, upon user submitting a channel selection 305, the AD-SURVEY server may check program table to determine what's on air on the selected channel 306, and retrieve a program table to obtain ads tagged in the selected TV program 307.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may parse commercial ad information on the selected channel 308 a, to extract key terms. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve the advertised product brand name, product name, category, etc. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may query on a questionnaire database based on the parsed ad key terms 310. For example, for an âAudiâ commercial, the AD-SURVEY may parse key terms as âAudi,â âcar,â âautomobile,â and select and generate pop-up questions related to such key terms to the user 312.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may incorporate a variety of user media content exposure data to generate media content based survey questions 308 b. For example, AD-SURVEY may incorporate mobile ads exposure data (e.g., user web visits, AD-SURVEY generated mobile ads, etc.), user application status (e.g., browsing history, Internet gaming content, etc.), social content (e.g., social pages, social ads, friends' recommendations, user' likes, etc.) 305 b, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may receive the various user content exposure data from a AD-SURVEY client component instantiated on the user mobile device, e.g., an iPhone app, etc. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may receive mobile data from a mobile meter, a proxy server, a TV metering system, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate synchronized pop-up survey questions to the user. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may analyze the ad tags prior to the TV program on air, and prepare pop-up questions associated with each ad tag. The generated pop-up questions may be sent to the user according to the timetable of the ad tags. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve the user's viewing history, e.g., the TV programs the user has recently watched, etc., and determine the ads associated with the TV programs the user has watched to generate non-synchronized pop-up survey questions.
Upon receiving the pop-up survey question 313, the user may elect to submit a response 315, which may indicate ad effects. In further implementations, the survey questions may be generated based on advertisement the user has exposed to (e.g., via cross-channel ad measurement, as further illustrated in FIG. 7E), social media contents, and/or the like.
 FIG. 3C provides a logic flow diagram illustrating generating product placement ads within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, continuing on with retrieving ad tags in the TV program on air on the user selected channel 307, the AD-SURVEY server may query on what ads are available 328 in an ad database. For example, the AD-SURVEY may obtain a list of ad tags and it associated types, whether a screen shot for product placement is available, etc. In one implementation, if there is a synchronized ad tag 330, the AD-SURVEY may prepare synchronized ad generation prior to the timestamp of the ad tag 333. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may determine an ad type 335, e.g., whether it is static ad or interactive ad. In one implementation, if it is a static ad, the AD-SURVEY may select a static ad template and populate the product information into the template, and provide a textual pop-up ad at a synchronized time 340 to the user. In another implementation, if the ad tag indicates an interactive ad is available, AD-SURVEY may retrieve a tagged screenshot associated with the interactive ad tag. For another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate a video frame grab comprising the product placement tags 338 via video frame grabbing software (e.g., Windows Media Player, Quicktime Player, etc.). In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve an interactive ad template and populate the video frame into the template to provide the interactive ad (e.g., see FIG. 7G) at a synchronized time 342 to the user.
In one implementation, if the TV program at the user submitted channel contains no synchronized ad tags 330, the AD-SURVEY may elect not to send ads/questions to the user. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve user's recent viewing history (e.g., the past week, etc.), and generate a non-synchronized ad/survey question to the user based on the user's recently viewed TV programs. In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may re-send ads that were synchronized with one of user's recently viewed TV programs to the user.
In further implementations, the synchronized product placement ads may be applied to in-game ads in a similar manner. For example, the AD-SURVEY may determine a user is engaging in a gaming application via the received device application event (e.g., 241 in FIG. 2B), and deliver an interactive advertisement of related virtual goods, e.g., gaming points, widget, etc., to the user mobile device.
 FIG. 3D shows a logic flow diagram illustrating ad synchronization question message processing (e.g., 289 c) within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, upon receiving a message from a user and determining the type of the message as an ad/question response 289 c, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the received message comprise a response to a survey question 362.
In another implementation, if the received message comprises responses to prompt questions 362, the AD-SURVEY may determine a classification of the question 365, e.g., a response to survey, a response to embedded advertisement, and/or the like. In another implementation, the question responses may be classified by the products, e.g., automobiles, apparels, electronics, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may extract a questionnaire ID and/or a survey ID 366 from the received user response, and store the questionnaire results 368 associated matched with the questionnaire based on an ID query.
In a further implementation, the user who responds to questionnaires may be credited for a reward. For example, after obtaining and storing questionnaire results, the AD-SURVEY may determine rewards for the user 370, e.g., five AD-SURVEY points for each question answered, etc., and credit the points to the user's AD-SURVEY account 372. In another implementations, the rewards may comprise virtual currency (e.g., store points, gaming points, etc.), coupons, discounts, and/or the like, sponsored by an advertising merchant.
In another implementation, when the AD-SURVEY determines the response does not comprise a response to a survey question at 362, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether it comprises an interactive activity indication 376. For example, a user may submit a rating of the product with the interactive ad, click on the interactive ad, and/or the like. In one implementation, if the user submits a purchase request 378, the AD-SURVEY may provide a merchant URL, and/or direct the user to a merchant page to proceed with purchase transaction 377 a. The AD-SURVEY may log user activities associated with the product placement advertisement 377 b, e.g., with an ad ID, etc.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may aggregate data analysis results from all different types of messages received from the user and run aggregate analytics 375 for ad effects. FIG. 3E provides a logic flow diagram illustrating ad delivery/effects analysis within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. For example, in one implementation, AD-SURVEY may obtain a correlation of an advertisement and user perception of the product, based on responses to the survey question (e.g., if a user selects âAudiâ in an automobile survey, after viewing an âAudiâ advertisement, etc.). In further implementation, AD-SURVEY may generate an ad effect score for each advertisement.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may retrieve an advertisement and determine an ad classification 380, e.g., a category of the advertised product (e.g., apparel, accessories, automobile, electronics, etc.). For example, for an âAudiâ advertisement, the AD-SURVEY may query for stored questions (e.g., 368 in FIG. 3D) results with the ad classification âautomobileâ 381. If such survey responses are available 382, the AD-SURVEY may query the retrieved survey responses for mentions of the product 383, e.g., on a brand name âAudi,â on a make and model of the âAudiâ automobile, etc. For each response, the AD-SURVEY may determine a relevance of the question and question results 382. For example, the AD-SURVEY may retrieve the corresponding question with the question results based on a question ID (e.g., stored at in FIG. 3E), and perform text analytics to determine a relevance level of the question to the brand name product âAudiâ automobile (e.g., based on whether the question contains key terms such as âpreference,â âcar purchase,â etc.). In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine an ad effect weight value for the response 385. For example, the AD-SURVEY may perform text analytics of the question and questions results, and if the textual question/question results contain key terms such as âcar purchaseâ and âAudi,â such response may be accorded with a high weight value. In one implementation, the weighting value determination at 385 may be based on a pre-stored weight evaluation table, e.g., 0.5 for submitting a response of âAudi,â 0.8 for clicking on a merchant site, 50.0 for transacting a sale on an âAudiâ automobile,â etc., and calculate an impact score of the advertisement based on a group of users (e.g., see 1019I at FIG. 10). The AD-SURVEY may generate an ad effect sub-score based on analytics of user survey responses 386 a, e.g., taking a weighted sum, etc.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may query for stored user activities (e.g., stored at 377 b in FIG. 3D) in response to an ad (e.g., purchasing request, click for more information, etc.) base on an ad ID 382. If such activities are available 387, the AD-SURVEY may determine a type of the activity 388, e.g., clicks on the ad for more information, clicks on a provided merchant URL, user rating of the advertised product, clicks on âBuy It Now,â closing the ad without browsing, and/or the like. Based on the activity type, the AD-SURVEY may associate a weight value for the activity 389, and generate an ad effect sub-score based on analytics of user activities 386 b, e.g., taking a weighted sum, etc. For example, a click on a merchant URL may be accorded with a high positive weight value; and a prompt window close of the ad may be accorded with a low or zero weight value, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate an indication of ad effects 390 based on an integrated ad effects score (e.g., taking a sum of the subscores from 386 a and 387 b, etc.).
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may compare the ad effects score of the same ad on different media channel, to determine efficiency of the ad placement. For example, if the same âAudiâ ad has a higher impact score on channel âESPNâ than âDisney,â it may provide heuristics to the merchant that such advertisement is more efficient on âESPN.â In further implementations, AD-SURVEY may determine efficiency of the time and the TV program to place the advertisement based on the ad effects score.
 FIG. 4A provides a block diagram illustrating a AD-SURVEY client component 401 within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, a AD-SURVEY component 401 may contain a number of sub-components and/or data stores. A AD-SURVEY client controller 405 may serve a central role in some embodiments of AD-SURVEY operation, serving to orchestrate the reception, generation, and distribution of data and/or instructions to, from and between client mobile device(s) and/or the server via AD-SURVEY components and in some instances mediating communications with external entities and systems.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY controller 405 and/or the different components may be instantiated on a user mobile device, e.g., an Apple iPhone, etc. In an alternative embodiment, the controller may be housed separately from other components and/or databases within the AD-SURVEY system, while in another embodiment, some or all of the other modules and/or databases may be housed within and/or configured as part of the AD-SURVEY controller. Further detail regarding implementations of AD-SURVEY controller operations, modules, and databases is provided below.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY controller 405 may be coupled to one or more interface components and/or modules. In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY Controller may be coupled to a user interface (UI) 410. The user interface 410 may be configured to receive user inputs and display application states and/or other outputs. The UI may, for example, allow a user to adjust AD-SURVEY system settings, select communication methods and/or protocols, manually enter texts, engage mobile device application features, and/or the like. In one implementation, the user interface 410 may include, but not limited to devices such as, keyboard(s), mouse, stylus(es), touch screen(s), digital display(s), and/or the like. In another implementation, the user questionnaire component 430 may provide user survey questions and receive user responses via the user interface 410.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY Controller 405 may further be coupled to a sensor module 420, configured to interface with and/or process signals from sensor input/output (I/O) components 425. The sensor I/O components 425 may be configured to obtain information of environmental conditions, and/or the like to generate atmospherics data that may be received and/or processed by other AD-SURVEY components. A wide variety of different sensors may be compatible with AD-SURVEY operation and may be integrated with sensor I/O components 425, such as but not limited to a camera, an audio recorder, a GPS component, and/or the like, configured to capture video clips/photos of what is playing on the TV and/or whether the user is watching the program, audio recording clips indicative of what is playing on the TV, GPS information indicative of the user's location, and/or the like. In one implementation, the Media Listen-In Component 440 may configure, aggregate and packetize atmospherics data captured by the sensor module component 420 in a data format suitable for data transmission via the sensor I/O 425. In a further implementation, the Media Listen-In Component 440 may process and analyze the obtained atmospherics data, e.g., a photo captured by the mobile device, etc., to identify whether the user is watching, and/or how many individuals are watching from the photo, via image processing. For example, in one embodiment, the iPhone SDK toolkit and/or runtime libraries may be installed and/or used to perform such image processing.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY Controller 405 may further be coupled to a communications module 430, configured to interface with and/or process data transmission from communications I/O components 435. The communications I/O components 435 may comprise components facilitating transmission of electronic communications via a variety of different communication protocols and/or formats as coordinated with and/or by the communications module 430. Communication I/O components 440 may, for example, contain ports, slots, antennas, amplifiers, and/or the like to facilitate transmission of TV program listing information, user submission of channel selection, user responses to survey questions, and/or the like, via any of the aforementioned methods. Communication protocols and/or formats for which the communications module 230 and/or communications IO components 435 may be compatible may include, but are not limited to, GSM, GPRS, W-CDMA, CDMA, CDMA2000, HSDPA, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, and/or the like. In various implementations, the communication I/O 435 may, for example, serve to configure data into application, transport, network, media access control, and/or physical layer formats in accordance with a network transmission protocol, such as, but not limited to FTP, TCP/IP, SMTP, Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) and/or the like. The communications module 430 and communications I/O 435 may further be configurable to implement and/or translate Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), VoIP and/or the like data formats and/or protocols. The communications I/O 435 may further house one or more ports, jacks, antennas, and/or the like to facilitate wired and/or wireless communications with and/or within the AD-SURVEY system. For example, the communication I/O 432 may be extended by a plug-in accessory as shown at 120 in FIG. 1.
Numerous data transfer protocols may also be employed as AD-SURVEY connections, for example, TCP/IP and/or higher protocols such as HTTP post, FTP put commands, and/or the like. In one implementation, the communications module 430 may comprise web server software equipped to configure application state data for publication on the World Wide Web. Published application state data may, in one implementation, be represented as an integrated video, animation, rich internet application, and/or the like configured in accordance with a multimedia plug-in such as Adobe Flash. In another implementation, the communications module 430 may comprise remote access software, such as Citrix, Virtual Network Computing (VNC), and/or the like equipped to configure user application (e.g., a user mobile device). In another implementation, the communications module 430 may transmit TV program listing information to the real time TV remote control component 415, which may in turn receives user channel selection form the user interface 410.
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY 405 may be configured to communicate with a content based embedded advertising component 420, media content questionnaire synchronization component 435, and/or the like (as further discussed in FIGS. 3B and 3C).
 FIG. 4B provides a combined logic and data flow diagram illustrating AD-SURVEY client and server interactions within embodiment of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, the TV remote control component 415 may submit a channel selection event 416 to the AD-SURVEY server 450, which may in turn query a media program database 419 for TV program information. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 450 may form a first query 417 on a media program table 419 a based on the user's channel selection, to determine the TV program the user is watching and send such program information 418 back to the user; and a second query on an Ad Tags table 419 b to determine what advertisement and embedded product placement advertisement the user may received during the TV program streaming. The queried results, including the program information and ad information, may be fed into an Ad synchronization component 455 at the AD-SURVEY server 450, which may generate ad synchronization popup questions 421 based on the ad the user may be watching.
In one implementation, the generated ad synchronization questions 421 may be received and provided to the user via a user interface generated by the user questionnaire component 430 on the user's mobile device, which may in turn provide user's response events 422 to an Ad effect engine component 460 at the MR-PLATOFRM server 450 to analyze advertisement effects.
In one embodiment, the media listen-in component 440 may collect and aggregate atmospherics data 423, e.g., video recording clips, audio recording clips, photo streams, GPS information, and/or the like, to a media viewing statistics analysis component 465, which may analyze the media viewing data, and determine the audience reception rate of a TV program and/or advertisement.
In a further implementation, the social media connection component 445 may generate and transmit social media post 448 indicating the user's viewing status to a social media database 469, and may optionally send the social media post to the AD-SURVEY 450 as well. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 450 may obtain the user's social media status updates information, including friends' recommendations, comments, and/or the like via an API call 471 to the social media database 469. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 450 may redirect a user to the social media website 472 from the user's instantiated AD-SURVEY client component to engage in social media activities. For example, the user may click on a social media link via the AD-SURVEY client component user interface and be redirected to the social media page.
 FIG. 4C provides a block diagram illustrating an example infrastructure of a AD-SURVEY table top unit component within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. Within implementations, the table top device 473 may be a standalone device that may be placed on a desk, wherein the user may be requested to place it to face the screen of a TV set or the TV STB. In one implementation, the table top device 473 may communicate with a user mobile device, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and/or the like, via a Bluetooth transmitter/receiver interface 472-474. In one implementation via Bluetooth connection 476. a user may download and install a remote control mobile application 471. In another implementation, the table top device 473 may communicate with a TV set 483, a set top box 486, DVR equipment, and/or the like, via infrared transmitter/receiver interfaces 475, 485/487 via infrared connection 481. In one implementation, the table top device 473 may comprise a rechargeable battery 478 for power supplies from charging inputs 480.
The table top device 473 may facilitate mobile remote control to operate in a similar manner as the AD-SURVEY accessory 1120 in FIG. 1B. Instead of being plugged into a user mobile device, the table top device 473 may communicate with a user device running the remote mobile application 471 via wireless connections. For example, the table top device may be operated for remote TV channel control, collecting atmospherics data for audience monitoring, and/or the like. In further implementations, the table top device may be positioned so that the table top device may capture images from the screen of the TV set.
In one implementation, the table top device may be configured to periodically monitor audio contents, video contents, etc., in the atmosphere, with or without having user input of a channel selection. For example, the table top device may record an audio/video clip of media program being played, and send such audio/video clip (or generate a signature/hash based on sampling of the recorded audio/video media content) to the AD-SURVEY server, which may in turn determine what the user is watching. Further implementations are discussed in FIG. 2E.
 FIGS. 5A-5B provide combined data flow and logic flow diagrams illustrating data downloads from social media platforms within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. Within implementations, AD-SURVEY may obtain social media data to measure, and/or influence consumer consumption of media and advertising. For example, AD-SURVEY may track social media discussion to obtain comments, mentions, responses related to an object under evaluation (e.g., a brand name product, a TV show, etc.). In one implementation, a user may befriend with panelists to âFriendâ on Facebook, and/or allow a panelist on Twitter, wherein the panelist may be a AD-SURVEY personnel, and/or an avatar, etc. The AD-SURVEY may then obtain users' conversations, wall posts, pages of brands/products the user follows, products/content the user âlikeâ, social advertising the user has been exposed to, clicks on pages, etc., to obtain social media exposure data. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may incorporate comments of representative panelists, identification of friends across panel, social activities profiling of panel, and/or the like.
In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may track social media content (e.g., Facebook and Twitter, etc.) of AD-SURVEY consumers, e.g., users who has authorized AD-SURVEY to access their social media content. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may link demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal data from the user's profile information with social media behavior. The social media data downloading may be obtained via API calls, as discussed in FIGS. 5A-5B.
In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may recruit consumers (e.g., Facebook, Twitter users who have allow AD-SURVEY to access their social content) as AD-SURVEY panelists, e.g., by providing incentive rewards to the users, etc. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may track how social media messages propagate throughout a network of social media users (e.g., the recruited panelists, etc.), based on the profiles of the individuals. Such measures of connectivity may be analyzed to measure propagation of marketing communications.
In another implementation, each panelist may be associated with a social media specific profile so that their social media activities may be tracked to determine whether they are influencers in certain categories, disseminators of information, information consumers, and/or the like. For example, in one implementation, a panelist may be labeled as a âThe Big Bang Theory Fan Wiki,â so that users interested in the show âThe Big Bang Theoryâ may follow the panelist to obtain information of the show via the panelist's posts, comments, and/or the like, related to âThe Big Bang Theory.â
In one implementation, individual social media profiles may be incorporated to assess advertising targeting performance, enable advertisers to plan social media campaigns by targeting product influencers, and/or the like.
As shown in FIG. 5A, AD-SURVEY server 220 may send an access request to a social media platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.) for access to a user's profile information and social media content, e.g., news feeds, posted photos, Tweets, comments, activities (âLikes,â âDislikes,â etc.).
In one implementation, upon receiving the access request 505, the social media 250 may generate and send a user authorization request 510 to the user 233 a. For example, Facebook and/or Twitter may send an email to the user 233 a, wherein the email may comprise an authorization link directing the user to a AD-SURVEY authorization page (e.g., as included in the access request 505). In one implementation, the user 233 a may be access the included authorization link via a mobile application UI 511 a (e.g., see FIG. 8A), and/or a web based application UI 511 b (e.g., see FIG. 8B). As shown in FIG. 8A, the user may click âAllowâ to grant permission of AD-SURVEY to access the user's social media content. In further implementation, as shown at 827 in FIG. 8C, the user may configure a scope of information the AD-SURVEY may be allowed to access.
For example, in one implementation, the user's mobile application and/or a web-based application may generate a (Secure) HTTPS PUT authorization message 515 including an application ID and permission indication for the social media platform in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including the XML-formatted access authorization message provide to Facebook:

In the above example, the authorization message to Facebook may comprise information as to the scope of information access, e.g., the user may permit AD-SURVEY to access the user âJDOE'sâ Facebook profile including his name, age, date of birth, work an education information, interested pages, network, and/or the like; a number of friends of âJDOE,â but may not access an exact friends list. The user may allow AD-SURVEY to obtain âJDOE'sâ posts on his own wall, but may not permit access to his posts on his friends' wall or friends' comments on his wall, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the social media 250 may pass on the application ID from the user's mobile or web application and generate a user token 518 to AD-SURVEY for confirmation of access permission. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine when data update is needed 520, e.g., the data update from social media may be performed on a periodic basis (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.). The AD-SURVEY server 220 may generate a data request 522 together with the received user authorization token (e.g., 518) and transmit to the social media platform.
In one implementation, the data request 522 may be sent to the social media platform via a user oAuth protocol, and comprise a AD-SURVEY application ID, and/or a user social media ID, and/or the like. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may provide a (Secure) HTTPS PUT message including a data request 522 for Facebook in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including the XML-formatted access request provide to Facebook:

In the above example, the data request generated by AD-SURVEY to Facebook may comprise a user ID âJDOEâ indicating the request is directed to Facebook information of the user âJDOEâ; a client ID indicating the application (e.g., the AD-SURVEY mobile application ID, etc.) indicating a source of the request; and a URL link which may be provided to the user for authorization, e.g., a link that requests the user to click a âOKâ or âCancelâ button on the page to authorize or deny AD-SURVEY to gain access to the user's Facebook content. The access request may further comprise information as to the scope of information access, e.g., AD-SURVEY may request to access the user âJDOE'sâ Facebook profile including his name, age, date of birth, work an education information, interested pages, network, and/or the like. The AD-SURVEY may also request to obtain information of a number of friends of âJDOE,â but may not request to access an exact friends list. The AD-SURVEY may further request to obtain âJDOE'sâ posts on his own wall, but may not request to obtain his posts on his friends' wall or friends' comments on his wall, and/or the like.
For another example, in one implementation, the AD-SURVEY server 220 may provide a (Secure) HTTPS PUT message including a data request 522 for Twitter server in the form of data formatted according to the XML. Below is an example HTTP(S) PUT message including the XML-formatted access request provide to Twitter:

In the above example of data request to Twitter, the request may comprise a user signature request. For example, a user may provide electronic signature by clicking on a link (e.g., at 515, etc.) noting âI hereby provide my signature by pressing this button to allow AD-SURVEY access my Twitter content,â etc.
In one implementation, upon verification of the data request by Facebook/Twitter/other social media platform, AD-SURVEY server 220 may download social media structured data 525 a and unstructured data 525 b (e.g., see 571 a-b in FIG. 5B) for media analytics.
 FIG. 5B shows a block diagram illustrating an example infrastructure map of AD-SURVEY media analytics within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may provide a media analytics and reporting platform portal 570 for analyzing TV, Internet, mobile and social media data upon client request, e.g., analyzing public feedbacks and comments on a brand name products, TV shows, and/or the like. In one implementation, the media measurement and analytics portal platform 570 may provide class visualization, self service administration with seamless integration between the different architectural components, e.g., 570 a and 570 b, etc.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY media measurement portal 570 may load data from social networks via a HTTP network 578 via API calls, e.g., Facebook APPI 580 a, Twitter API 580 b, Google+API 580 c, and other social data providers 580 d. The media measurement portal 570 may process the loaded data within different analytics platforms 570 a/b based on loaded data types, e.g., structured data 571 a or unstructured data 571 b.  
For example, in one implementation, structured data 571 a may be already stored in a structured format when loaded from the data source, such as, but not limited to user TV channel selection indication with timestamp, web displaying content with timestamp, social media user profile information, a number of user's social connections (time stamped), a posted photo on social media platform with timestamp, and/or the like. For example, an exemplary XML record of structured Facebook user profile data 571 a downloaded from Facebook may take a form similar to the following:

In one implementation, the analytics platform for processing structured data may store the structured data, such as TV channel selection, mobile/web content data, social network user profile data, etc. in a database 575 a.  
For another example, unstructured data 571 b may comprise raw text downloaded from social media platform, e.g., friends' comments from Facebook, original Tweets, etc. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY social analytics platform 570 b may perform data mining on unstructured data 571 b to measure user feedbacks of a brand name product, TV program, etc. For example, a query may be performed on the unstructured data 571 b to determine how many mentions of âThe Big Bang Theoryâ are posted by Facebook users.
For example, in one implementation, an exemplary XML record of unstructured Facebook user message 571 b downloaded from Facebook may take a form similar to the following:

For further implementations, the unstructured data 571 b may comprise a social post, a social media check-in status, social mentions, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY structured data analytics platform comprises a variety of processing components, such as but not limited to user permission component for social media access 573 a, TV/mobile/web measurement reports component 573 b, media analytics engine 573 c, organization/user account management component 573 d, single source data extraction, transformation and load (ETL) component 573 e, and/or the like. Within implementations, the user permission component may present panel users with a set of user interface screens requesting them to provide permission for AD-SURVEY to access their social content. For example, AD-SURVEY may provide incentives of promotional rewards, points, coupons and/or the like to users during questionnaire distribution (e.g., AD-SURVEY mobile questionnaires 238 a, etc) to allow AD-SURVEY access to their social content.
In one implementation, if the user agrees to provide the access to their social content, the permission component 573 a may get the authorization token from the respective social platforms (Facebook, twitter etc) as per the authorization protocol and persist the token in a repository 575 b. The user permission component 573 a may pass the user token and other application authorization details to social analytics platform so that the user's social content can be extracted at a scheduled frequency. For example, AD-SURVEY may periodically, constantly and/or intermittently load social content data from the social media platforms via API calls once authentication is established. Further implementations of user permission flows are discussed in FIGS. 5A-5B.
In one implementation, the media analytics engine 573 c may analyze the loaded structured data 573 c, e.g., per user profile, per media type, etc. In one implementation, the organization/user management 573 d may create and manage user accounts with the AD-SURVEY. In further implementations, the TV/mobile/web measurement reports component 573 b may generate media measurement reports (e.g., including audience ratings, ad effectiveness, etc.) based on structured media data, such as audience TV channel selections, mobile/web browsing activities, etc.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY unstructured data analytics platform 570 b may have a rule to define the specific fields for which the content needs to be extracted for a given user (e.g. user demographics, no of friends, no of messages in a given duration, actual text for message and comments etc). Based on the authentication token the social media analytics platform 570 b may query the social platform for the content. In one implementation, the social analytics platform 570 b may schedule the query tasks and persist structured and unstructured content that is extracted.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY social analytics platform 570 b may comprise a variety of processing components, such as but not limited to, social media measurement reports component 583 a, taxonomy management console 583 b, text analytics engine 583 c, social media adapters 583 d, social analytics platform API 583 e, and/or the like. The social analytics platform API 583 e may exchange data via API calls 587 with the single source ETL process component 573 e, such as user authorization tokens, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the taxonomy management console 583 b may define taxonomy tags and taxonomy logic rules. For example, the taxonomy may be defined at three different levels: a standard taxonomy specific to an industry and business function as provided by the platform vendor (e.g., tagging a unstructured data record by industry, etc.); taxonomy defined by analyst and subject matter experts (e.g., AD-SURVEY analytics defined taxonomy rules, etc.); and/or taxonomy defined by clients, and/or the like. For example, for a Tweet âGood adaption of the Southern Vampire series. Love the CBS actors/actresses. Expecting the new seasonâ (e.g., 185 in FIG. 1D), the text analytics engine 583 c may apply a taxonomy rule to tag it by a hierarchy of tags âTV show->CBS->The Big Bang Theory->Positive Feedback.â For another example, the client (e.g., CBS, etc.) may desire to categorize the commented target of the Tweet, and therefore the taxonomy rule may comprise an additional sub-category âactor/actresses,â and/or the like. In one implementations, such taxonomy rules may be stored in a repository 585 a, and the original social text data and social graph, tagged social data may be stored at 585 b. Further implementations and applications of the taxonomy rules are discussed in FIGS. 5E-5F.
In one implementation, the social media measurement reports 583 a may provide a user feedback measurement report to a user via UI integration and data visualization. Within implementations, the reporting portal 583 a may leverage the web based visual components (e.g. word cloud, traffic light components etc) provided by the social media analytics platform 570 for analysis that deliver insights purely on social media data. In further implementations, for insights generated on combined data set from social and other data sources (e.g., via data mesh-up 572 between the structured data analytics platform 570 a and unstructured data analytics platform 570 b, etc.) the taxonomy management console 583 b may be integrated to an integrated reporting portal to ensure the clients have the self service capability of defining the taxonomy and building the reports. For example, single sign on and UI widget meshup 572 may be adopted between the two platforms 570 a and 570 b for integration of the two.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY media measurement portal 570 may combine structured social media data with other data sources to generate cross media insights. The social media analytics platform 570 b may have the API to extract data for predefined metrics and attributes (e.g., taxonomy logics, data tags, etc.). The metrics and attributes may be predefined in the social media analytics tool to compute from the structured and unstructured content extracted from the social media platforms.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY media measurement portal 570 may use different platforms for social media reporting and structured data reporting, and have a tight integration at the data and UI layers of both the platforms. Additional implementations of the AD-SURVEY media measurement portal 570 may comprise: out of the box connectors for social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc (e.g., at 583 e, etc.); web based taxonomy creation and management user interfaces; industry specific prebuilt taxonomies (e.g., at 583 b, etc.); text analytics engine with sentiment analysis with learning algorithms (e.g., at 583 c, etc.); ability to define fields for which social content needs to be extracted (e.g., at 583 c, etc.); data API calls to extract large data set in and out of the platform in real time and/or in batch mode (e.g., at 583 d, etc.); data API calls for UI widget integration to create mesh-up (e.g., at 572, etc.); multiple tenant support to ensure taxonomies defined at organization and department level (e.g., at 583 b, etc.); single sign on support with active directory service interfaces (ADSI) and other light weight directory access protocol (LDAP) providers (e.g., at 572, 573 a, etc.); components to generate insights from large historical data (e.g., over two terabytes of data); components to schedule data extraction jobs from social media sites (e.g., at 583 e, etc.); components to support to host the service on a cloud, and/or the like.
 FIG. 5C provide a logic flow diagram of user authorization for social media access and social message (e.g., 289 d at FIG. 2C) processing within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, upon receiving a social message from a user, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the user, and/or the AD-SURVEY is authorized to send social messages to the user's social media platform.
In one implementation, the user 233 a may allow AD-SURVEY platform to access to their social network. For example, in one implementation, the user 233 a may sign up for AD-SURVEY permission via a AD-SURVEY mobile application 511 a from a mobile device (e.g., an Apple iPhone, an Android, etc.). For another example, the user 233 a may visit a AD-SURVEY social data panel management website 511 b (e.g., as illustrated in one example in FIG. 8B). In each case, AD-SURVEY may provide a sign up link to a social media platform to the user. Upon user clicking the link, the AD-SURVEY may verify whether the user previously authorized 532 a/b AD-SURVEY to access their Facebook or Twitter information on their behalf and their previous authorization token (e.g., 522 in FIG. 5A) is not expired.
In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may receive user attempts to log in and determine whether the user is authorized 532 a/b to grant social media data access permission for AD-SURVEY. For example, when a user has received an email from a social media platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) comprising a AD-SURVEY link for authentication and the user clicks the link to proceed to grant permissions for AD-SURVEY, the user may deemed authorized to configure social media permissions via AD-SURVEY. In another implementation, when AD-SURVEY determines the user is not authorized, AD-SURVEY may redirect the user to a social media page 533 a/b with a AD-SURVEY application ID and a permission attribute request, e.g., as discussed at 515 in FIG. 5A.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether access is approved by the user, e.g., the user may select âYesâ or âCancelâ to indicate permission decision for AD-SURVEY to access the user's social media content when the social media platform sent an email notification indicating the access request from AD-SURVEY, e.g., at 515 in FIG. 5A.
For example, if the previous authorization is not valid or if it is a first time access then the AD-SURVEY application may use oAuth protocol to request Facebook or Twitter to provide access to user profile and messages (e.g., sending an access request 505 as shown in FIG. 5A). In such cases, the user may be redirected to Facebook or Twitter web site with request to log in and provide access parameters, e.g., see 515 in FIG. 5A, and 827 in FIG. 8C. Facebook or Twitter web site may present a login and permission screen with option to allow or deny requested access to AD-SURVEY (e.g., see 810 at FIG. 8A).
In one implementation, if the user approves the access request then in the response Facebook or Twitter may provide an authentication token associated with permission to the data elements (e.g., 518 at FIG. 5A). In one implementation, the authentication tokens may be requested with constant permission to allow user data access even when the user is neither logged into AD-SURVEY user portal (e.g., the mobile app 511 a or the web based app 511 b) nor any social media platform. In alternative implementations, the authentication token may request timely update and re-authentication from user on a periodic basis, e.g., weekly, monthly, etc. In further implementations, the user may revoke access of AD-SURVEY from to their social media account if they wish to opt out.
If the user granted the permission, AD-SURVEY may save the authorization response token provided by the social media platform in a user repository 535 a/b. The authentication token may be used in all subsequent requests to social networking sites to access user's data elements. In another implementation, if the user did not grant permission, the user may continue with the mobile application or the web based panel management website 536 a/b.  
Upon establishing and/or confirm user authorization for social media access, AD-SURVEY server may generate social messages to populate to social media platforms via AD-SURVEY 537, e.g., see 275 b in FIG. 2A, 365 b in FIG. 3A, etc.
 FIG. 5D provides a logic flow diagram illustrating data download from social media within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. Continuing on with 9 at FIG. 5A, AD-SURVEY may receive data updates from the social media servers 540. The AD-SURVEY may determine a source of the social media data 543, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and/or the like, and apply data format analytics rules based on the determined data source 545.
For example, if the data record is obtained from Facebook, the data format analytics may determine whether it is structured user profile information, a user posted photo, unstructured user posting on the wall, others' comments, and/or the like. For another example, if the data record is obtained from Twitter, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether it comprises raw text of a Tweet, and/or the like.
In one implementation, if the received data is structured 538, AD-SURVEY may parsing the structured data to extract information 552. For example, a structured user profile data record may be parsed per data field, e.g., user_id, user_name, user_DOB, user_interests, and/or the like. The AD-SURVEY may generate a data record including user ID/timestamp/geo source, etc. 555 and store the data record for the structured data 557 at a database (e.g., see 575 a in FIG. 5B).
In another implementation, if the received data is unstructured 538, e.g., raw texts of Facebook comments, Tweets, etc., AD-SURVEY may feed the data to a Taxonomy engine for data tagging 560, as further illustrated in FIGS. 6A-6C.
 FIGS. 5E-5F provide example data structures of social media data updates within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. For example, the data segments in FIGS. 5E-5F show database structure of social data elements associated with a user, wherein various data fields may be linked by a user ID, e.g., âUSER_TBL_ID.â
Within implementations, a AD-SURVEY analytics platform (e.g., 570 at FIG. 5C) may extract and use different sets of data elements from a user social media profile. For example, in one implementation, as shown in FIG. 5E-5F, a data record of a Facebook user profile may comprise data fields such as user work information, user education information, television viewing history, interested music, interested books, data feeds, likes, status message, comments on status message, wall posted comments, check-in history, and/or the like.
In one implementation, data elements are categorized based upon how frequently they are updated and AD-SURVEY may accordingly determine the fetch and refresh schedules. For example, the categorization may comprise users static descriptors, such as user demographic attributes like date of birth, gender, etc., which may be relatively âconstantâ and âstatic, and thus may be determined to scheduled to update every 6 months. For another example, the categorization may comprise dynamic descriptors, such as number of friends, Likes, television viewing, books and other preferences, which may be updated by a Facebook user more frequently, and may be scheduled for updates monthly. For another example, the categorization may comprise text messages, status, comment, messages, posts, etc., and may be scheduled to update daily and/or on demand. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may specify the requested content in a data request accordingly, e.g., for user descriptors only, for dynamic descriptor only, for text messages only, and/or any combination of the above. (e.g., see the âRequestedContentâ field in the example Facebook data request 522 in FIG. 5A).
 FIG. 6A provides a logic flow diagram illustrating social media analytics within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, a user may submit a request for media analytics 605, e.g., for a brand name product, a TV program, and/or the like. For example, a TV production company may desire to know audience comments about their TV program (e.g., see FIG. 1D). The AD-SURVEY server 220, upon receiving the user request, may generate a media analytics management panel user interface screen including a list of analytics options (e.g., see FIG. 8C) 610, and the user may submit media analytics parameters 613. For example, as shown in FIG. 8D, the AD-SURVEY management panel may allow a user to select social media source (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and/or the like), a time range, feedback activity type, and/or the like.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY server 220 may download social media data updates (e.g., as discussed in FIGS. 5A-5C), and form a query based on the retrieved social media data 615 based on the user inquiry. For example, when the producer CBS would like to know audience feedbacks of the show âThe Big Bang Theoryâ (e.g., see FIG. 1D), AD-SURVEY may search for data related to âThe Big Bang Theoryâ on the retrieved updated social media data.
For example, in one implementation, AD-SURVEY may form a query on the structured data based on key word âThe Big Bang Theoryâ and/or any character names and/or actors/actress names for the associated profiles, e.g., a Facebook pages, Twitter profiles, and obtain a number of followers from the structured data. In another example, AD-SURVEY may form a query based on the key term âThe Big Bang Theoryâ and obtain raw text comments containing the key term. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may perform a progressive search over the raw text (e.g., unstructured data, etc.). For example, AD-SURVEY may search for âThe Big Bang Theory,â and then refine the search results by âThe Big Bang Theory AND CBS,â and refine the search results by âThe Big Bang Theory AND CBS AND Show,â and/or the like. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may search the unstructured data based on data tags associated therewith, as further discussed in FIGS. 6B-6C.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may obtain query results 620, which may comprise a number of followers on the social media platform, a series of raw text comments from the social media, and/or the like. The AD-SURVEY may then determine a presentation format 623 to provide the results to the user. For example, when the user elects to choose âraw textsâ (e.g., see 850 in FIG. 8D), the user may view a list of raw text comments 630 (e.g. see 850 a/b in FIG. 8D). In another implementation, AD-SURVEY may select an output visualization format and present the visualization of query results to the user 625, and the user may view visualized results (e.g., see 860 a-c in FIG. 8E).
 FIGS. 6B-6C provide logic flow diagrams illustrating example taxonomy tagging logics within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, as discussed in FIG. 5C, unstructured data (e.g., raw texts of Facebook comments, Tweets, and/or the like) may be parsed and tagged with category tags by a taxonomy engine (e.g., see 583 b-383 c in FIG. 5C).
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may apply taxonomy model logics, which may comprise any of a first logical section associated with the semantic categorization of keywords and a second logical section associated with the sentiment keywords. In one implementation, the taxonomy may assign weighted scores to the logical tagging in conjunction with the semantic text.
For example, in one implementation, the semantic categorization logic may be hierarchical and specific to a domain to maintain simplicity of in model management and run time executions, e.g. a specific taxonomy model for TV shows, a specific taxonomy model for advertisement and brand mentions, a taxonomy model for any combination of the above, and/or the like.
 FIG. 6B shows an example TV shows semantic categorization model within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, unstructured data related to TV shows will be tagged with âTV showsâ 640 as a level 0 tag, and progressively be tagged with level 1, 2, 5, etc based on genre 641, show names 642, show network 643 a, show episodes 643 b, show cast member name 643 c, show character names 643 d, show episode names 643 e, other keyword texts in the descriptor 643 f and/or the like. For example, the example Tweet 185 in FIG. 1D, âThe Big Bang Theory is a good adaptation of the Southern Vampires series. Love the CBS actors/actresses. Expecting the new season,â may be tagged as âTV showâ->âSoapâ (genre)->âComedyâ (sub-genre)->âThe Big Bang Theoryâ (show name), âCBSâ (network), ânew seasonâ (episode), âgeeksâ (key words in descriptor), and/or the like.
 FIG. 6C shows an example advertisement brand awareness model within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, unstructured data related to an advertised and/or brand product may be tagged with âall categoriesâ 645 as a level 0 tag, and progressively be tagged with level 1, 2, 5, etc based product categories 646, product brand 647, ad content key words 648 a, brand name 648 b, brand name+ad content key words 648 c, product mentions 648 d, product name/type/model 648 e, key word text in descriptor 648 f, and/or the like. For example, in one implementation, a Facebook wall post âthe new Audi R8 commercial is so cool!â may be tagged as âConsumer Productsâ (all categories)->âAutomobilesâ (categories)->âAudiâ (brand)->âR8â (product model), âcommercialâ (ad content), âso coolâ (product mention/feedback), and/or the like.
 FIG. 6D provides an example logic flow diagram illustrating taxonomy tree definition within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, the taxonomy logic rules may be pre-defined by AD-SURVEY panel experts using structured data dictionaries. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may determine the âlow levelâ categories based on structured data dictionaries 650. For example, in one implementation, the TV show model may be designed based on a TV program guide to ensure the reporting label and naming is followed. In this way, the taxonomy may accelerate and automate the model development process.
The AD-SURVEY may extract sample text 653 for a TV show from social media by a text miner (e.g., the text analytics engine 583 c in FIG. 5C) to identify most commonly used key words by the social media users. For example, user comments posted on the Facebook page of âThe Big Bang Theoryâ (e.g., see 186 b in FIG. 1D) may be sampled to extract key words; if words such as âWerewolfâ (characters), âBontempâ (fictional town in the story), etc., are frequently used in the comments, the taxonomy engine may adopt these words for taxonomy tags, e.g., the key word text in descriptor (see 643 f in FIG. 6B). This process may enrich the dictionary and provide inputs to defining taxonomy rules. The AD-SURVEY may be associated with the identified key words with a level for the tagging 655. For example, in one implementation, the keywords identified from sampled social media raw texts (e.g., Tweets, Facebook posts, etc.) may be associated with appropriate nodes, e.g., level 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.
In a further implementation, AD-SURVEY may identify keywords set for each TV show/topic including words spelled differently but meant to refer the same entity 657 to expand the query scope, e.g. âCOCA-COLA,â âCOCA-COLA'S,â âCOKE,â âCOKE'S,â âCOCA COLA,â âCOCACOLA,â etc. Within implementations, a variety of logical combination of such key words may be coded as a logical rule 660 with AND, OR, Not operator, e.g.



 
 
 



 
 




 
â
Coke (Level 0)


 
 
[ coke + good] | [ coke + excellent] (Level 1)


 
 
[ coke + good] | [ coke + awesome] (Level 1)


 
 
[ coke in advert + too much taste to call zero] (Level2)


 
 
...


 
 





wherein the â+â is an AND operator and â|â is an OR operator. The AD-SURVEY may establish a taxonomy tree combining the rules and store the generated logic taxonomy tree in a taxonomy database (e.g., see 585 a in FIG. 5C).
 FIGS. 6E-6F provides an example logic flow illustrating taxonomy logic rule application within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, continuing on with 552 in FIG. 5C, e.g., upon receiving unstructured data for analytics and tagging, etc., AD-SURVEY may parse the unstructured data for a first level analytics, e.g., whether it is related to a TV show, and/or a brand product 680, and may generate a first tag associated with the unstructured data with a brand name 682 by querying on each brand in the brand database 684. The AD-SURVEY may then retrieve a taxonomy logic tree for the brand âCokeâ 686, as shown in the above example.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may follow the taxonomy tree for âCoke,â forming a query on a second category, e.g., brand name and positive mentions 690. In the above example, the taxonomy tree may apply a query on âCoke+Goodâ etc. If such text is found, AD-SURVEY may generate a sub tag associated with the unstructured data with âCoke+goodâ 693 a. If not, the AD-SURVEY may apply the taxonomy for an alternative query key terms, e.g., âCoke+Excellentâ 693 b, and/or the like. Similarly, if that is found, AD-SURVEY may generate a sub tag âCoke Excellentâ with the unstructured data 695.
Continuing on with FIG. 6F, the taxonomy engine may progressively query on âCokeâ and key word texts, e.g., âtoo much taste,â 696, etc. If such key words are found 697, the AD-SURVEY may generate s sub tag (e.g., level 2) with the unstructured data 698 a. If not, the AD-SURVEY may move on with the next taxonomy rule.
Within implementations, during the taxonomy rule execution process, each taxonomy rule may be executed at a leaf node and then the next higher level may be computed. Upon finishing with a taxonomy tree, the AD-SURVEY may generate a matching score of the applied taxonomy logics 699. For example, the score may be based on a similarity percentage of the key terms in each node of the taxonomy tree and the compared unstructured data segment. To maintain efficiency, taxonomy execution models may be logically partitioned. For example, for a segment of raw text, the same unstructured text segment may be executed through different models and scores generated may be merged and aggregated. When the similarity score is greater than a threshold (e.g., 80%, etc.) 6100, the current tagging generated from 682-698 a may be saved 6102. Otherwise, the AD-SURVEY may proceed with a different taxonomy model, e.g., at 686 in FIG. 6E.
In one implementations, AD-SURVEY may apply one or more taxonomy logics to an unstructured data segment, as the data segment (e.g., a Tweet, a Facebook post, etc.) may be related to one or more brand products, etc.
In further implementations, the taxonomy tagging mechanism may be associated with a weighting score at each ânodeâ of the taxonomy hierarchy. For example, in the above example for âCoke,â if the AD-SURVEY receives a client request to analyze consumer impression about a new product of Coca Cola on social media analytics, the AD-SURVEY may perform taxonomy mining upon unstructured data from the social media (e.g., consumer comments). Each ânodeâ may be progressively associated with a weight score to determine consumer impression. For example, when the data comprises âCoke,â a level 0 weight score may be assigned (e.g., 0.1, etc.); when the data comprises âCoke+goodâ or âCoke+excellent,â a level 1 weight score may be assigned (e.g., 0.5, etc.); but when the data comprises âCoke+horribleâ or âCokeâ with other negatively indicative adjectives, a negative level 1 weight score may be assigned (e.g., â0.5, etc.). In one implementation, the taxonomy engine may calculate an overall score of an unstructured data record when progressively querying upon taxonomy key terms, and generate statistical results of a group of unstructured data to determine the consumer impression. For example, the AD-SURVEY may generate statistical report as to how many consumers are positive, neutral, or negative towards âCoke,â based on their calculated scores, as illustrated in one example in FIGS. 6E-6F. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may generate popular brands, TV shows that are the mostly mentioned or positively commented from social media users, e.g., see FIG. 10H. In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may determine a social group to analyze their social content. For example, within the social group, the AD-SURVEY may determine user's influence over
over other members of the population, e.g., whether a user is an âinfluencer.â For example, when a user posts comments to the CBS show âThe Big Bang Theoryâ on Facebook, and his Facebook friends have âlikedâ his comments and subsequently watch the show, the user may be considered as a Facebook âinfluencer.â In one implementation, the notion of influencer may be specific to a social media platform; a person who is an influencer on one platform may not be an influencer on another.
In one implementation, the social influencer may be determined by social media indices. For example, the AD-SURVEY may analyze prerequisites for consideration as a social media influencer, such as whether a user has an account on a social web platform, whether the user has generated content on that platform within the past 30 days, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may calculate social media index of a user to determine an influencer. For each member that meets the prerequisites, a social media index is calculated using various measures. For example, the AD-SURVEY may calculate a reach measure, e.g., over the past 30 days, the maximum size of the network, which may be measured through âfriendsâ, âfollowersâ, or other similar measures. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may calculate a frequency measure, e.g., over the past 30 days, the total number of posts to the platform, which may be measured through things like âstatus updatesâ, âtweetsâ, or âcommentsâ, depending on the relevant content generation opportunities for the particular platform. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may calculate a resonance measure, e.g., over the past 30 days, the total number of responses to the individual's content. Depending on the platform, these responses may take the form of âretweetsâ, comments on âpostsâ or âstatus updatesâ, or direct messages responses to the individual. The responses may or may not need to come from individuals within the population being measured.
In one implementation, the calculated measures are then ranked against the same measure from other individuals in his or her demographic group. The demographic measures may include, but are not limited to, age, gender, race, education, and income. The specific groupings used for age, education, and income can vary based on the population being analyzed. An individual is considered an influencer if he or she ranks in the top 20% of at least two of the variables.
In further implementation, the influencer determination may be refined by product category. Each post made by an individual may be classified as mentioning a product, or not mentioning a product, based on text analysis against a standard taxonomy of products and brands. The volume of posts in each category can be tabulated, and an individual classified as an influencer in any product category which represents at least 20% of his or her product-classified posts. In further implementation, a social influencer may be specified and/or classified with regard to a TV show category, a category of products, a category of brands, and/or the like.
 FIG. 7A-7E provide exemplary data diagrams and logic flow diagrams illustrating cross-channel data collection and media measurement within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. FIG. 7A provides a block diagram illustrating AD-SURVEY data collection within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, the AD-SURVEY may adopt a variety of technologies including flash cookies, mobile applications, browser plug-ins, and/or the like, to capture media usage across different channels, e.g., TV, mobile, internet, social media, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may analyze the media usage data to study the advertisement effects of a brand product.
In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may track audience activities to content (planning and competitive analysis) and advertising (post analysis, ad effectiveness). In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may create digital footprints on usage as a bi-product of delivering content and advertising, e.g., via application session ID, cookie, etc., to create dataset that is used for tactical content and advertising decisions. For example, the MR-PLATFORM may set up a group of users (e.g., 100,000 users, etc.) to track their TV viewing, Mobile usage, Online surfing history, advertising exposure, demographic information, product ownership info for auto, location, financial services, product usage information for CPG/Pharma, and/or the like to provide survey research for ad effectiveness. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may recruit users with incentive rewards (e.g., the participants may be required to allow AD-SURVEY to access their social media content as illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5B), e.g., Credit in iTunes or Google App Store account (e.g., $10/quarter=$40 a year), local coupons/offers based on zip code, etc.
As shown in FIG. 7A, the AD-SURVEY may automatically collect data 705 from various source, e.g., online advertising usage 715, mobile device usage 720, TV viewing data 725, social media data (e.g., Facebook posts/conversations, etc.) 730 via API calls (e.g., see FIGS. 5A-5B). In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may employ panelists 710 to configure data downloads parameters, system maintenance, and/or the like. For example, the panelist may comprise social media users that allow AD-SURVEY to access their social profile and content for analytics.
 FIGS. 7B-7C provide example flow diagrams illustrating AD-SURVEY cross-channel data collection in alternative embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, a variety of data may be obtained and stored in a AD-SURVEY database (e.g., see 219 at FIG. 2A). In one implementation, as shown in FIG. 7B, AD-SURVEY may obtain data from different channel for cross-channel media measurement. For example, the AD-SURVEY may obtain TV channel changing (e.g., user submission of channel selection) 790 from a AD-SURVEY TV client application 795 a (e.g., see FIGS. 7A-7G), mobile advertising 791 a and mobile application 79 ab usage from a AD-SURVEY application 795 b, social media profile 778 a and social media comments 778 b from social media (e.g., Facebook Twitter, 750), user exposure to tagged advertisement 789 a from a client flash/HTTP cookies 789 b (e.g., see 375 in FIG. 3D), advertising exposure 790 a (e.g., whether a user clicks on an ad) and website visits 790 b from URL tracking of a user browser 797, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may incorporate the variety of data for a cross-channel study of user feedbacks of an advertisement, a brand, a product, a TV show, and/or the like.
In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may utilize the AD-SURVEY client component installed at a user mobile device to capture TV viewing in the home, survey responses, and/or the like. In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may adopt a mobile meter to measure mobile usage. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide a client component which may provide history information from a user's personal computer when user connects his mobile device to his computer to sync up so that the AD-SURVEY may track online Internet usage of the user, e.g., browsing history, clicks on ads, etc. In a further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may track TV ad exposure from a variety of meter data, e.g., TNS, M+, AceMetrix, and/or the like. In further implementations, data may be collected passively via mobile phones in almost real time, and/or when phone is being charged.
Within implementations, TV distribution may be driven by an over the air broadcast and a âone-to manyâ cable infrastructure. Unlike other media and industries, like the Internet and the CPG/retail environment, the TV infrastructure may not create footprints on usage with content (or product) distribution. In such cases, the industry may have a panel based research to understand the size and composition of TV audiences. All decisions related to programming, ad sales, and carriage deals between multiple system operator and cable networks may be based upon panel data, which may enable research providers to realize outsized rewards for providing insights.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY may obtain TV viewing data via Return Path Data (RPD) from Digital Set Top Boxes (RDTB), which may facilitate analysis of TV viewing to provide insights on viewing to small networks and small geographies, e.g., local market measurement reflecting a local TV station or cable MSO zone. For another example, metered data from RPD may be applied to analyze a group of categorized audience (e.g., heavy Coke drinkers) with targeted ad content (e.g., a 30 second commercial on a niche, targeted network).
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may study ad effects by collecting data with regard to user purchasing activities of the advertised products. For example, the AD-SURVEY may track user clicks on a âBuy it Nowâ button, e.g., see 750 c in FIG. 7G. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may obtain data form retailers, manufactures, Internet players, and/or the like, wherein real store data, frequent shopper cards usage, and log files (Internet shopping) may be analyzed to study placement decisions, increase traffic and sales (ad visits), use the granular traffic (click-stream) data to design customized products/content/advertising to shoppers/viewers, and real time analytics to better manage ad campaigns, and/or the like. In one implementation, a weighing scoring mechanism similar to that illustrated in FIG. 2I may be employed, but expanded to a variety of cross channel tracking data, to analyze ad effects within a cross channel dataset.
In further implementations, the MR-PLATFORM may access to non-live media, such as, Charter, TiVo, Rentrak, Internet TV (e.g., Google TV, Apple TV, and/or the like, and incorporate viewing data for analysis (e.g., see FIG. 2H).
In further implementation, Internet measurement data (e.g., from ISP data, etc.) may be collected, e.g., HTTP cookies, click-stream data with demographic information, and/or the like.
In further implementations, mobile usage may be tracked via specific applications (e.g., in a similar manner to log file analysis), anonymous location based tracking of cell users, and/or the like.
 FIG. 7C shows data collection via a proxy server within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. For example, in one implementation, a AD-SURVEY client application 795 b operated on a user device may collect and send information such as social application usage, GPS location, response to surveys, etc., to a database 719. In further implementations, social application usage and mobile advertising data may be passed to a AD-SURVEY proxy server 788 (e.g., see FIG. 7E), and/or a VPN server, which may forward it to the database 719. In one implementation, TV viewing data may be provided to the database 719 via a TV remote application 795 a (and/or a TV measurement network). In another implementation, social media engagement data (e.g., user posts, comments on the social media) 750 may be sent to the database as well. In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may obtain mobile search behavior of a user, exposure to social media (e.g., user viewing friends' recommendations on social media, etc.), and/or the like.
 FIG. 7D provides a data flow diagram illustrating AD-SURVEY data flow between entities within alternative embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, a AD-SURVEY database 719 may obtain data from Facebook server 782 a and Twitter server 782 b via API calls (e.g., see FIGS. 5A-5C). In further implementations, the access may be validated and/or authorized by AD-SURVEY panelists. In further implementations, other media exposure 782 e (e.g., see FIG. 7B-9C), survey data 782 f (e.g., from synchronized questionnaire, or other questionnaires handled by panelists, etc.), purchasing data 782 c, may be provided to the database. In a further implementation, the cross-channel data may be stored with a cloud storage 782 d.  
In one implementation, a client (e.g., a user, a merchant for analytics report, etc.) may access the AD-SURVEY analytics server 755 via a website 784, which may in turn operate with a text analytics platform 783 c to analyze social content, cross-channel data, and/or the like.
 FIG. 7E shows a logic flow diagram illustrating monitoring user device data transmission across different channels within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. Within embodiments, the AD-SURVEY may instantiate a proxy server to monitor data in/out of the user mobile device 740, wherein the data may be transmitted to/from different channels. In one implementation, the proxy server may receive data 742, and extract information from the received data 745 to determine a data type and monitor the user device activities which may indicate advertisement delivery/usage information. For example, if the data comprises a website URL 746, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the URL comprises an advertisement component 748. If yes, the AD-SURVEY may determine characteristics of the advertisement 749, e.g., classification of the advertisement (e.g., media genre, media source, content description, etc.). In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the advertisement running on the URL is an automatic advertisement, or requires user's manual trigger (e.g., user clicks for display). The AD-SURVEY may obtain identifying information, e.g., an Ad ID, 755, to generate prompt questions, e.g., at 312 in FIG. 3B.
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may identify an advertisement comprised in a URL link via advertisement image recognition. For example, the AD-SURVEY may identify graphical contents contained in a URL link based on empirical pattern of web content format. Such empirical patterns may be classified per URL link type (e.g., a shopping site link such as Amazon.com may have an advertisement placed at the center frame of the web page; a news link such as New York Times page may have an advertisement placed at the side/bottom bar of the web page, and/or the like). For another example, the AD-SURVEY may identify dynamic contents on the web page, such as, but not limited to flash contents, banners, applets, and/or the like, as displayed advertisements.
Within implementations, upon obtaining an image capture of an advertisement, the AD-SURVEY may adopt software packages to identify contents of the advertisement (e.g., a featured product name, a brand name, etc.) so that it can be associated with a user's ad exposure. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate a unique identifier indicative of visual characteristics of the captured ad graphical contents (e.g., a matrix representation of sampling of the captured ad image, etc.), and form a query on an ad database based on the unique identifier. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may adopt software packages similar to, but not limited to Google image search, and/or the like. Further details of advertisement image match may be similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,139, entitled âImage Based Search Engine for Mobile Phone with Camera,â which is herein expressly incorporated by reference.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may dissect an advertisement identification from the advertisement embedded in the web content (e.g., the URL link) to determine a product name, a brand name, and/or the like, which the user has been exposed to. In further implementations, the captured graphical advertisement contents may be tagged with metadata in compliance with formats associated with an advertisement, e.g., exif data tags (which may include unique advertising identifiers in the software tags, in the inter-operability tags, in the extension name/ID, extension description tags, and/or the like). Other graphical metadata formats may also be contemplated such as XMP, GIF, IPTC information interchange model metadata format, and/or the like.
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may determine whether a user clicked a URL link comprising media program content, e.g., a Youtube link, etc. The AD-SURVEY may extract an identifier, e.g., a web ID, etc., to determine the name of the media program. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may obtain excerpts of the media program, and determine a name of the media program via an embedded digital signature. In further implementation, the AD-SURVEY may set time stamp on the user's click on the URL link comprising a media program to record how long the user has been exposed to the media program. Further implementations of the ad identification are discussed in FIG. 7F.
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may track a user's browsing history by monitoring a stream of âclicksâ the user has submitted on his mobile device. For example, the AD-SURVEY may monitor user's âclicksâ to determine a type of the click, e.g., usage of media playing, visits of a different URL link, posting of social media contents, usage of an application, and/or the like. Using an app. The AD-SURVEY may then determine advertisement exposure associated with each âclickâ (e.g., via ad image identification illustrated in FIG. 7F).
In another implementation, the received data may comprise application information from the user device 751. The proxy server may ascertain an application inventory list of the user device 753, and/or application group sharing information 754. For example, one or more users who are Facebook friends, may form a group to share their interested TV watch list and viewing status via AD-SURVEY, and such information may be captured by the proxy server.
In another implementation, the received data may comprise indication of media usage 762, e.g., channel selection, atmospherics data, etc., the AD-SURVEY may determine whether the TV program on the selected channel has been listened, watched, and/or streamed 766. The AD-SURVEY may determine a title of the media program 767, and retrieve ad tags embedded in the media program from a media table to determine user ad exposure information, e.g., as discussed in FIGS. 3B-3C. In further implementations, the received data may comprise survey responses/social messages sent 763 to the AD-SURVEY, as further discussed in FIGS. 5A-5E.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate media analytics report 768 based on the obtained media data, including information as to user impressions to a brand name product, TV shows, etc., e.g., as shown in FIGURES ioA-10H.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide advertisers solutions to design advertising campaigns as to which type of media to place an ad, developing media plans with the optimal mix across media, determine the impact of advertising on brand awareness, favorability measures, intent to buy and actual purchase across media (ROI). In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide advertising measurement solutions using emerging sources of data, e.g., media consumption data (TV, online, mobile, social, etc.), shopper data for key categories, and/or the like.
In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide clients with insights on campaign effectiveness and recommendations on optimal media allocation using survey questionnaires (e.g., as further discussed in FIGS. 3A-3D) based on statistical modeling and regression analysis. In further implementations, the impact of each media may be separately analyzed to make recommendation on optimal spend and predict sales based upon survey responses.
In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may link different type of data for cross channel analysis. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may create a unified dataset that profiles audiences for TV and online media consumption, wherein each viewing source (e.g., individual TV set, household TV set, etc.) with viewing and ad exposure information for TV and online is associated with a unique identifier. For example, AD-SURVEY may adopt direct linkage by getting TV and online data for the same household (e.g., via ISP, cable provider, etc.). For another example, the AD-SURVEY may segment TV and online data, and link using segments (e.g., segmented by program category, zip code, air time, etc.). For another example, the AD-SURVEY may devise and distribute survey questions about TV viewing and linking with the respondents' online surfing data.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY may obtain media consumption data from a variety of channels, such as, but not limited to geographically dispersed TV viewing data sets (e.g., CANOE), persons tracking with EPGs or embedded in TV software or cell phones, metering data from STB, individual smartphone (e.g., Apple iPhone, etc.) based tracking (e.g., social content, persons' watching activities, etc.), and/or the like.
 FIG. 7F provides a block diagram illustrating example infrastructure of advertisement recognition within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. Within implementations, the AD-SURVEY may measure which advertisement audience has been exposed to by mining the monitored data in/out of the user mobile device, user computer, and/or the like (see e.g., 740 at FIG. 7E). For example, URL links and data file may be collected and sent 772 by a data collection software 771 running at a client component instantiated on a user mobile device. In another implementation, the data collection may be performed at a proxy or VPN server.
For digital advertising (online and mobile), AD-SURVEY may classify the advertisements via a hybrid manual/automatic process. For example, AD-SURVEY may adopt a mobile or PC-based system (using a software meter, VPN, and/or Proxy Server, among other technologies) to pass along to a staging server the URL of the ad, along with the actual file (typically a .gif, .jpg, or .png). For example, upon receiving ad data including URLs and associated digital files (e.g., media program excerpt files, etc.) via a network connection 773, the AD-SURVEY server 774 may compare the received advertisement data with ad profiles in a database 775. The filename, file size, and other data may be compared against an ad database, and if the ad has already been classified, then the new ad exposure event is transmitted to a classification engine 776 classified based on classification rules in the database. Classification rules may include brand and product mentions, as well as ad size and other descriptors. If a match is not found, then the ad is put in a queue for manual classification by a AD-SURVEY representative. For example, the AD-SURVEY representative may identify the object (e.g., a product, a brand name, etc.) that is advertised within the ad.
In one implementation, the advertisement may be identified via graphical content match, as discussed in FIG. 7E. In an alternative implementation, the ad identification may be performed via an automated system, by which ads that do not match any items in the ad database may be examined automatically by a computer program for clues as to the proper classification. For example, when an ad that mentions Acura in the ad image, the AD-SURVEY may automatically classify the ad as an Acura advertisement. Within implementations, the AD-SURVEY may perform character recognition procedures (e.g., optical character recognition, etc.) to obtain key terms from advertisement images for advertising exposure identification. Such ad identification may be used for advertising effectiveness measurement. Numerous OCR engines may be adopted, such as GOCR, Java OCR, OmniPage, SimpleOCR, and/or the like.
 FIGS. 8A-8E provide exemplary mobile screen shots illustrating user interfaces within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. As shown in FIG. 8A, the AD-SURVEY user interface may comprise a section for social media status, e.g., the Facebook user âJohn Smith is watching The Big Bang Theory on CBSâ 820. The user may also view a list of his friends' status 805, e.g., what the friends are watching.
In one implementation, the user may view a list of channel program 810 schedules, and may elect to tap on the screen to choose one of the listed channels. In a further implementation, the user may select to allow ambient monitoring 850, so that the AD-SURVEY may âlisten-inâ and submit atmospherics data to the AD-SURVEY server, as discussed at 241 in FIG. 2B.
In further implementations, the user may click on the âPromptsâ 820 button and view a drop down list of survey questions, e.g., as shown in FIG. 8B. The survey question may be generated based on the media content the user has been watching, as discussed in FIG. 3B. Upon the user submitting a response, as shown in FIG. 8C, the user response may be populated as a social media message 830. In one implementation, the user's friends may view the user's activity and âlikesâ the user's response 831 a, commented on the response 831 b, and/or follow the link of the survey and participate in the survey 831 c.  
In further implementations, as shown in FIG. 8D, the user may tap on the âSocialâ 815 button and launch a drop down panel for social media inputs 815 a. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may generate an automatic message template for the user based on the media ad tags, e.g., the user likes an embedded product placement 815 b. For another example, the user may manually type texts to update his social media status 815 c.  
In further implementations, as shown in FIG. 8E, if the user elects to submit a message on social media indicating he likes the embedded product placement 835, the user's friends may be aware of the product. For example, the user's friends may like the post 835 a, comment on the product 835 b. For another example, the AD-SURVEY may feed a link directing to a merchant site comprising the placed product along with the social media message, and the user's friend may follow the link to learn more about the placed product via the social media 835 c.  
 FIGS. 8F-8G provide example mobile screens illustrating synchronized ads within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, AD-SURVEY may provide a static (e.g., textual) ad 820 b in a prompts drop-down menu 820, as shown in FIG. 8F. For example, when the user selected channel âCBSâ has âThe Big Bang Theoryâ on air, and the media content arrives at a timestamp wherein a pair of âwhite framed sunglassesâ is tagged in the scene, AD-SURVEY may generate a pop-up ad 820 b and provide a link for a user to tap on to check out for more details.
 FIG. 8G shows an example interactive ad. For example, the AD-SURVEY may generate an interactive ad including a screen shot of the TV program containing the placed products. The featured products may be tagged (e.g., highlighted by white-line boxes) in the screen image, e.g., a pair of âXYZ-designer French style sunglassesâ 850 a, and âDDD Red Polka Dots Bikini Halter Topâ 850 b. A user may tap on a âBuy it Nowâ label 850 c to check out more details, and/or be directed to a merchant site to transact a sale.
In a further implementation, the interactive ad may comprise a user rating of the featured product showing beneath the product. In one implementation, the user rating may be obtained from historical user rating data, social media rating, and/or the like. In one implementation, the user may enter his own rating by tapping on the box 850 d.  
In a further implementation, the user may browse the interactive ads (e.g., including screen shots from the TV program comprising product placement tags, etc.) by going to a previous page 851, and/or a next page 852. In further implementations, the user may elect to browse interactive ads associated with the TV program in a variety ways. For example, the user may elect to view a list of all ads 855 a; may elect to view by season episode 855 b; may elect to view by character 855 c (e.g., products carried by, or associated with the character names in the show); may elect to view by item category 855 d (e.g., apparel, accessories, furniture, hair products, etc.), and/or the like. In further implementations, the user may initiate a search on desired products 858. For example, if the user is interested in a red hat the character âPennyâ wore in one of the scenes, the user may form a query on the embedded ads table based on key terms âPenny,â âred,â âhat,â etc.
 FIGS. 8H-8L provide example mobile screen shots illustrating a AD-SURVEY TV remote client component within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, as shown in FIG. 8H, a user may receive TV guide (e.g., 863) as a list of channel program information 860. The user may also receive live TV information updates in a pop-up window 861 at a âliveâ section 862. The user may further configure parameters in a âRemotesâ section 864 and âSettingsâ 865, as further illustrated in FIGS. 8J-8L.
When the user tap on the âliveâ section 862, the user may view a list of most viewed programs, e.g., ranked by registered AD-SURVEY users. The user may also see a list of program that the user's social friends are watching 868, and a list of programs the user has selected 866.
 FIG. 8I provides example screens illustrating the âRemotesâ 864 at FIG. 8H within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. For example, upon plugging an infrared accessory (e.g., see 120 in FIG. 1B) to a user mobile device, the user may turn the mobile device (e.g., an Apple iPhone, iPod, iTouch, iPad, BlackBerry, Google Android, Palm, etc.) into an infrared TV remote control. Upon tapping on âremoteâ 864, the user may view a virtual TV remote panel which comprises control buttons for TV program information 870 from which the user may tap to select channels, adjust volume levels, etc. The AD-SURVEY may provide a set-top box control panel to the user for the user to control live/on-demand video playing, and/or the like. The user may also configure DVR control 870 a, live TV 870 b, on demand TV 870 c, TiVo 870 d, TV guide 870 d and intelligent TV (e.g., Apple TV 871, Google TV 872), and/or the like. For another example, the user may view an array of fast keys for different channels 873.
 FIGS. 8J-8K provides example screens illustrating the âSettingâ 865 at FIG. 8H within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, the user may configure TV provider 875 a, set-top box 875 b, Smart TV 875 c, TiVo 875 d, DVD 875 e parameters for the mobile TV remote for AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, the user may enter the zip code 876 to receive a list of TV providers available in the area, and select his own provider. In another implementation, the user may elect to choose âuse TVâ only, or to set-up and test a set-top box for his television set. In further implementations, the user may configure TV and DVD parameters so that the infrared plug-in accessory may query an address of the TV and DVD set. In one implementation, the user may select a TV brand 880 from a brand list, and then select a type of the TV. For example, the user may tap on a few testing buttons under each type, e.g., âPower,â âVolume,â âSelect,â etc., to test whether the remote control works for the TV.
In another implementation, the user may configure DVDs via the AD-SURVEY. The AD-SURVEY may initiate an automatic scan upon user selection, and/or receive an indication from the user of the DVD brand. Upon indicating the DVD brand, the user may test connection with the DVD set to select a DVD type.
In another implementation, the user may enter a zip code to configure the TV provider 875 a, so that the AD-SURVEY may provide a list of TV providers for the user to choose.
 FIG. 8K provides an exemplary mobile screen shot illustrating social profile of a TV program within implementations of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, the user may select a TV program (e.g., âChannel 5â 885) on a channel to view its social profile. In one implementation, the user may tap on âCheck-inâ 886 to populate a Facebook message with regard to the checked TV program, and/or âTwitterâ icon 887 to share such information on Twitter. For example, to âCheck-in,â the user may select post onto his Facebook wall by typing a message 886 a, and/or share the automatically generated message 886 a by AD-SURVEY. In another implementation, if the user chooses to âTweet,â the user may view a list of âdiscussionâ 888 Tweets with regard to the show âThe Big Bang Theory,â and may generate his own Tweet.
In one implementation, the user may view a social rating 889 of the TV program âThe Big Bang Theoryâ under its profile. For example, the rating 889 may be given by social users of AD-SURVEY who has viewed the program, and the user may elects to submit his own rating 889 a. In a further implementation, the user may obtain a list of âsocial watchingâ 890 to see a list of social users (e.g., social media users who has allowed AD-SURVEY to access their social profiles, etc.) who is watching the selected TV program.
 FIG. 9A provides an exemplary mobile screen shot (e.g., 511 a in FIGS. 5A-5B) illustrating user authorization of AD-SURVEY access to the user's Facebook content within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, a user may receive a message (e.g., a pop-up message window, an email, etc.) requesting a user to elect whether to allow AD-SURVEY to access his Facebook content. For example, the user may tap on a link in the message, e.g., âYesâ or âNot Nowâ to grant or deny permission to his Facebook content.
In another implementation, as shown in FIG. 9A, a user may configure social network connection settings under the settings (e.g., see 865 at FIG. 8H) of AD-SURVEY client mobile application. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may send an access request so that a user may view a prompt from his mobile device 911, and may elect allow or disallow the AD-SURVEY access attempt 902. The user may be directed to a Facebook login page 910, wherein Facebook may request user to provide login credentials to verify the permission authorization. For example, the user may enter his email address 913 and password 915 to login to Facebook. For another example, if the user does not have a Facebook account yet, upon tapping on âYes,â the user may be directed to create a new account. In another implementation, if the user's mobile application (e.g., an iPhone Facebook app, a mobile browser, etc.) stores user previously entered login credentials, the user mobile device may send the login credentials to the social media to proceed with access authorization, so that the user may not need to view the login page 910 to manually provide user credentials.
Upon providing Facebook login credentials and verification of Facebook, the user may receive a request for permission screen 911 to select to âAllowâ 908 AD-SURVEY to access the user's Facebook profile. In further implementations, the user may configure access parameters in a similar manner as illustrated in FIGS. 9B-8C.
 FIGS. 9B-8C provide exemplary web-based user interface (e.g., 511 b in FIGS. 5A-5B) illustrating user authorization of AD-SURVEY access to the user's social media content within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. For example, in one implementation, a user may access a web-based AD-SURVEY configuration page via an Internet browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.) to bridge his social media accounts with AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, the user may select a list of social media platforms 920 to join AD-SURVEY, e.g., the user may click on checkboxes to choose Facebook 921 a, Twitter 921 b, Google+921 c, Tumblr 921 d and/or the like. In further implementations, the user may specify other social media platforms not listed by AD-SURVEY by typing a URL address, e.g., âFourSquare,â etc. Upon selecting the social media, the user may click âSend Requestâ 925 so that AD-SURVEY may send a connection request to the selected social media platforms, e.g., Facebook 921 a and Twitter 921 b as shown in the example of FIG. 9B. In another implementation, the user may click âCancelâ 926 to abort the access control configuration.
In one implementation, upon submitting the request 925, the social media platform may request login confirmation 925. For example, the user may be redirected to the social media homepage to login. For another example, the user may be presented a pop-up window 928 for the social analytics to connect with Facebook, e.g., the user may need to provide email 926 and password 927 to login to Facebook.
As shown in FIG. 9C, upon providing user Facebook credentials, the user may configure access scope 927 for Facebook content. For example, the user may elect to allow AD-SURVEY to access his user profile, e.g., the user may select among a list of checkboxes for user name, user address, user email, user phone number, work information, education information, date of birth, pages, groups, networks, and/or the like. For another example, the user may configure the AD-SURVEY may access his friends information 929, e.g., the user may allow the AD-SURVEY to obtain a number 0 friends 929 a but may not allow the AD-SURVEY to access details of the friends list. For another example, the user may allow the AD-SURVEY to access his wall posts 930, e.g., the user may allow the AD-SURVEY to access his post on his own wall 930 a (including sharing links, posted photos, status update, messages, etc.). The user may conditionally allow AD-SURVEY to access his post on his friend's wall when the friend allows access to his wall 930 c. Similarly, the user may conditionally allow AD-SURVEY to access the user's likes/dislikes when the liked or disliked item owner allows AD-SURVEY access 930 d as well.
 FIGS. 9D-9F provide exemplary web-based user interface illustrating media analytics within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. For example, as shown in FIG. 9D, a AD-SURVEY user/client (e.g., an advertising merchant, a TV media producer, etc.) who may desire to know audience feedbacks to an ad, TV program, and/or the like, may access a media analytics reports 940 module. In one implementation, the user may select tabs for different options to view analytics of a targeted object (e.g., a TV show, an advertisement, etc.). For example, a use may elect to view comments categorized by people 941, TV shows 942, brand names 943, products 944, media sources 944, and/or the like.
In one implementation, as shown in FIG. 9D, if the user selects TV shows 942, the user may provide information of the TV show by selecting a TV network, (e.g., âCBSâ at 945 a), genre (e.g., âComedyâ at 945 b), show name (e.g., âThe Big Bang Theoryâ at 945 c), from a drop down list. In another implementation, the user may manually enter a name of the TV show 945 d to query on a TV show database at AD-SURVEY.
In one implementation, the user may configure analytics parameters such as social content source 948 (e.g., check on âFacebookâ and âTwitterâ), time range 949 (e.g., between a specified time and present). The user may further select a presentation format, e.g., whether to view raw textual comments 950, or a visualized summary 955 (e.g., plain format 955 a, chart/plots 955 b, or table 955 c). For example, if raw text 950 is selected, the user may view a list of Facebook comments 950 a, and Tweets 950 b related to the show âThe Big Bang Theory.â
In another implementation, as shown in FIG. 9E, if the user elects to view analytics report in a visualized format 955, the summary may be presented in a plain textual format, e.g., 960 a, showing statistical results of the positive, neutral and/or negative comments. For another example, charts/plots 960 b, and a table 960 c summary may be presented. In one implementation, the analytics summary may be broken down to different categories, e.g., the comments for each category âCBS,â âThe Big Bang Theory,â âCharacters,â âMusicâ of the show, and/or the like.
 FIGS. 10A-10H provides exemplary user interfaces of media analytics reports within embodiments of the AD-SURVEY. FIG. 10 A provides an exemplary AD-SURVEY media analytics UI flow. Within implementations, upon obtaining measurement data from a variety of data channels (e.g., social media, URL links, mobile metering, etc.), the AD-SURVEY may provide web based media analytics platform for a user to access via a Internet web browser. The recorded data analytics as shown in FIGS. 10A-10F may be explored via a variety of data file formats including XML, ASC, and/or the like, through the database export mechanism. Within implementations, these exported files may be imported to analytical tools, such as SAS, etc., wherein various statistical analysis may be engaged. In one implementation, selections made from the dashboard, e.g., a genre selection, 1041 of FIG. 10H, may be used as the query filter prior to the export of the physical information, and as such, and data imported into the package will be limited to the selector (e.g., genre, name, etc.). The output from a standard statistical output from package SAS may be used in its entirety and/or parsed for the dashboard report. For example, the AD-SURVEY may download the statistical output in a text format and present it in a dashboard user interface. In another example, the SAS output may be reported in a statistical format (e.g., comma delineated XML file), which may enhance parsing for the dashboard report generation.
For example, the AD-SURVEY may provide a welcome/login screen to a user 1005, wherein the user may be a AD-SURVEY client, such as a TV producer, an advertiser, a merchant, and/or the like, who may be interested to learn their TV audience statistics, brand/products impressions, and/or the like.
Upon user login at 1005, the AD-SURVEY may provide a customized dashboard page 1008, e.g., as further illustrated in one implementation at FIGS. 10B/10H. The dashboard page may provide an overview of the media analytics results, such as generated report types 1010, available statistics charts/plots, and/or the like. For example, the AD-SURVEY may perform analytics to generate advertising reports 1012 (e.g., advertisement delivery reports 1012 a, etc.), audience reports 1015 (e.g., an audience summary report 1015 a, audience reports by gender reach 1015 b, by age reach 1015 c, reports per day of week 1015 d, reports per hour during a day part 1015 e, etc.).
 FIG. 10B provides an exemplary screen shot for media analytics dashboard 1008. In one implementation, a user may elect to configure media analytics parameters. For example, the user may select an object of the media analytics, which may be a media platform, a TV channel, an application platform, and/or the like. The dashboard board may provide a dropdown menu to allow the user to select various applications and media platforms e.g., the user may select view application usage of âFoursquareâ 1018. In other implementations, the user may select targeted AD-SURVEY social users for the study, e.g., by checking user gender 1020, age groups 1021, user interface types (e.g., AD-SURVEY application, mobile, web, etc.), phone types 1023, day part time range 1024, user location 1025, and/or the like. In further implementations, the user configured social user group may be saved as a group for further analysis.
In one implementation, the media analytics dashboard page may provide a plot of total AD-SURVEY user sessions 1028 based on the user configured AD-SURVEY social user group. For example, the personal trending data statistics 1028 may further comprise plots of number of users, number of sessions, number of new users, median/mean session length, geographic regions of users, and/or the like. In another implementation, AD-SURVEY may provide analysis of AD-SURVEY application usage statistics 1029, such as a total number of sessions, a total number of registered users, a median session length per user, and/or the like. In another implementation, the AD-SURVEY may provide a summary table 1030 showing the study of user selected reporting application âFoursquare,â including audience active reach, total visits, visits per person, total web page views, page view per person, duration, time per person, web user gender, age, and/or the like. For example, a report on the number of users may summarize the number of users an application (e.g., âFoursquareâ) has had over period of tracking to indicate whether the number is growing or declining. The report may also analyze user sessions in different scenarios (e.g., whether by a single user). For example, when a mobile site has been visited for 50 times, but 30 of those times it was from the same user, versus another month the number visits from different users was 25, the number of users may not be considered as increased.
For another example, a report on number of sessions may include number of sessions by all users within the last calendar month, which may be tracked on a monthly trending basis to indicate how often an application/site was seen by all users. For another example, a report on number of new users may show the number of new users for the last calendar month using the application or mobile site. For another example, the median/mean session length may indicate the time spent on application/site. For another example, the geo graphic region of users may show a geographical distribution of users engaging or visiting the application/advertisement
 FIG. 10C provides an exemplary audience summary report 1015 a. As shown in FIG. 10C, the user may select to view âsummaryâ 1030 a, for a data table showing: for each reporting application (e.g., Facebook, ESPN SportsCenter, etc.), statistics data for Unique Audience, Percent Active Reach, Time per person (minutes), TPP/Month, Number of visits, Number of pages viewed, Visits/person, Male/Female (for unique and non-unique users/visitors), Age groups (for unique and non-unique users/visitors). For example, the unique audience may be calculated as the total real number of users of an app/site without double counting users that have reused the site/app more than once in a month, and/or the like. The percent active reach of all smartphone users may be calculated as the percentage of users that checked a particular mobile website or application within the last calendar month, e.g., when there are 100 smartphone users, 88 checked Facebook within the last calendar month, active users equal 88%. The time per person (minutes) may be calculated as the amount of time spent during a day on a site/app by avg. active user, e.g., if there was 88 active users and they used a site/app for a total of 20 hours during the day, then the time per person is equal to 22.72 minutes (20/88=0.2272). The TPP/month may be calculated as the time per person per month that is spent on the site. e.g., if there are 70 users and in total and they spend 1000 hours on the site/app then the time per person per month would be 11.11 hours (1000/90). The number of visits may be calculated as the total number of times an app/site was visited during the last calendar month by all users. The number of pages viewed may be calculated as the total number pages viewed on an app/site during the last calendar month by all users. The visits/person may be calculated as the number of visits to app/site on a per active users basis. In one implementation, the above mentioned metrics may be assessed by male/female gender classification (for unique and non-unique users/visitors), age groups (for unique and non-unique users/visitors), e.g., age brackets may be 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+, etc.
 FIG. 10D provides an exemplary audience report per gender reach 1015 b. As shown in FIG. 10C, the user may select to view âGender Reachâ 1030 b, for a data table showing application report classified by gender, including unique audience active reach (%), total duration (in minutes), time per person, time per person for the month, total web page views, pages per person, total visits, visits per person, and/or the like. For example, the audience report by gender may include data for each app/site broken up by gender. For example, Facebook may provide male and female break of user base, about time men spend on the app, number of pages, etc.
 FIG. 10F provides an exemplary audience report per age reach 1015 c. As shown in FIG. 10C, the user may select to view âAge Reachâ 1030 c, for a data table showing application report classified by age, including total audience, unique audience, active reach (%), total duration (in minutes), time per person, time per person over a month period, total page views, pages per person, total visits, visits per person, and/or the like broken up in different age groups.
 FIG. 10G provides an exemplary audience report per day 1015 e. As shown in FIG. 10G, the user may select to view âDay Partâ 1030 e, for a data table showing application report classified by hours of a day. For example, for this report, for this report, data for each app/site may be broken up by the hour of the day. For example, as shown in FIG. 10G, the Youtube app usage data may be broken up by the hour of the day.
 FIG. 10 H provides an exemplary analytics report within an alternative implementation of the AD-SURVEY. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may collect social data from social media platforms of different social groups (e.g., 1066 a, 1066 b), e.g., the social groups determined by user configured parameters as shown in FIG. 10B, to determine a variety of measures of social TV watching status, such as, but not limited to profile measures 1051, liking measures 1052, brand measures 1053, TV shows watching measures 1054, and/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SURVEY may define a social group based on age ranges, gender, demographic information, geographical location, income level, educational level, and/or the like. In another implementation, the user may configure parameters for TV shows, brands/products, social groups, and/or the like, e.g., genre 1041, actors 1042, networks 1043, first run time 1044, airing time 1045, brand 1046, product type 1047, date 1048, geography 1049, influencer s 1050, age 1020, gender 1021, and/or the like.
For example, in one implementation, for a specified TV show (e.g., âBig Bang Theoryâ at âCBSâ), the profile measure 1051 may provide social data metrics with regard to social groups, such as percentage of influencers in a social group (e.g., social users whose watching recommendations have been followed by other social users, etc.), percentage of users who engage in watching the show, percentage of users who is distracted from watching the show (e.g., via atmospherics analysis as illustrated in FIG. 2E), number of friends who have engaged in the TV watching, number of posts per week, a number of brand pages the social group has followed, number of photos the social group has posted, and/or the like. In further implementations, the AD-SURVEY may analyze the social media content to provide liking measures 1052, such as the most positively commented 10 brand pages, music pages, TV show pages, and/or the like; brand measures 1053, such as the top 10 brands, top 5 products mentioned within a social group, and/or the like; the top TV shows watched 1054, and/or the like.
AD-SURVEY Controller
 FIG. 11 shows a block diagram illustrating embodiments of a AD-SURVEY controller. In this embodiment, the AD-SURVEY controller 1101 may serve to aggregate, process, store, search, serve, identify, instruct, generate, match, and/or facilitate interactions with a computer through social network and electronic commerce technologies, and/or other related data.
Typically, users, which may be people and/or other systems, may engage information technology systems (e.g., computers) to facilitate information processing. In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors 1103 may be referred to as central processing units (CPU). One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to carry and pass encoded (e.g., binary) signals acting as instructions to bring about various operations. These instructions may be operational and/or data instructions containing and/or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory 1129 (e.g., registers, cache memory, random access memory, etc.). Such communicative instructions may be stored and/or transmitted in batches (e.g., batches of instructions) as programs and/or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes, e.g., programs, may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and/or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY controller 1101 may be connected to and/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices 1111; peripheral devices 1112; an optional cryptographic processor device 1128; and/or a communications network 1113.
Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term âserverâ as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting âclients.â The term âclientâ as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user and/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a ânode.â Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a ârouter.â There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.
The AD-SURVEY controller 1101 may be based on computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization 1102 connected to memory 1129.
Computer Systemization
A computer systemization 1102 may comprise a clock 1130, central processing unit (âCPU(s)â and/or âprocessor(s)â (these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary)) 1103, a memory 1129 (e.g., a read only memory (ROM) 1106, a random access memory (RAM) 1105, etc.), and/or an interface bus 1107, and most frequently, although not necessarily, are all interconnected and/or communicating through a system bus 1104 on one or more (mother)board(s) 1102 having conductive and/or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions (e.g., binary encoded signals) may travel to effectuate communications, operations, storage, etc. The computer systemization may be connected to a power source 1186; e.g., optionally the power source may be internal. Optionally, a cryptographic processor 1126 and/or transceivers (e.g., ICs) 1174 may be connected to the system bus. In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and/or transceivers may be connected as either internal and/or external peripheral devices 1112 via the interface bus I/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) 1175, thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and/or sensor protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 50.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS) (thereby allowing AD-SURVEY controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329 FKUBG transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom BCM4750IUB8 receiver chip (e.g., GPS); an Infineon Technologies X-Gold 618-PMB9800 (e.g., providing 2G/3G HSDPA/HSUPA communications); and/or the like. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization's circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that may increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and/or the like. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.
The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves may incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and/or the like. Additionally, processors may include internal fast access addressable memory, and be capable of mapping and addressing memory 1129 beyond the processor itself; internal memory may include, but is not limited to: fast registers, various levels of cache memory (e.g., level 1, 2, 5, etc.), RAM, etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address, which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and/or XScale; and/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the AD-SURVEY controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed AD-SURVEY), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.
Depending on the particular implementation, features of the AD-SURVEY may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and/or the like. Also, to implement certain features of the AD-SURVEY, some feature implementations may rely on embedded components, such as: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (âASICâ), Digital Signal Processing (âDSPâ), Field Programmable Gate Array (âFPGAâ), and/or the like embedded technology. For example, any of the AD-SURVEY component collection (distributed or otherwise) and/or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and/or via embedded components; e.g., via ASIC, coprocessor, DSP, FPGA, and/or the like. Alternately, some implementations of the AD-SURVEY may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.
Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may include software solutions, hardware solutions, and/or some combination of both hardware/software solutions. For example, AD-SURVEY features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called âlogic blocksâ, and programmable interconnects, such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the AD-SURVEY features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the AD-SURVEY system designer/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the AD-SURVEY may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate AD-SURVEY controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the âCPUâ and/or âprocessorâ for the AD-SURVEY.
Power Source
The power source 1186 may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and/or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell 1186 is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the AD-SURVEY thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power source 1186 is connected to the system bus component 1104. In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source 1186 is provided through a connection across the I/O 1108 interface. For example, a USB and/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.
Interface Adapters
Interface bus(ses) 1107 may accept, connect, and/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as but not limited to: input output interfaces (I/O) 1108, storage interfaces 1109, network interfaces 1110, and/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces 1127 similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed, such as, but not limited to: Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), Card Bus, (Extended) Industry Standard Architecture ((E)ISA), Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), NuBus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (Extended) (PCI(X)), PCI Express, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), and/or the like.
Storage interfaces 1109 may accept, communicate, and/or connect to a number of storage devices such as, but not limited to: storage devices 1114, removable disc devices, and/or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: (Ultra) (Serial) Advanced Technology Attachment (Packet Interface) ((Ultra) (Serial) ATA(PI)), (Enhanced) Integrated Drive Electronics ((E)IDE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394, fiber channel, Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), Universal Serial Bus (USB), and/or the like.
Network interfaces 1110 may accept, communicate, and/or connect to a communications network 1113. Through a communications network 1113, the AD-SURVEY controller is accessible through remote clients 1133 b (e.g., computers with web browsers) by users 1133 a. Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: direct connect, Ethernet (thick, thin, twisted pair 10/100/1000 Base T, and/or the like), Token Ring, wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a-x, and/or the like. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and/or capacity, distributed network controllers (e.g., Distributed AD-SURVEY), architectures may similarly be employed to pool, load balance, and/or otherwise increase the communicative bandwidth required by the AD-SURVEY controller. A communications network may be any one and/or the combination of the following: a direct interconnection; the Internet; a Local Area Network (LAN); a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN); an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet (OMNI); a secured custom connection; a Wide Area Network (WAN); a wireless network (e.g., employing protocols such as, but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), I-mode, and/or the like); and/or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further, multiple network interfaces 1110 may be used to engage with various communications network types 1113. For example, multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast, multicast, and/or unicast networks.
Input Output interfaces (I/O) 1108 may accept, communicate, and/or connect to user input devices 1111, peripheral devices 1112, cryptographic processor devices 1128, and/or the like. I/O may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: audio: analog, digital, monaural, RCA, stereo, and/or the like; data: Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), IEEE 1394a-b, serial, universal serial bus (USB); infrared; joystick; keyboard; midi; optical; PC AT; PS/2; parallel; radio; video interface: Apple Desktop Connector (ADC), BNC, coaxial, component, composite, digital, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), RCA, RF antennae, S-Video, VGA, and/or the like; wireless transceivers: 802.11a/b/g/n/x; Bluetooth; cellular (e.g., code division multiple access (CDMA), high speed packet access (HSPA(+)), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), long term evolution (LTE), WiMax, etc.); and/or the like. One typical output device may include a video display, which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) based monitor with an interface (e.g., DVI circuitry and cable) that accepts signals from a video interface, may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Another output device is a TV set, which accepts signals from a video interface. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).
User input devices 1111 often are a type of peripheral device 512 (see below) and may include: card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, microphones, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, touch screens (e.g., capacitive, resistive, etc.), trackballs, trackpads, sensors (e.g., accelerometers, ambient light, GPS, gyroscopes, proximity, etc.), styluses, and/or the like.
Peripheral devices 1112 may be connected and/or communicate to I/O and/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, directly to the interface bus, system bus, the CPU, and/or the like. Peripheral devices may be external, internal and/or part of the AD-SURVEY controller. Peripheral devices may include: antenna, audio devices (e.g., line-in, line-out, microphone input, speakers, etc.), cameras (e.g., still, video, webcam, etc.), dongles (e.g., for copy protection, ensuring secure transactions with a digital signature, and/or the like), external processors (for added capabilities; e.g., crypto devices 528), force-feedback devices (e.g., vibrating motors), network interfaces, printers, scanners, storage devices, transceivers (e.g., cellular, GPS, etc.), video devices (e.g., goggles, monitors, etc.), video sources, visors, and/or the like. Peripheral devices often include types of input devices (e.g., cameras).
It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed, the AD-SURVEY controller may be embodied as an embedded, dedicated, and/or monitor-less (i.e., headless) device, wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.
Cryptographic units such as, but not limited to, microcontrollers, processors 1126, interfaces 1127, and/or devices 1128 may be attached, and/or communicate with the AD-SURVEY controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller, manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and/or within cryptographic units. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allowing for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of the CPU. Equivalent microcontrollers and/or processors may also be used. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include: Broadcom's CryptoNetX and other Security Processors; nCipher's nShield; SafeNet's Luna PCI (e.g., 7100) series; Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184; Sun's Cryptographic Accelerators (e.g., Accelerator 6000 PCIe Board, Accelerator 500 Daughtercard); Via Nano Processor (e.g., L2100, L2200, U2400) line, which is capable of performing 500+ MB/s of cryptographic instructions; VLSI Technology's 53 MHz 6868; and/or the like.
Memory
Generally, any mechanization and/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory 1129. However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the AD-SURVEY controller and/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory 1129. For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; however, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory 1129 may include ROM 1106, RAM 1105, and a storage device 1114. A storage device 1114 may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., Bluray, CD ROM/RAM/Recordable (R)/ReWritable (RW), DVD R/RW, HD DVD R/RW etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); solid state memory devices (USB memory, solid state drives (SSD), etc.); other processor-readable storage mediums; and/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.
Component Collection
The memory 1129 may contain a collection of program and/or database components and/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s) 1115 (operating system); information server component(s) 1116 (information server); user interface component(s) 1117 (user interface); Web browser component(s) 1118 (Web browser); database(s) 1119; mail server component(s) 1121; mail client component(s) 1122; cryptographic server component(s) 1120 (cryptographic server); the AD-SURVEY component(s) 1135; and/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device 1114, they may also be loaded and/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and/or the like.
Operating System
The operating system component 1115 is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the AD-SURVEY controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 7; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and/or the like); and/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000/2003/3.1/95/98/CE/Millenium/NT/Vista/XP (Server), Palm OS, and/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may facilitate the interaction with communications networks, data, I/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the AD-SURVEY controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network 1113. Various communication protocols may be used by the AD-SURVEY controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP/IP, UDP, unicast, and/or the like.
Information Server
An information server component 1116 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D) hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol (WAP), WebObjects, and/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the AD-SURVEY controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http://123.124.125.126/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request â123.124.125.126â resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the â/myInformation.htmlâ portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information âmyInformation.html.â Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port 21, and/or the like. An information server may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the AD-SURVEY database 1119, operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and/or the like.
Access to the AD-SURVEY database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the AD-SURVEY. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the AD-SURVEY as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.
Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses.
User Interface
Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000/2003/3.1/95/98/CE/Millenium/NT/XP/Vista/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.
A user interface component 1117 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and/or atop operating systems and/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and/or operation of program components and/or system facilities through textual and/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses.
Web Browser
A Web browser component 1118 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and/or the like APIs), and/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and/or the like from the AD-SURVEY enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.
Mail Server
A mail server component 1121 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU 1103. The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POPS), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and/or otherwise traversing through and/or to the AD-SURVEY.
Access to the AD-SURVEY mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and/or the operating system.
Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, information, and/or responses.
Mail Client
A mail client component 1122 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU 1103. The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POPS, SMTP, and/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, information, and/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.
Cryptographic Server
A cryptographic server component 1120 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU 1103, cryptographic processor 1126, cryptographic processor interface 1127, cryptographic processor device 1128, and/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces may allow for expedition of encryption and/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and/or the like. The cryptographic component may facilitate numerous (encryption and/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the AD-SURVEY may encrypt all incoming and/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of âsecurity authorizationâ whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the AD-SURVEY component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the AD-SURVEY and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses.
The AD-SURVEY Database
The AD-SURVEY database component 1119 may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the âoneâ side of a one-to-many relationship.
Alternatively, the AD-SURVEY database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the AD-SURVEY database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the AD-SURVEY database 1119 may be integrated into another component such as the AD-SURVEY component 1135. Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and/or imported and thus decentralized and/or integrated.
In one embodiment, the database component 1119 includes several tables 1119 a-1. A user accounts table 1119 a includes fields such as, but not limited to: a UserID, UserName, UserPassword, UserAddress, UserDeviceID, UserViewingHistory, UserRating, UserPreference, and/or the like. The User table may support and/or track multiple entity accounts on a AD-SURVEY. A Real Time TV table 1119 b includes fields such as, but not limited to: TVChannelID, TVChannelName, TVChannelLogo, TVChannelAirTime, TVChannelProgram, TVChannelAd and/or the like. A Media Program table 1119 c includes fields such as, MediaID, MediaName, MediaLength, MediaSignature, MediaBrand, MediaTimeTag, MediaAd, MediaAdSponsor, MediaAirTime, MediaChannelID, and/or the like. A Survey Question table 1119 d includes fields such as QuestionID, QuestionCategory, QuestionAdID, QuestionDescription, QuestionResponse, QuestionMediaID, QuestionMediaTimeTag, QuestionUserID, and/or the like. An Ad table 1119 e includes fields such as, but not limited to: AdID, AdMerchant, AdFormat, AdProduct, AdText, AdTimeTag, AdMediaID, AdChannelID, AdAudioSignature, and/or the like. An Atmospherics table 1119 f includes fields such as, but not limited to: AtmosID, AtmosType, AtmosTimestamp, AtmosUserID, AtmosDeviceID, AtmosPhotoID, AtmosGPS, AtmosMediaID, AtmosChannelID, and/or the like. A User Device table 1119 g includes fields such as, but not limited to: DeviceID, DeviceType, DeviceHardwareID, DeviceMAC, DeviceAppInventory, and/or the like. A Reports table 1119 h includes fields such as, but not limited to: ReportID, ReportTimePeriod, ReportMediaID, ReportChannelID, ReportAdID, ReportType, ReportUserRating, ReportAdEffect, and/or the like. A social content table 1119 i includes fields such as, but not limited to: SocialID, SocialName, SocialUserID, SocialTokenID, SocialUserID, SocialSource, SocialContent, SocialTimeStamp, and/or the like. A Taxonomy table 1119 j includes fields such as, but not limited to: TaxpID, TaxoName, TaxoProducType, TaxoKeyWords, TaxoTreeNode, TaxoLevel, TaxoLabels, and/or the like. A User Token table 1119 k includes fields such as, but not limited to: TokenID, TokenUserID, TokenSocialID, TokenSocialSource, TokenNumber, TokenFile, and/or the like. An Analytics Weight Scores table 11191 includes fields such as, but not limited to: ScoreID, ScoreName, ScoreFactorAttribute, ScoreWeight, ScoreDescription, ScoreIndication, and/or the like.
In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search AD-SURVEY component may treat the combination of the AD-SURVEY database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.
In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the AD-SURVEY. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the AD-SURVEY may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and/or distributing the various database components 1119 a-1. The AD-SURVEY may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.
The AD-SURVEY database may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AD-SURVEY database communicates with the AD-SURVEY component, other program components, and/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.
The AD-SURVEYs
The AD-SURVEY component 1135 is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY component incorporates any and/or all combinations of the aspects of the AD-SURVEY that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the AD-SURVEY affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and/or the like across various communications networks.
The AD-SURVEY transforms TV program schedule listing information and user channel selection via AD-SURVEY components, such as real time TV 1042, ad survey synchronization 1043, atmospherics analysis 1044, audience statistics analysis 1045, social media connection 1046, media analytics 1047 and/or the like into TV audience viewing data and ad effects data.
The AD-SURVEY component facilitates access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and/or the like), WebObjects, and/or the like. In one embodiment, the AD-SURVEY server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The AD-SURVEY component may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AD-SURVEY component communicates with the AD-SURVEY database, operating systems, other program components, and/or the like. The AD-SURVEY may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses.
Distributed AD-SURVEYs
The structure and/or operation of any of the AD-SURVEY node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.
The component collection may be consolidated and/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.
The configuration of the AD-SURVEY controller may depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and/or the like.
If component collection components are discrete, separate, and/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and/or providing data with and/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.
For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:
    w3c-post http:// . . . Value1   
where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because âhttp://â is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable âValue1â may be inserted into an âhttp://â post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and/or instantiated, it itself may process and/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and/or the like. Again, the desired configuration may depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.
For example, in some implementations, the AD-SURVEY controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (âSSLâ) socket server via the information sherver, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (âSQLâ). An exemplary listing, written substantially in the form of PHP/SQL commands, to accept JSON-encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection, parse the data to extract variables, and store the data to a database, is provided below:



 



 




<?PHP


header(âContent-Type: text/plainâ);


// set ip address and port to listen to for incoming data


$address = â192.168.0.100â;


$port = 255;


// create a server-side SSL socket, listen for/accept incoming 


communication $sock = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);


socket_bind($sock, $address, $port) or die(âCould not bind to addressâ);


socket_listen($sock);


$client = socket_accept($sock);


// read input data from client device in 1024 byte blocks until end of 


message do {


ââââ$input = ââ;


ââââ$input = socket_read($client, 1024);


ââââ$data .= $input;


} while($input != ââ);


// parse data to extract variables
