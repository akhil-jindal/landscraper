DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Introduction
In one embodiment, transaction data, such as records of transactions made via credit accounts, debit accounts, prepaid accounts, bank accounts, stored value accounts and the like, is processed to provide information for various services, such as reporting, benchmarking, advertising, content or offer selection, customization, personalization, prioritization, etc.
In one embodiment, an advertising network is provided based on a transaction handler to present personalized or targeted advertisements/offers on behalf of advertisers. A computing apparatus of, or associated with, the transaction handler uses the transaction data and/or other data, such as account data, merchant data, search data, social networking data, web data, etc., to develop intelligence information about individual customers, or certain types or groups of customers. The intelligence information can be used to select, identify, generate, adjust, prioritize, and/or personalize advertisements/offers to the customers. In one embodiment, the transaction handler is further automated to process the advertisement fees charged to the advertisers, using the accounts of the advertisers, in response to the advertising activities.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is to generate trigger records for a transaction handler to identify authorization requests that satisfy the conditions specified in the trigger records, identify communication references of the users associated with the identified authorization requests, and use the communication references to target real-time messages at the users in parallel with the transaction handler providing responses to the respective authorization requests. Details in one embodiment regarding the generation and delivery of messages in real-time with the processing of transactions are provided in the section entitled âREAL-TIME MESSAGES.â
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is to receive an input specifying a set of users, identify a set of triggers (each of which corresponds to a set of one or more conditions which when satisfied cause transmission of a message to the set of users), rank the triggers based at least in part on the transaction data of the users that was recorded by the transaction handler, and generate a ranked list of the triggers based on the ranking. In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is to select one or more triggers from the ranked list for a marketer. In another embodiment, the ranked list is presented to a marketer for selection. Details in one embodiment regarding the ranking and selecting of triggers for the generation and delivery of real-time messages are provided in the section entitled âTRIGGER RANK.â
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is to identify a set of users, identify a plurality of triggers (each of which corresponds to a set of one or more conditions which when satisfied by a transaction of a user from the set, as the transaction is being processed by the transaction handler, cause transmission of an advertisement to the user), provide a graphical representation of triggers, and provide data related to the triggers on the graphical representation, in response to user interaction with the graphical representation. In one embodiment, the graphical representation includes a map showing locations of the triggers, the location of desired transactions to be caused by the advertisement, and indication of ranks of the triggers ranked using the transaction data of the transaction handler. Details in one embodiment regarding the visualization of triggers for the generation and delivery of real-time messages are provided in the section entitled âTRIGGER VISUALIZATION.â
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured with a cooperative database that organizes data and/or participants according to communities to allow merchants to deliver offers via different merchants or advertisers. In one embodiment, the computing apparatus allows a merchant to target cardholders based on a different community or participating list. For example, through the use of the cooperative database, merchant A can utilize merchant B's list to identify cardholders who have not shopped at merchant A and then send a targeted offer to the identified cardholders. Thus, the cooperative database allows merchants to identify customer acquisition opportunities to send offers to cardholders who have not shopped at or have not recently been to the stores of the merchants. Details in one embodiment regarding the use of a cooperative database for the generation and delivery of real-time messages are provided in the section entitled âCOOPERATIVE DATABASE.â
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus correlates transactions with activities that occurred outside the context of the transaction, such as online advertisements presented to the customers that at least in part cause offline transactions. The correlation data can be used to demonstrate the success of the advertisements, and/or to improve intelligence information about how individual customers and/or various types or groups of customers respond to the advertisements.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus correlates, or provides information to facilitate the correlation of, transactions with online activities of the customers, such as searching, web browsing, social networking and consuming advertisements, with other activities, such as watching television programs, and/or with events, such as meetings, announcements, natural disasters, accidents, news announcements, etc.
In one embodiment, the correlation results are used in predictive models to predict transactions and/or spending patterns based on activities or events, to predict activities or events based on transactions or spending patterns, to provide alerts or reports, etc.
In one embodiment, a single entity operating the transaction handler performs various operations in the services provided based on the transaction data. For example, in the presentation of the personalized or targeted advertisements, the single entity may perform the operations such as generating the intelligence information, selecting relevant intelligence information for a given audience, selecting, identifying, adjusting, prioritizing, personalizing and/or generating advertisements based on selected relevant intelligence information, and facilitating the delivery of personalized or targeted advertisements, etc. Alternatively, the entity operating the transaction handler cooperates with one or more other entities by providing information to these entities to allow these entities to perform at least some of the operations for presentation of the personalized or targeted advertisements.
System
 FIG. 1 illustrates a system to provide services based on transaction data according to one embodiment. In FIG. 1, the system includes a transaction terminal (105) to initiate financial transactions for a user (101), a transaction handler (103) to generate transaction data (109) from processing the financial transactions of the user (101) (and the financial transactions of other users), a profile generator (121) to generate transaction profiles (127) based on the transaction data (109) to provide information/intelligence about user preferences and spending patterns, a point of interaction (107) to provide information and/or offers to the user (101), a user tracker (113) to generate user data (125) to identify the user (101) using the point of interaction (107), a profile selector (129) to select a profile (131) specific to the user (101) identified by the user data (125), and an advertisement selector (133) to select, identify, generate, adjust, prioritize and/or personalize advertisements for presentation to the user (101) on the point of interaction (107) via a media controller (115).
In one embodiment, the system further includes a correlator (117) to correlate user specific advertisement data (119) with transactions resulting from the user specific advertisement data (119). The correlation results (123) can be used by the profile generator (121) to improve the transaction profiles (127).
In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) are generated from the transaction data (109) in a way as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. For example, in FIG. 3, an aggregated spending profile (341) is generated via the factor analysis (327) and cluster analysis (329) to summarize (335) the spending patterns/behaviors reflected in the transaction records (301).
In one embodiment, a data warehouse (149) as illustrated in FIG. 4 is coupled with the transaction handler (103) to store the transaction data (109) and other data, such as account data (111), transaction profiles (127) and correlation results (123). In FIG. 4, a portal (143) is coupled with the data warehouse (149) to provide data or information derived from the transaction data (109), in response to a query request from a third party or as an alert or notification message.
In FIG. 4, the transaction handler (103) is coupled between an issuer processor (145) in control of a consumer account (146) and an acquirer processor (147) in control of a merchant account (148). An account identification device (141) is configured to carry the account information (142) that identifies the consumer account (146) with the issuer processor (145) and provide the account information (142) to the transaction terminal (105) of a merchant to initiate a transaction between the user (101) and the merchant.
 FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate examples of transaction terminals (105) and account identification devices (141). FIG. 7 illustrates the structure of a data processing system that can be used to implement, with more or fewer elements, at least some of the components in the system, such as the point of interaction (107), the transaction handler (103), the portal (143), the data warehouse (149), the account identification device (141), the transaction terminal (105), the user tracker (113), the profile generator (121), the profile selector (129), the advertisement selector (133), the media controller (115), etc. Some embodiments use more or fewer components than those illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 4-7, as further discussed in the section entitled âVARIATIONS.â
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) relates to financial transactions processed by the transaction handler (103); and the account data (111) relates to information about the account holders involved in the transactions. Further data, such as merchant data that relates to the location, business, products and/or services of the merchants that receive payments from account holders for their purchases, can be used in the generation of the transaction profiles (127, 341).
In one embodiment, the financial transactions are made via an account identification device (141), such as financial transaction cards (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, banking cards, etc.); the financial transaction cards may be embodied in various devices, such as plastic cards, chips, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc.; and the financial transaction cards may be represented by account identifiers (e.g., account numbers or aliases). In one embodiment, the financial transactions are made via directly using the account information (142), without physically presenting the account identification device (141).
Further features, modifications and details are provided in various sections of this description.
Centralized Data Warehouse
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) maintains a centralized data warehouse (149) organized around the transaction data (109). For example, the centralized data warehouse (149) may include, and/or support the determination of, spending band distribution, transaction count and amount, merchant categories, merchant by state, cardholder segmentation by velocity scores, and spending within merchant target, competitive set and cross-section.
In one embodiment, the centralized data warehouse (149) provides centralized management but allows decentralized execution. For example, a third party strategic marketing analyst, statistician, marketer, promoter, business leader, etc., may access the centralized data warehouse (149) to analyze customer and shopper data, to provide follow-up analyses of customer contributions, to develop propensity models for increased conversion of marketing campaigns, to develop segmentation models for marketing, etc. The centralized data warehouse (149) can be used to manage advertisement campaigns and analyze response profitability.
In one embodiment, the centralized data warehouse (149) includes merchant data (e.g., data about sellers), customer/business data (e.g., data about buyers), and transaction records (301) between sellers and buyers over time. The centralized data warehouse (149) can be used to support corporate sales forecasting, fraud analysis reporting, sales/customer relationship management (CRM) business intelligence, credit risk prediction and analysis, advanced authorization reporting, merchant benchmarking, business intelligence for small business, rewards, etc.
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) is combined with external data, such as surveys, benchmarks, search engine statistics, demographics, competition information, emails, etc., to flag key events and data values, to set customer, merchant, data or event triggers, and to drive new transactions and new customer contacts.
Transaction Profile
In FIG. 1, the profile generator (121) generates transaction profiles (127) based on the transaction data (109), the account data (111), and/or other data, such as non-transactional data, wish lists, merchant provided information, address information, information from social network websites, information from credit bureaus, information from search engines, information about insurance claims, information from DNA databanks, and other examples discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/614,603, filed Nov. 9, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0054981, and entitled âAnalyzing Local Non-Transactional Data with Transactional Data in Predictive Models,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) provide intelligence information on the behavior, pattern, preference, propensity, tendency, frequency, trend, and budget of the user (101) in making purchases. In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include information about what the user (101) owns, such as points, miles, or other rewards currency, available credit, and received offers, such as coupons loaded into the accounts of the user (101). In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include information based on past offer/coupon redemption patterns. In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include information on shopping patterns in retail stores as well as online, including frequency of shopping, amount spent in each shopping trip, distance of merchant location (retail) from the address of the account holder(s), etc.
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) provides at least part of the intelligence for the prioritization, generation, selection, customization and/or adjustment of an advertisement for delivery within a transaction process involving the transaction handler (103). For example, the advertisement may be presented to a customer in response to the customer making a payment via the transaction handler (103).
Some of the transaction profiles (127) are specific to the user (101), or to an account of the user (101), or to a group of users of which the user (101) is a member, such as a household, family, company, neighborhood, city, or group identified by certain characteristics related to online activities, offline purchase activities, merchant propensity, etc.
In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) generates and updates the transaction profiles (127) in batch mode periodically. In other embodiments, the profile generator (121) generates the transaction profiles (127) in real-time, or just in time, in response to a request received in the portal (143) for such profiles.
In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include the values for a set of parameters. Computing the values of the parameters may involve counting transactions that meet one or more criteria, and/or building a statistically-based model in which one or more calculated values or transformed values are put into a statistical algorithm that weights each value to optimize its collective predictiveness for various predetermined purposes.
Further details and examples about the transaction profiles (127) in one embodiment are provided in the section entitled âAGGREGATED SPENDING PROFILE.â
Non-Transactional Data
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) is analyzed in connection with non-transactional data to generate transaction profiles (127) and/or to make predictive models.
In one embodiment, transactions are correlated with non-transactional events, such as news, conferences, shows, announcements, market changes, natural disasters, etc. to establish cause and effect relationships to predict future transactions or spending patterns. For example, non-transactional data may include the geographic location of a news event, the date of an event from an events calendar, the name of a performer for an upcoming concert, etc. The non-transactional data can be obtained from various sources, such as newspapers, websites, blogs, social networking sites, etc.
In one embodiment, when the cause and effect relationships between the transactions and non-transactional events are known (e.g., based on prior research results, domain knowledge, expertise), the relationships can be used in predictive models to predict future transactions or spending patterns, based on events that occurred recently or are happening in real-time.
In one embodiment, the non-transactional data relates to events that happened in a geographical area local to the user (101) that performed the respective transactions. In one embodiment, a geographical area is local to the user (101) when the distance from the user (101) to locations in the geographical area is within a convenient range for daily or regular travel, such as 20, 50 or 100 miles from an address of the user (101), or within the same city or zip code area of an address of the user (101). Examples of analyses of local non-transactional data in connection with transaction data (109) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/614,603, filed Nov. 9, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0054981, and entitled âAnalyzing Local Non-Transactional Data with Transactional Data in Predictive Models,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the non-transactional data is not limited to local non-transactional data. For example, national non-transactional data can also be used.
In one embodiment, the transaction records (301) are analyzed in frequency domain to identify periodic features in spending events. The periodic features in the past transaction records (301) can be used to predict the probability of a time window in which a similar transaction will occur. For example, the analysis of the transaction data (109) can be used to predict when a next transaction having the periodic feature will occur, with which merchant, the probability of a repeated transaction with a certain amount, the probability of exception, the opportunity to provide an advertisement or offer such as a coupon, etc. In one embodiment, the periodic features are detected through counting the number of occurrences of pairs of transactions that occurred within a set of predetermined time intervals and separating the transaction pairs based on the time intervals. Some examples and techniques for the prediction of future transactions based on the detection of periodic features in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/773,770, filed May 4, 2010, published as 2010/0280882, and entitled âFrequency-Based Transaction Prediction and Processing,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Techniques and details of predictive modeling in one embodiment are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,119,103, 6,018,723, 6,658,393, 6,598,030, and 7,227,950, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, offers are based on the point-of-service to offeree distance to allow the user (101) to obtain in-person services. In one embodiment, the offers are selected based on transaction history and shopping patterns in the transaction data (109) and/or the distance between the user (101) and the merchant. In one embodiment, offers are provided in response to a request from the user (101), or in response to a detection of the location of the user (101). Examples and details of at least one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/767,218, filed Jun. 22, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0319843, and entitled âSupply of Requested Offer Based on Point-of Service to Offeree Distance,â U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/755,575, filed May 30, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0300973, and entitled âSupply of Requested Offer Based on Offeree Transaction History,â U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/855,042, filed Sep. 13, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2009/0076896, and entitled âMerchant Supplied Offer to a Consumer within a Predetermined Distance,â U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/855,069, filed Sep. 13, 2007, assigned Pub.

No. 2010/0274627, and entitled âReceiving an Announcement Triggered by Location Data,â the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Targeting Advertisement
In FIG. 1, an advertisement selector (133) prioritizes, generates, selects, adjusts, and/or customizes the available advertisement data (135) to provide user specific advertisement data (119) based at least in part on the user specific profile (131). The advertisement selector (133) uses the user specific profile (131) as a filter and/or a set of criteria to generate, identify, select and/or prioritize advertisement data for the user (101). A media controller (115) delivers the user specific advertisement data (119) to the point of interaction (107) for presentation to the user (101) as the targeted and/or personalized advertisement.
In one embodiment, the user data (125) includes the characterization of the context at the point of interaction (107). Thus, the use of the user specific profile (131), selected using the user data (125), includes the consideration of the context at the point of interaction (107) in selecting the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, in selecting the user specific advertisement data (119), the advertisement selector (133) uses not only the user specific profile (131), but also information regarding the context at the point of interaction (107). For example, in one embodiment, the user data (125) includes information regarding the context at the point of interaction (107); and the advertisement selector (133) explicitly uses the context information in the generation or selection of the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) may query for specific information regarding the user (101) before providing the user specific advertisement data (119). The queries may be communicated to the operator of the transaction handler (103) and, in particular, to the transaction handler (103) or the profile generator (121). For example, the queries from the advertisement selector (133) may be transmitted and received in accordance with an application programming interface or other query interface of the transaction handler (103), the profile generator (121) or the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103).
In one embodiment, the queries communicated from the advertisement selector (133) may request intelligence information regarding the user (101) at any level of specificity (e.g., segment level, individual level). For example, the queries may include a request for a certain field or type of information in a cardholder's aggregated spending profile (341). As another example, the queries may include a request for the spending level of the user (101) in a certain merchant category over a prior time period (e.g., six months).
In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) is operated by an entity that is separate from the entity that operates the transaction handler (103). For example, the advertisement selector (133) may be operated by a search engine, a publisher, an advertiser, an ad network, or an online merchant. The user specific profile (131) is provided to the advertisement selector (133) to assist in the customization of the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, advertising is targeted based on shopping patterns in a merchant category (e.g., as represented by a Merchant Category Code (MCC)) that has high correlation of spending propensity with other merchant categories (e.g., other MCCs). For example, in the context of a first MCC for a targeted audience, a profile identifying second MCCs that have high correlation of spending propensity with the first MCC can be used to select advertisements for the targeted audience.
In one embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) is used to provide intelligence information about the spending patterns, preferences, and/or trends of the user (101). For example, a predictive model can be established based on the aggregated spending profile (341) to estimate the needs of the user (101). For example, the factor values (344) and/or the cluster ID (343) in the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used to determine the spending preferences of the user (101). For example, the channel distribution (345) in the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used to provide a customized offer targeted for a particular channel, based on the spending patterns of the user (101).
In one embodiment, mobile advertisements, such as offers and coupons, are generated and disseminated based on aspects of prior purchases, such as timing, location, and nature of the purchases, etc. In one embodiment, the size of the benefit of the offer or coupon is based on purchase volume or spending amount of the prior purchase and/or the subsequent purchase that may qualify for the redemption of the offer. Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/960,162, filed Dec. 19, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0201226, and entitled âMobile Coupon Method and Portable Consumer Device for Utilizing same,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, conditional rewards are provided to the user (101); and the transaction handler (103) monitors the transactions of the user (101) to identify redeemable rewards that have satisfied the respective conditions. In one embodiment, the conditional rewards are selected based on transaction data (109). Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/862,487, filed Sep. 27, 2007 and entitled âConsumer Specific Conditional Rewards,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The techniques to detect the satisfied conditions of conditional rewards can also be used to detect the transactions that satisfy the conditions specified to locate the transactions that result from online activities, such as online advertisements, searches, etc., to correlate the transactions with the respective online activities.
Further details about targeted offer delivery in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/185,332, filed Aug. 4, 2008, assigned Pub. No. 2010/0030644, and entitled âTargeted Advertising by Payment Processor History of Cashless Acquired Merchant Transaction on Issued Consumer Account,â and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/849,793, filed Aug. 3, 2010, assigned Pub. No. 2011/0035280, and entitled âSystems and Methods for Targeted Advertisement Delivery,â the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Profile Matching
In FIG. 1, the user tracker (113) obtains and generates context information about the user (101) at the point of interaction (107), including user data (125) that characterizes and/or identifies the user (101). The profile selector (129) selects a user specific profile (131) from the set of transaction profiles (127) generated by the profile generator (121), based on matching the characteristics of the transaction profiles (127) and the characteristics of the user data (125). For example, the user data (125) indicates a set of characteristics of the user (101); and the profile selector (129) selects the user specific profile (131) for a particular user or group of users that best matches the set of characteristics specified by the user data (125).
In one embodiment, the profile selector (129) receives the transaction profiles (127) in a batch mode. The profile selector (129) selects the user specific profile (131) from the batch of transaction profiles (127) based on the user data (125). Alternatively, the profile generator (121) generates the transaction profiles (127) in real-time; and the profile selector (129) uses the user data (125) to query the profile generator (121) to generate the user specific profile (131) in real-time, or just in time. The profile generator (121) generates the user specific profile (131) that best matches the user data (125).
In one embodiment, the user tracker (113) identifies the user (101) based on the user's activity on the transaction terminal (105) (e.g., having visited a set of websites, currently visiting a type of web pages, search behavior, etc.).
In one embodiment, the user data (125) includes an identifier of the user (101), such as a global unique identifier (GUID), a personal account number (PAN) (e.g., credit card number, debit card number, or other card account number), or other identifiers that uniquely and persistently identify the user (101) within a set of identifiers of the same type. Alternatively, the user data (125) may include other identifiers, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user (101), a name or user name of the user (101), or a browser cookie ID, which identify the user (101) in a local, temporary, transient and/or anonymous manner. Some of these identifiers of the user (101) may be provided by publishers, advertisers, ad networks, search engines, merchants, or the user tracker (113). In one embodiment, such identifiers are correlated to the user (101) based on the overlapping or proximity of the time period of their usage to establish an identification reference table.
In one embodiment, the identification reference table is used to identify the account information (142) (e.g., account number (302)) based on characteristics of the user (101) captured in the user data (125), such as browser cookie ID, IP addresses, and/or timestamps on the usage of the IP addresses. In one embodiment, the identification reference table is maintained by the operator of the transaction handler (103). Alternatively, the identification reference table is maintained by an entity other than the operator of the transaction handler (103).
In one embodiment, the user tracker (113) determines certain characteristics of the user (101) to describe a type or group of users of which the user (101) is a member. The transaction profile of the group is used as the user specific profile (131). Examples of such characteristics include geographical location or neighborhood, types of online activities, specific online activities, or merchant propensity. In one embodiment, the groups are defined based on aggregate information (e.g., by time of day, or household), or segment (e.g., by cluster, propensity, demographics, cluster IDs, and/or factor values). In one embodiment, the groups are defined in part via one or more social networks. For example, a group may be defined based on social distances to one or more users on a social network website, interactions between users on a social network website, and/or common data in social network profiles of the users in the social network website.
In one embodiment, the user data (125) may match different profiles at a different granularity or resolution (e.g., account, user, family, company, neighborhood, etc.), with different degrees of certainty. The profile selector (129) and/or the profile generator (121) may determine or select the user specific profile (131) with the finest granularity or resolution with acceptable certainty. Thus, the user specific profile (131) is most specific or closely related to the user (101).
In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) uses further data in prioritizing, selecting, generating, customizing and adjusting the user specific advertisement data (119). For example, the advertisement selector (133) may use search data in combination with the user specific profile (131) to provide benefits or offers to a user (101) at the point of interaction (107). For example, the user specific profile (131) can be used to personalize the advertisement, such as adjusting the placement of the advertisement relative to other advertisements, adjusting the appearance of the advertisement, etc.
Browser Cookie
In one embodiment, the user data (125) uses browser cookie information to identify the user (101). The browser cookie information is matched to account information (142) or the account number (302) to identify the user specific profile (131), such as aggregated spending profile (341), to present effective, timely, and relevant marketing information to the user (101) via the preferred communication channel (e.g., mobile communications, web, mail, email, point-of-sale (POS) terminal, etc.) within a window of time that could influence the spending behavior of the user (101). Based on the transaction data (109), the user specific profile (131) can improve audience targeting for online advertising. Thus, customers will get better advertisements and offers presented to them; and the advertisers will achieve better return-on-investment for their advertisement campaigns.
In one embodiment, the browser cookie that identifies the user (101) in online activities, such as web browsing, online searching, and using social networking applications, can be matched to an identifier of the user (101) in account data (111), such as the account number (302) of a financial payment card of the user (101) or the account information (142) of the account identification device (141) of the user (101). In one embodiment, the identifier of the user (101) can be uniquely identified via matching IP address, timestamp, cookie ID and/or other user data (125) observed by the user tracker (113).
In one embodiment, a look up table is used to map browser cookie information (e.g., IP address, timestamp, cookie ID) to the account data (111) that identifies the user (101) in the transaction handler (103). The look up table may be established via correlating overlapping or common portions of the user data (125) observed by different entities or different user trackers (113).
For example, in one embodiment, a first user tracker (113) observes the card number of the user (101) at a particular IP address for a time period identified by a timestamp (e.g., via an online payment process); and a second user tracker (113) observes the user (101) having a cookie ID at the same IP address for a time period near or overlapping with the time period observed by the first user tracker (113). Thus, the cookie ID as observed by the second user tracker (113) can be linked to the card number of the user (101) as observed by the first user tracker (113). The first user tracker (113) may be operated by the same entity operating the transaction handler (103) or by a different entity. Once the correlation between the cookie ID and the card number is established via a database or a look up table, the cookie ID can be subsequently used to identify the card number of the user (101) and the account data (111).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to observe a card number of a user (101) while the user (101) uses an IP address to make an online transaction. Thus, the portal (143) can identify a consumer account (146) based on correlating an IP address used to identify the user (101) and IP addresses recorded in association with the consumer account (146).
For example, in one embodiment, when the user (101) makes a payment online by submitting the account information (142) to the transaction terminal (105) (e.g., an online store), the transaction handler (103) obtains the IP address from the transaction terminal (105) via the acquirer processor (147). The transaction handler (103) stores data to indicate the use of the account information (142) at the IP address at the time of the transaction request. When an IP address in the query received in the portal (143) matches the IP address previously recorded by the transaction handler (103), the portal (143) determines that the user (101) identified by the IP address in the request is the same user (101) associated with the account used in the transaction initiated at the IP address. In one embodiment, a match is found when the time of the query request is within a predetermined time period from the transaction request, such as a few minutes, one hour, a day, etc. In one embodiment, the query may also include a cookie ID representing the user (101). Thus, through matching the IP address, the cookie ID is associated with the account information (142) in a persistent way.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) obtains the IP address of the online transaction directly. For example, in one embodiment, a user (101) chooses to use a password in the account data (111) to protect the account information (142) for online transactions. When the account information (142) is entered into the transaction terminal (105) (e.g., an online store or an online shopping cart system), the user (101) is connected to the portal (143) for the verification of the password (e.g., via a pop up window, or via redirecting the web browser of the user (101)). The transaction handler (103) accepts the transaction request after the password is verified via the portal (143). Through this verification process, the portal (143) and/or the transaction handler (103) obtain the IP address of the user (101) at the time the account information (142) is used.
In one embodiment, the web browser of the user (101) communicates the user-provided password to the portal (143) directly without going through the transaction terminal (105) (e.g., the server of the merchant). Alternatively, the transaction terminal (105) and/or the acquirer processor (147) may relay the password communication to the portal (143) or the transaction handler (103).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to identify the consumer account (146) based on the IP address identified in the user data (125) through mapping the IP address to a street address. For example, in one embodiment, the user data (125) includes an IP address to identify the user (101); and the portal (143) can use a service to map the IP address to a street address. For example, an Internet service provider knows the street address of the currently assigned IP address. Once the street address is identified, the portal (143) can use the account data (111) to identify the consumer account (146) that has a current address at the identified street address. Once the consumer account (146) is identified, the portal (143) can provide a transaction profile (131) specific to the consumer account (146) of the user (101).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) uses a plurality of methods to identify consumer accounts (146) based on the user data (125). The portal (143) combines the results from the different methods to determine the most likely consumer account (146) for the user data (125).
Details about the identification of consumer account (146) based on user data (125) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/849,798, filed Aug. 3, 2010, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0093327, and entitled âSystems and Methods to Match Identifiers,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Close the Loop
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is used to âclose the loopâ for the tracking of consumer behavior across an on-line activity and an âoff-lineâ activity that results at least in part from the on-line activity. In one embodiment, online activities, such as searching, web browsing, social networking, and/or consuming online advertisements, are correlated with respective transactions to generate the correlation result (123) in FIG. 1. The respective transactions may occur offline, in âbrick and mortarâ retail stores, or online but in a context outside the online activities, such as a credit card purchase that is performed in a way not visible to a search company that facilitates the search activities.
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is to identify transactions resulting from searches or online advertisements. For example, in response to a query about the user (101) from the user tracker (113), the correlator (117) identifies an offline transaction performed by the user (101) and sends the correlation result (123) about the offline transaction to the user tracker (113), which allows the user tracker (113) to combine the information about the offline transaction and the online activities to provide significant marketing advantages.
For example, a marketing department could correlate an advertising budget to actual sales. For example, a marketer can use the correlation result (123) to study the effect of certain prioritization strategies, customization schemes, etc. on the impact on the actual sales. For example, the correlation result (123) can be used to adjust or prioritize advertisement placement on a website, a search engine, a social networking site, an online marketplace, or the like.
In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) uses the correlation result (123) to augment the transaction profiles (127) with data indicating the rate of conversion from searches or advertisements to purchase transactions. In one embodiment, the correlation result (123) is used to generate predictive models to determine what a user (101) is likely to purchase when the user (101) is searching using certain keywords or when the user (101) is presented with an advertisement or offer. In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to report the correlation result (123) to a partner, such as a search engine, a publisher, or a merchant, to allow the partner to use the correlation result (123) to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and/or search result customization, to arrange rewards, etc.
Illustratively, a search engine entity may display a search page with particular advertisements for flat panel televisions produced by companies A, B, and C. The search engine entity may then compare the particular advertisements presented to a particular consumer with transaction data of that consumer and may determine that the consumer purchased a flat panel television produced by Company B. The search engine entity may then use this information and other information derived from the behavior of other consumers to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements provided by companies A, B, and C. The search engine entity can determine if the placement, appearance, or other characteristic of the advertisement results in actual increased sales. Adjustments to advertisements (e.g., placement, appearance, etc.) may be made to facilitate maximum sales.
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) matches the online activities and the transactions based on matching the user data (125) provided by the user tracker (113) and the records of the transactions, such as transaction data (109) or transaction records (301). In another embodiment, the correlator (117) matches the online activities and the transactions based on the redemption of offers/benefits provided in the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to receive a set of conditions and an identification of the user (101), determine whether there is any transaction of the user (101) that satisfies the set of conditions, and if so, provide indications of the transactions that satisfy the conditions and/or certain details about the transactions, which allows the requester to correlate the transactions with certain user activities, such as searching, web browsing, consuming advertisements, etc.
In one embodiment, the requester may not know the account number (302) of the user (101); and the portal (143) is to map the identifier provided in the request to the account number (302) of the user (101) to provide the requested information. Examples of the identifier being provided in the request to identify the user (101) include an identification of an iFrame of a web page visited by the user (101), a browser cookie ID, an IP address and the day and time corresponding to the use of the IP address, etc.
The information provided by the portal (143) can be used in pre-purchase marketing activities, such as customizing content or offers, prioritizing content or offers, selecting content or offers, etc., based on the spending pattern of the user (101). The content that is customized, prioritized, selected, or recommended may be the search results, blog entries, items for sale, etc.
The information provided by the portal (143) can be used in post-purchase activities. For example, the information can be used to correlate an offline purchase with online activities. For example, the information can be used to determine purchases made in response to media events, such as television programs, advertisements, news announcements, etc.
Details about profile delivery, online activity to offline purchase tracking, techniques to identify the user specific profile (131) based on user data (125) (such as IP addresses), and targeted delivery of advertisement/offer/benefit in some embodiments are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/849,789, filed Aug. 3, 2010, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0035278, and entitled âSystems and Methods for Closing the Loop between Online Activities and Offline Purchases,â the disclosure of which application is incorporated herein by reference.
Matching Advertisement & Transaction
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is configured to receive information about the user specific advertisement data (119), monitor the transaction data (109), identify transactions that can be considered results of the advertisement corresponding to the user specific advertisement data (119), and generate the correlation result (123), as illustrated in FIG. 1.
When the advertisement and the corresponding transaction both occur in an online checkout process, a website used for the online checkout process can be used to correlate the transaction and the advertisement. However, the advertisement and the transaction may occur in separate processes and/or under control of different entities (e.g., when the purchase is made offline at a retail store, whereas the advertisement is presented outside the retail store). In one embodiment, the correlator (117) uses a set of correlation criteria to identify the transactions that can be considered as the results of the advertisements.
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) identifies the transactions linked or correlated to the user specific advertisement data (119) based on various criteria. For example, the user specific advertisement data (119) may include a coupon offering a benefit contingent upon a purchase made according to the user specific advertisement data (119). The use of the coupon identifies the user specific advertisement data (119), and thus allows the correlator (117) to correlate the transaction with the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, the user specific advertisement data (119) is associated with the identity or characteristics of the user (101), such as global unique identifier (GUID), personal account number (PAN), alias, IP address, name or user name, geographical location or neighborhood, household, user group, and/or user data (125). The correlator (117) can link or match the transactions with the advertisements based on the identity or characteristics of the user (101) associated with the user specific advertisement data (119). For example, the portal (143) may receive a query identifying the user data (125) that tracks the user (101) and/or characteristics of the user specific advertisement data (119); and the correlator (117) identifies one or more transactions matching the user data (125) and/or the characteristics of the user specific advertisement data (119) to generate the correlation result (123).
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) identifies the characteristics of the transactions and uses the characteristics to search for advertisements that match the transactions. Such characteristics may include GUID, PAN, IP address, card number, browser cookie information, coupon, alias, etc.
In FIG. 1, the profile generator (121) uses the correlation result (123) to enhance the transaction profiles (127) generated from the profile generator (121). The correlation result (123) provides details on purchases and/or indicates the effectiveness of the user specific advertisement data (119).
In one embodiment, the correlation result (123) is used to demonstrate to the advertisers the effectiveness of the advertisements, to process incentive or rewards associated with the advertisements, to obtain at least a portion of advertisement revenue based on the effectiveness of the advertisements, to improve the selection of advertisements, etc.
Coupon Matching
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) identifies a transaction that is a result of an advertisement (e.g., 119) when an offer or benefit provided in the advertisement is redeemed via the transaction handler (103) in connection with a purchase identified in the advertisement.
For example, in one embodiment, when the offer is extended to the user (101), information about the offer can be stored in association with the account of the user (101) (e.g., as part of the account data (111)). The user (101) may visit the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) to view the stored offer.
The offer stored in the account of the user (101) may be redeemed via the transaction handler (103) in various ways. For example, in one embodiment, the correlator (117) may download the offer to the transaction terminal (105) via the transaction handler (103) when the characteristics of the transaction at the transaction terminal (105) match the characteristics of the offer.
After the offer is downloaded to the transaction terminal (105), the transaction terminal (105) automatically applies the offer when the condition of the offer is satisfied in one embodiment. Alternatively, the transaction terminal (105) allows the user (101) to selectively apply the offers downloaded by the correlator (117) or the transaction handler (103). In one embodiment, the correlator (117) sends reminders to the user (101) at a separate point of interaction (107) (e.g., a mobile phone) to remind the user (101) to redeem the offer. In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) applies the offer (e.g., via statement credit), without having to download the offer (e.g., coupon) to the transaction terminal (105). Examples and details of redeeming offers via statement credit are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/566,350, filed Sep. 24, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0114686, and entitled âReal-Time Statement Credits and Notifications,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the offer is captured as an image and stored in association with the account of the user (101). Alternatively, the offer is captured in a text format (e.g., a code and a set of criteria), without replicating the original image of the coupon.
In one embodiment, when the coupon is redeemed, the advertisement presenting the coupon is correlated with a transaction in which the coupon is redeemed, and/or is determined to have resulted in a transaction. In one embodiment, the correlator (117) identifies advertisements that have resulted in purchases, without having to identify the specific transactions that correspond to the advertisements.
Details about offer redemption via the transaction handler (103) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/849,801, filed Aug. 3, 2010, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0125565, and entitled âSystems and Methods for Multi-Channel Offer Redemption,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
On ATM & POS Terminal
In one example, the transaction terminal (105) is an automatic teller machine (ATM), which is also the point of interaction (107). When the user (101) approaches the ATM to make a transaction (e.g., to withdraw cash via a credit card or debit card), the ATM transmits account information (142) to the transaction handler (103). The account information (142) can also be considered as the user data (125) to select the user specific profile (131). The user specific profile (131) can be sent to an advertisement network to query for a targeted advertisement. After the advertisement network matches the user specific profile (131) with user specific advertisement data (119) (e.g., a targeted advertisement), the transaction handler (103) may send the advertisement to the ATM, together with the authorization for cash withdrawal.
In one embodiment, the advertisement shown on the ATM includes a coupon that offers a benefit that is contingent upon the user (101) making a purchase according to the advertisement. The user (101) may view the offer presented on a white space on the ATM screen and select to load or store the coupon in a storage device of the transaction handler (103) under the account of the user (101). The transaction handler (103) communicates with the bank to process the cash withdrawal. After the cash withdrawal, the ATM prints the receipt, which includes a confirmation of the coupon, or a copy of the coupon. The user (101) may then use the coupon printed on the receipt. Alternatively, when the user (101) uses the same account to make a relevant purchase, the transaction handler (103) may automatically apply the coupon stored under the account of the user (101), automatically download the coupon to the relevant transaction terminal (105), or transmit the coupon to the mobile phone of the user (101) to allow the user (101) to use the coupon via a display of the coupon on the mobile phone. The user (101) may visit a web portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) to view the status of the coupons collected in the account of the user (101).
In one embodiment, the advertisement is forwarded to the ATM via the data stream for authorization. In another embodiment, the ATM makes a separate request to a server of the transaction handler (103) (e.g., a web portal) to obtain the advertisement. Alternatively, or in combination, the advertisement (including the coupon) is provided to the user (101) at separate, different points of interactions, such as via a text message to a mobile phone of the user (101), via an email, via a bank statement, etc.
Details of presenting targeted advertisements on ATMs based on purchasing preferences and location data in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/266,352, filed Nov. 6, 2008, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0114677, and entitled âSystem Including Automated Teller Machine with Data Bearing Medium,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In another example, the transaction terminal (105) is a POS terminal at the checkout station in a retail store (e.g., a self-service checkout register). When the user (101) pays for a purchase via a payment card (e.g., a credit card or a debit card), the transaction handler (103) provides a targeted advertisement having a coupon obtained from an advertisement network. The user (101) may load the coupon into the account of the payment card and/or obtain a hardcopy of the coupon from the receipt. When the coupon is used in a transaction, the advertisement is linked to the transaction.
Details of presenting targeted advertisements during the process of authorizing a financial payment card transaction in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/799,549, filed May 1, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0275771, and entitled âMerchant Transaction Based Advertising,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the user specific advertisement data (119), such as offers or coupons, is provided to the user (101) via the transaction terminal (105) in connection with an authorization message during the authorization of a transaction processed by the transaction handler (103). The authorization message can be used to communicate the rewards qualified for by the user (101) in response to the current transaction, the status and/or balance of rewards in a loyalty program, etc. Examples and details related to the authorization process in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/266,766, filed Nov. 2, 2005, assigned Pub. No. 2007/0100691, and entitled âMethod and System for Conducting Promotional Programs,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, when the user (101) is conducting a transaction with a first merchant via the transaction handler (103), the transaction handler (103) may determine whether the characteristics of the transaction satisfy the conditions specified for an announcement, such as an advertisement, offer or coupon, from a second merchant. If the conditions are satisfied, the transaction handler (103) provides the announcement to the user (101). In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) may auction the opportunity to provide the announcements to a set of merchants. Examples and details related to the delivery of such announcements in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/428,241, filed Apr. 22, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0274625, and entitled âTargeting Merchant Announcements Triggered by Consumer Activity Relative to a Surrogate Merchant,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Details about delivering advertisements at a point of interaction that is associated with user transaction interactions in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/849,791, filed Aug. 3, 2010, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0087550, and entitled âSystems and Methods to Deliver Targeted Advertisements to Audience,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
On Third Party Site
In a further example, the user (101) may visit a third party website, which is the point of interaction (107) in FIG. 1. The third party website may be a web search engine, a news website, a blog, a social network site, etc. The behavior of the user (101) at the third party website may be tracked via a browser cookie, which uses a storage space of the browser to store information about the user (101) at the third party website. Alternatively, or in combination, the third party website uses the server logs to track the activities of the user (101). In one embodiment, the third party website may allow an advertisement network to present advertisements on portions of the web pages. The advertisement network tracks the user's behavior using its server logs and/or browser cookies. For example, the advertisement network may use a browser cookie to identify a particular user across multiple websites. Based on the referral uniform resource locators (URL) that cause the advertisement network to load advertisements in various web pages, the advertisement network can determine the online behavior of the user (101) via analyzing the web pages that the user (101) has visited. Based on the tracked online activities of the user (101), the user data (125) that characterizes the user (101) can be formed to query the profiler selector (129) for a user specific profile (131).
In one embodiment, the cookie identity of the user (101) as tracked using the cookie can be correlated to an account of the user (101), the family of the user (101), the company of the user (101), or other groups that include the user (101) as a member. Thus, the cookie identity can be used as the user data (125) to obtain the user specific profile (131). For example, when the user (101) makes an online purchase from a web page that contains an advertisement that is tracked with the cookie identity, the cookie identity can be correlated to the online transaction and thus to the account of the user (101). For example, when the user (101) visits a web page after authentication of the user (101), and the web page includes an advertisement from the advertisement network, the cookie identity can be correlated to the authenticated identity of the user (101). For example, when the user (101) signs in to a web portal (e.g., 143) of the transaction handler (103) to access the account of the user (101), the cookie identity used by the advertisement network on the web portal (e.g., 143) can be correlated to the account of the user (101).
Other online tracking techniques can also be used to correlate the cookie identity of the user (101) with an identifier of the user (101) known by the profile selector (129), such as a GUID, PAN, account number, customer number, social security number, etc. Subsequently, the cookie identity can be used to select the user specific profile (131).
Multiple Communications
In one embodiment, the entity operating the transaction handler (103) may provide intelligence for providing multiple communications regarding an advertisement. The multiple communications may be directed to two or more points of interaction with the user (101).
For example, after the user (101) is provided with an advertisement via the transaction terminal (105), reminders or revisions to the advertisements can be sent to the user (101) via a separate point of interaction (107), such as a mobile phone, email, text message, etc. For example, the advertisement may include a coupon to offer the user (101) a benefit contingent upon a purchase. If the correlator (117) determines that the coupon has not been redeemed, the correlator (117) may send a message to the mobile phone of the user (101) to remind the user (101) about the offer, and/or revise the offer.
Examples of multiple communications related to an offer in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/510,167, filed Jul. 27, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0022424, and entitled âSuccessive Offer Communications with an Offer Recipient,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Auction Engine
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) provides a portal (e.g., 143) to allow various clients to place bids according to clusters (e.g., to target entities in the clusters for marketing, monitoring, researching, etc.)
For example, cardholders may register in a program to receive offers, such as promotions, discounts, sweepstakes, reward points, direct mail coupons, email coupons, etc. The cardholders may register with issuers, or with the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103). Based on the transaction data (109) or transaction records (301) and/or the registration data, the profile generator (121) is to identify the clusters of cardholders and the values representing the affinity of the cardholders to the clusters. Various entities may place bids according to the clusters and/or the values to gain access to the cardholders, such as the user (101). For example, an issuer may bid on access to offers; an acquirer and/or a merchant may bid on customer segments. An auction engine receives the bids and awards segments and offers based on the received bids. Thus, customers can get great deals; and merchants can get customer traffic and thus sales.
Some techniques to identify a segment of users (101) for marketing are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/288,490, filed Oct. 20, 2008, assigned Pub. No. 2009/0222323, and entitled âOpportunity Segmentation,â U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/108,342, filed Apr. 23, 2008, assigned Pub. No. 2009/0271305, and entitled âPayment Portfolio Optimization,â and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/108,354, filed Apr. 23, 2008, assigned Pub. No. 2009/0271327, and entitled âPayment Portfolio Optimization,â the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Social Network Validation
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) is combined with social network data and/or search engine data to provide benefits (e.g., coupons) to a consumer. For example, a data exchange apparatus may identify cluster data based upon consumer search engine data, social network data, and payment transaction data to identify like groups of individuals who would respond favorably to particular types of benefits such as coupons and statement credits. Advertisement campaigns may be formulated to target the cluster of consumers or cardholders.
In one embodiment, search engine data is combined with social network data and/or the transaction data (109) to evaluate the effectiveness of the advertisements and/or conversion pattern of the advertisements. For example, after a search engine displays advertisements about flat panel televisions to a consumer, a social network that is used by a consumer may provide information about a related purchase made by the consumer. For example, the blog of the consumer, and/or the transaction data (109), may indicate that the flat panel television purchased by the consumer is from company B. Thus, the search engine data, the social network data and/or the transaction data (109) can be combined to correlate advertisements to purchases resulting from the advertisements and to determine the conversion pattern of the advertisement presented to the consumer. Adjustments to advertisements (e.g., placement, appearance, etc.) can be made to improve the effectiveness of the advertisements and thus increase sales.
Loyalty Program
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) uses the account data (111) to store information for third party loyalty programs. The transaction handler (103) processes payment transactions made via financial transaction cards, such as credit cards, debit cards, banking cards, etc.; and the financial transaction cards can be used as loyalty cards for the respective third party loyalty programs. Since the third party loyalty programs are hosted on the transaction handler (103), the consumers do not have to carry multiple, separate loyalty cards (e.g., one for each merchant that offers a loyalty program); and the merchants do not have to incur a large setup and investment fee to establish the loyalty program. The loyalty programs hosted on the transaction handler (103) can provide flexible awards for consumers, retailers, manufacturers, issuers, and other types of business entities involved in the loyalty programs. The integration of the loyalty programs into the accounts of the customers on the transaction handler (103) allows new offerings, such as merchant cross-offerings or bundling of loyalty offerings.
In one embodiment, an entity operating the transaction handler (103) hosts loyalty programs for third parties using the account data (111) of the users (e.g., 101). A third party, such as a merchant, retailer, manufacturer, issuer or other entity that is interested in promoting certain activities and/or behaviors, may offer loyalty rewards on existing accounts of consumers. The incentives delivered by the loyalty programs can drive behavior changes without the hassle of loyalty card creation. In one embodiment, the loyalty programs hosted via the accounts of the users (e.g., 101) of the transaction handler (103) allow the consumers to carry fewer cards and may provide more data to the merchants than traditional loyalty programs.
The loyalty programs integrated with the accounts of the users (e.g., 101) of the transaction handler (103) can provide tools to enable nimble programs that are better aligned for driving changes in consumer behaviors across transaction channels (e.g., online, offline, via mobile devices). The loyalty programs can be ongoing programs that accumulate benefits for customers (e.g., points, miles, cash back), and/or programs that provide one time benefits or limited time benefits (e.g., rewards, discounts, incentives).
 FIG. 8 shows the structure of account data (111) for providing loyalty programs according to one embodiment. In FIG. 8, data related to a third party loyalty program may include an identifier of the loyalty benefit offeror (183) that is linked to a set of loyalty program rules (185) and the loyalty record (187) for the loyalty program activities of the account identifier (181). In one embodiment, at least part of the data related to the third party loyalty program is stored under the account identifier (181) of the user (101), such as the loyalty record (187).
 FIG. 8 illustrates the data related to one third party loyalty program of a loyalty benefit offeror (183). In one embodiment, the account identifier (181) may be linked to multiple loyalty benefit offerors (e.g., 183), corresponding to different third party loyalty programs.
In one embodiment, a third party loyalty program of the loyalty benefit offeror (183) provides the user (101), identified by the account identifier (181), with benefits, such as discounts, rewards, incentives, cash back, gifts, coupons, and/or privileges.
In one embodiment, the association between the account identifier (181) and the loyalty benefit offeror (183) in the account data (111) indicates that the user (101) having the account identifier (181) is a member of the loyalty program. Thus, the user (101) may use the account identifier (181) to access privileges afforded to the members of the loyalty program, such as rights to access a member only area, facility, store, product or service, discounts extended only to members, or opportunities to participate in certain events, buy certain items, or receive certain services reserved for members.
In one embodiment, it is not necessary to make a purchase to use the privileges. The user (101) may enjoy the privileges based on the status of being a member of the loyalty program. The user (101) may use the account identifier (181) to show the status of being a member of the loyalty program.
For example, the user (101) may provide the account identifier (181) (e.g., the account number of a credit card) to the transaction terminal (105) to initiate an authorization process for a special transaction which is designed to check the member status of the user (101), in a manner similar to using the account identifier (181) to initiate an authorization process for a payment transaction. The special transaction is designed to verify the member status of the user (101) via checking whether the account data (111) is associated with the loyalty benefit offeror (183). If the account identifier (181) is associated with the corresponding loyalty benefit offeror (183), the transaction handler (103) provides an approval indication in the authorization process to indicate that the user (101) is a member of the loyalty program. The approval indication can be used as a form of identification to allow the user (101) to access member privileges, such as access to services, products, opportunities, facilities, discounts, permissions, etc., which are reserved for members.
In one embodiment, when the account identifier (181) is used to identify the user (101) as a member to access member privileges, the transaction handler (103) stores information about the access of the corresponding member privilege in loyalty record (187). The profile generator (121) may use the information accumulated in the loyalty record (187) to enhance transaction profiles (127) and provide the user (101) with personalized/targeted advertisements, with or without further offers of benefit (e.g., discounts, incentives, rebates, cash back, rewards, etc.).
In one embodiment, the association of the account identifier (181) and the loyalty benefit offeror (183) also allows the loyalty benefit offeror (183) to access at least a portion of the account data (111) relevant to the loyalty program, such as the loyalty record (187) and certain information about the user (101), such as name, address, and other demographic data.
In one embodiment, the loyalty program allows the user (101) to accumulate benefits according to loyalty program rules (185), such as reward points, cash back, levels of discounts, etc. For example, the user (101) may accumulate reward points for transactions that satisfy the loyalty program rules (185); and the user (101) may redeem the reward points for cash, gifts, discounts, etc. In one embodiment, the loyalty record (187) stores the accumulated benefits; and the transaction handler (103) updates the loyalty record (187) associated with the loyalty benefit offeror (183) and the account identifier (181), when events that satisfy the loyalty program rules (185) occur.
In one embodiment, the accumulated benefits as indicated in the loyalty record (187) can be redeemed when the account identifier (181) is used to perform a payment transaction, when the payment transaction satisfies the loyalty program rules (185). For example, the user (101) may redeem a number of points to offset or reduce an amount of the purchase price.
In one embodiment, when the user (101) uses the account identifier (181) to make purchases as a member, the merchant may further provide information about the purchases; and the transaction handler (103) can store the information about the purchases as part of the loyalty record (187). The information about the purchases may identify specific items or services purchased by the member. For example, the merchant may provide the transaction handler (103) with purchase details at stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, which are then stored as part of the loyalty record (187). The loyalty benefit offeror (183) may use the purchase details to study the purchase behavior of the user (101); and the profile generator (121) may use the SKU level purchase details to enhance the transaction profiles (127).
In one embodiment, the SKU level purchase details are requested from the merchants or retailers via authorization responses, when the account (146) of the user (101) is enrolled in a loyalty program that allows the transaction handler (103) (and/or the issuer processor (145)) to collect the purchase details.
In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) may generate transaction profiles (127) based on the loyalty record (187) and provide the transaction profiles (127) to the loyalty benefit offeror (183) (or other entities when permitted).
In one embodiment, the loyalty benefit offeror (183) may use the transaction profiles (e.g., 127 or 131) to select candidates for membership offering. For example, the loyalty program rules (185) may include one or more criteria that can be used to identify which customers are eligible for the loyalty program. The transaction handler (103) may be configured to automatically provide the qualified customers with an offer of membership in the loyalty program when the corresponding customers are performing transactions via the transaction handler (103) and/or via points of interaction (107) accessible to the entity operating the transaction handler (103), such as ATMs, mobile phones, receipts, statements, websites, etc. The user (101) may accept the membership offer via responding to the advertisement. For example, the user (101) may load the membership into the account in the same way as loading a coupon into the account of the user (101).
In one embodiment, the membership offer is provided as a coupon or is associated with another offer of benefits, such as a discount, reward, etc. When the coupon or benefit is redeemed via the transaction handler (103), the account data (111) is updated to enroll the user (101) into the corresponding loyalty program.
In one embodiment, a merchant may enroll a user (101) into a loyalty program when the user (101) is making a purchase at the transaction terminal (105) of the merchant.
For example, when the user (101) is making a transaction at an ATM, performing a self-assisted check out on a POS terminal, or making a purchase transaction on a mobile phone or a computer, the user (101) may be prompted to join a loyalty program, while the transaction is being authorized by the transaction handler (103). If the user (101) accepts the membership offer, the account data (111) is updated to have the account identifier (181) associated with the loyalty benefit offeror (183).
In one embodiment, the user (101) may be automatically enrolled in the loyalty program, when the profile of the user (101) satisfies a set of conditions specified in the loyalty program rules (185). The user (101) may opt out of the loyalty program.
In one embodiment, the loyalty benefit offeror (183) may personalize and/or target loyalty benefits based on the transaction profile (131) specific to or linked to the user (101). For example, the loyalty program rules (185) may use the user specific profile (131) to select gifts, rewards, or incentives for the user (101) (e.g., to redeem benefits, such as reward points, accumulated in the loyalty record (187)). The user specific profile (131) may be enhanced using the loyalty record (187), or generated based on the loyalty record (187). For example, the profile generator (121) may use a subset of transaction data (109) associated with the loyalty record (187) to generate the user specific profile (131), or provide more weight to the subset of the transaction data (109) associated with the loyalty record (187) while also using other portions of the transaction data (109) in deriving the user specific profile (131).
In one embodiment, the loyalty program may involve different entities. For example, a first merchant may offer rewards as discounts, or gifts from a second merchant that has a business relationship with the first merchant. For example, an entity may allow a user (101) to accumulate loyalty benefits (e.g., reward points) via purchase transactions at a group of different merchants. For example, a group of merchants may jointly offer a loyalty program, in which loyalty benefits (e.g., reward points) can be accumulated from purchases at any of the merchants in the group and redeemable in purchases at any of the merchants.
In one embodiment, the information identifying the user (101) as a member of a loyalty program is stored on a server connected to the transaction handler (103). Alternatively or in combination, the information identifying the user (101) as a member of a loyalty program can also be stored in a financial transaction card (e.g., in the chip, or in the magnetic strip).
In one embodiment, loyalty program offerors (e.g., merchants, manufactures, issuers, retailers, clubs, organizations, etc.) can compete with each other in making loyalty program related offers. For example, loyalty program offerors may place bids on loyalty program related offers; and the advertisement selector (133) (e.g., under the control of the entity operating the transaction handler (103), or a different entity) may prioritize the offers based on the bids. When the offers are accepted or redeemed by the user (101), the loyalty program offerors pay fees according to the corresponding bids. In one embodiment, the loyalty program offerors may place an auto bid or maximum bid, which specifies the upper limit of a bid; and the actual bid is determined to be the lowest possible bid that is larger than the bids of the competitors, without exceeding the upper limit.
In one embodiment, the offers are provided to the user (101) in response to the user (101) being identified by the user data (125). If the user specific profile (131) satisfies the conditions specified in the loyalty program rules (185), the offer from the loyalty benefit offeror (183) can be presented to the user (101). When there are multiple offers from different offerors, the offers can be prioritized according to the bids.
In one embodiment, the offerors can place bids based on the characteristics that can be used as the user data (125) to select the user specific profile (131). In another embodiment, the bids can be placed on a set of transaction profiles (127).
In one embodiment, the loyalty program based offers are provided to the user (101) just in time when the user (101) can accept and redeem the offers. For example, when the user (101) is making a payment for a purchase from a merchant, an offer to enroll in a loyalty program offered by the merchant or related offerors can be presented to the user (101). If the user (101) accepts the offer, the user (101) is entitled to receive member discounts for the purchase.
For example, when the user (101) is making a payment for a purchase from a merchant, a reward offer can be provided to the user (101) based on loyalty program rules (185) and the loyalty record (187) associated with the account identifier (181) of the user (101)(e.g., the reward points accumulated in a loyalty program). Thus, the user effort for redeeming the reward points can be reduced; and the user experience can be improved.
In one embodiment, a method to provide loyalty programs includes the use of a computing apparatus of a transaction handler (103). The computing apparatus processes a plurality of payment card transactions. After the computing apparatus receives a request to track transactions for a loyalty program, such as the loyalty program rules (185), the computing apparatus stores and updates loyalty program information in response to transactions occurring in the loyalty program. The computing apparatus provides to a customer (e.g., 101) an offer of a benefit when the customer satisfies a condition defined in the loyalty program, such as the loyalty program rules (185).
Examples of loyalty programs offered through collaboration between collaborative constituents in a payment processing system, including the transaction handler (103) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/767,202, filed Jun. 22, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0059302, and entitled âLoyalty Program Service,â U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/848,112, filed Aug. 30, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0059306, and entitled âLoyalty Program Incentive Determination,â and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/848,179, filed Aug. 30, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0059307, and entitled âLoyalty Program Parameter Collaboration,â the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Examples of processing the redemption of accumulated loyalty benefits via the transaction handler (103) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/835,100, filed Aug. 7, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0059303, and entitled âTransaction Evaluation for Providing Rewards,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the incentive, reward, or benefit provided in the loyalty program is based on the presence of correlated related transactions. For example, in one embodiment, an incentive is provided if a financial payment card is used in a reservation system to make a reservation and the financial payment card is subsequently used to pay for the reserved good or service. Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/945,907, filed Nov. 27, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0071587, and entitled âIncentive Wireless Communication Reservation,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) provides centralized loyalty program management, reporting and membership services. In one embodiment, membership data is downloaded from the transaction handler (103) to acceptance point devices, such as the transaction terminal (105). In one embodiment, loyalty transactions are reported from the acceptance point devices to the transaction handler (103); and the data indicating the loyalty points, rewards, benefits, etc. are stored on the account identification device (141). Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/401,504, filed Mar. 27, 2003, assigned Pub. No. 2004/0054581, and entitled âNetwork Centric Loyalty System,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) is used to manage reward or loyalty programs for entities such as issuers, merchants, etc. The cardholders, such as the user (101), are rewarded with offers/benefits from merchants. The portal (143) and/or the transaction handler (103) track the transaction records for the merchants for the reward or loyalty programs. Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/688,423, filed Mar. 20, 2007, assigned Pub. No. 2008/0195473, and entitled âReward Program Manager,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, a loyalty program includes multiple entities providing access to detailed transaction data, which allows the flexibility for the customization of the loyalty program. For example, issuers or merchants may sponsor the loyalty program to provide rewards; and the portal (143) and/or the transaction handler (103) stores the loyalty currency in the data warehouse (149). Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/177,530, filed Jul. 22, 2008, assigned Pub. No. 2009/0030793, and entitled âMulti-Vender Multi-Loyalty Currency Program,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, an incentive program is created on the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103). The portal (143) collects offers from a plurality of merchants and stores the offers in the data warehouse (149). The offers may have associated criteria for their distributions. The portal (143) and/or the transaction handler (103) may recommend offers based on the transaction data (109). In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) automatically applies the benefits of the offers during the processing of the transactions when the transactions satisfy the conditions associated with the offers. In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) communicates with transaction terminals (e.g., 105) to set up, customize, and/or update offers based on market focus, product categories, service categories, targeted consumer demographics, etc. Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/413,097, filed Mar. 27, 2009, assigned Pub. No. 2010-0049620, and entitled âMerchant Device Support of an Integrated Offer Network,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is configured to provide offers from merchants to the user (101) via the payment system, making accessing and redeeming the offers convenient for the user (101). The offers may be triggered by and/or tailored to a previous transaction, and may be valid only for a limited period of time starting from the date of the previous transaction. If the transaction handler (103) determines that a subsequent transaction processed by the transaction handler (103) meets the conditions for the redemption of an offer, the transaction handler (103) may credit the consumer account (146) for the redemption of the offer and/or provide a notification message to the user (101). Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/566,350, filed Sep. 24, 2009, assigned Pub. No. 2010/0114686, and entitled âReal-Time Statement Credits and Notifications,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Details on loyalty programs in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/896,632, filed Oct. 1, 2010, assigned Pub. No. 2011/0087530, and entitled âSystems and Methods to Provide Loyalty Programs,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
SKU
In one embodiment, merchants generate stock-keeping unit (SKU) or other specific information that identifies the particular goods and services purchased by the user (101) or customer. The SKU information may be provided to the operator of the transaction handler (103) that processed the purchases. The operator of the transaction handler (103) may store the SKU information as part of transaction data (109), and reflect the SKU information for a particular transaction in a transaction profile (127 or 131) associated with the person involved in the transaction.
When a user (101) shops at a traditional retail store or browses a website of an online merchant, an SKU-level profile associated specifically with the user (101) may be provided to select an advertisement appropriately targeted to the user (101) (e.g., via mobile phones, POS terminals, web browsers, etc.). The SKU-level profile for the user (101) may include an identification of the goods and services historically purchased by the user (101). In addition, the SKU-level profile for the user (101) may identify goods and services that the user (101) may purchase in the future. The identification may be based on historical purchases reflected in SKU-level profiles of other individuals or groups that are determined to be similar to the user (101). Accordingly, the return on investment for advertisers and merchants can be greatly improved.
In one embodiment, the user specific profile (131) is an aggregated spending profile (341) that is generated using the SKU-level information. For example, in one embodiment, the factor values (344) correspond to factor definitions (331) that are generated based on aggregating spending in different categories of products and/or services. A typical merchant offers products and/or services in many different categories.
In one embodiment, the user (101) may enter into transactions with various online and âbrick and mortarâ merchants. The transactions may involve the purchase of various goods and services. The goods and services may be identified by SKU numbers or other information that specifically identifies the goods and services purchased by the user (101).
In one embodiment, the merchant may provide the SKU information regarding the goods and services purchased by the user (101) (e.g., purchase details at SKU level) to the operator of the transaction handler (103). In one embodiment, the SKU information may be provided to the operator of the transaction handler (103) in connection with a loyalty program, as described in more detail below. The SKU information may be stored as part of the transaction data (109) and associated with the user (101). In one embodiment, the SKU information for items purchased in transactions facilitated by the operator of the transaction handler (103) may be stored as transaction data (109) and associated with its associated purchaser. In one embodiment, the SKU level purchase details are requested from the merchants or retailers via authorization responses, when the account (146) of the user (101) is enrolled in a program that allows the transaction handler (103) (and/or the issuer processor (145)) to collect the purchase details.
In one embodiment, based on the SKU information and perhaps other transaction data, the profile generator (121) may create an SKU-level transaction profile for the user (101). In one embodiment, based on the SKU information associated with the transactions for each person entering into transactions with the operator of the transaction handler (103), the profile generator (121) may create an SKU-level transaction profile for each person.
In one embodiment, the SKU information associated with a group of purchasers may be aggregated to create an SKU-level transaction profile that is descriptive of the group. The group may be defined based on one or a variety of considerations. For example, the group may be defined by common demographic features of its members. As another example, the group may be defined by common purchasing patters of its members.
In one embodiment, the user (101) may later consider the purchase of additional goods and services. The user (101) may shop at a traditional retailer or an online retailer. With respect to an online retailer, for example, the user (101) may browse the website of an online retailer, publisher, or merchant. The user (101) may be associated with a browser cookie to, for example, identify the user (101) and track the browsing behavior of the user (101).
In one embodiment, the retailer may provide the browser cookie associated with the user (101) to the operator of the transaction handler (103). Based on the browser cookie, the operator of the transaction handler (103) may associate the browser cookie with a personal account number of the user (101). The association may be performed by the operator of the transaction handler (103) or another entity in a variety of manners such as, for example, using a look up table.
Based on the personal account number, the profile selector (129) may select a user specific profile (131) that constitutes the SKU-level profile associated specifically with the user (101). The SKU-level profile may reflect the individual, prior purchases of the user (101) specifically, and/or the types of goods and services that the user (101) has purchased.
The SKU-level profile for the user (101) may also include identifications of goods and services the user (101) may purchase in the future. In one embodiment, the identifications may be used for the selection of advertisements for goods and services that may be of interest to the user (101). In one embodiment, the identifications for the user (101) may be based on the SKU-level information associated with historical purchases of the user (101). In one embodiment, the identifications for the user (101) may be additionally or alternatively based on transaction profiles associated with others. The recommendations may be determined by predictive association and other analytical techniques.
For example, the identifications for the user (101) may be based on the transaction profile of another person. The profile selector (129) may apply predetermined criteria to identify another person who, to a predetermined degree, is deemed sufficiently similar to the user (101). The identification of the other person may be based on a variety of factors including, for example, demographic similarity and/or purchasing pattern similarity between the user (101) and the other person. As one example, the common purchase of identical items or related items by the user (101) and the other person may result in an association between the user (101) and the other person, and a resulting determination that the user (101) and the other person are similar. Once the other person is identified, the transaction profile constituting the SKU-level profile for the other person may be analyzed. Through predictive association and other modeling and analytical techniques, the historical purchases reflected in the SKU-level profile for the other person may be employed to predict the future purchases of the user (101).
As another example, the identifications of the user (101) may be based on the transaction profiles of a group of persons. The profile selector (129) may apply predetermined criteria to identify a multitude of persons who, to a predetermined degree, are deemed sufficiently similar to the user (101). The identification of the other persons may be based on a variety of factors including, for example, demographic similarity and/or purchasing pattern similarity between the user (101) and the other persons. Once the group constituting the other persons is identified, the transaction profile constituting the SKU-level profile for the group may be analyzed. Through predictive association and other modeling and analytical techniques, the historical purchases reflected in the SKU-level profile for the group may be employed to predict the future purchases of the user (101).
The SKU-level profile of the user (101) may be provided to select an advertisement that is appropriately targeted. Because the SKU-level profile of the user (101) may include identifications of the goods and services that the user (101) may be likely to buy, advertisements corresponding to the identified goods and services may be presented to the user (101). In this way, targeted advertising for the user (101) may be optimized. Further, advertisers and publishers of advertisements may improve their return on investment, and may improve their ability to cross-sell goods and services.
In one embodiment, SKU-level profiles of others who are identified to be similar to the user (101) may be used to identify a user (101) who may exhibit a high propensity to purchase goods and services. For example, if the SKU-level profiles of others reflect a quantity or frequency of purchase that is determined to satisfy a threshold, then the user (101) may also be classified or predicted to exhibit a high propensity to purchase. Accordingly, the type and frequency of advertisements that account for such propensity may be appropriately tailored for the user (101).
In one embodiment, the SKU-level profile of the user (101) may reflect transactions with a particular merchant or merchants. The SKU-level profile of the user (101) may be provided to a business that is considered a peer with or similar to the particular merchant or merchants. For example, a merchant may be considered a peer of the business because the merchant offers goods and services that are similar to or related to those of the business. The SKU-level profile reflecting transactions with peer merchants may be used by the business to better predict the purchasing behavior of the user (101) and to optimize the presentation of targeted advertisements to the user (101).
Details on SKU-level profile in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/899,144, filed Oct. 6, 2010, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0093335 and entitled âSystems and Methods for Advertising Services Based on an SKU-Level Profile,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Real-Time Messages
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is configured to cooperate with the media controller (115) to facilitate real-time interaction with the user (101) when the payment of the user (101) is being processed by the transaction handler (103). The real-time interaction provides the opportunity to impact the user experience during the purchase (e.g., at the time of card swipe), through delivering messages in real-time to a point of interaction (107), such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a portable computer, etc. The real-time message can be delivered via short message service (SMS), email, instant messaging, or other communications protocols.
In one embodiment, the real-time message is provided without requiring modifications to existing systems used by the merchants and/or issuers.
 FIG. 9 shows a system to provide real-time messages according to one embodiment. In FIG. 9, the transaction handler (103) (or a separate computing system coupled with the transaction handler (103)) is to detect the occurrence of certain transactions of interest during the processing of the authorization requests received from the transaction terminal (105); a message broker (201) is to identify a relevant message for the user (101) associated with the corresponding authorization request; and the media controller (115) is to provide the message to the user (101) at the point of interaction (107) via a communication channel separate from the channel used by the transaction handler (103) to respond to the corresponding authorization request submitted from the transaction terminal (105).
In one embodiment, the media controller (115) is to provide the message to the point of interaction (107) in parallel with the transaction handler (103) providing the response to the authorization request.
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) receives the message from the media controller (115) in real-time with the transaction handler (103) processing the authorization request. In one embodiment, the message is to arrive at the point of interaction (107) in the context of the response provided from the transaction handler (103) to the transaction terminal (105). For example, the message is to arrive at the point of interaction (107) substantially at the same time as the response to the authorization request arrives at the transaction terminal (105), or with a delay not long enough to cause the user (101) to have the impression that the message is in response to an action other than the payment transaction. For example, the message is to arrive at the point of interaction (107) prior to the user (101) completing the transaction and leaving the transaction terminal (105), or prior to the user (101) leaving the retail location of the merchant operating the transaction terminal (105).
In FIG. 9, the system includes a portal (143) to provide services to merchants and/or the user (101).
For example, in one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the user (101) to register the communication reference (205) in association with the account data (111), such as the account information (142) of the consumer account (146); and the media controller (115) is to use the communication reference (205) to deliver the message to the point of interaction (107). Examples of the communication reference (205) include a mobile phone number, an email address, a user identifier of an instant messaging system, an IP address, etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows merchants and/or other parties to define rules (203) to provide offers (186) as real-time responses to authorization requests; and based on the offer rules (203), the message broker (201) is to generate, or instruct the media controller (115) to generate, the real-time message to provide the offers (186) to the user (101). For example, the offer (186) may include a discount, incentive, reward, rebate, gift, or other benefit, which can be redeemed upon the satisfaction of certain conditions required by the offer rules (203). In one embodiment, based on the offer rules (203) the message broker (201) configures a message by selecting the appropriate message template from (an) existing message(s) template(s), and inserts any relevant data (e.g., the communication reference (205)) into the selected template, then passes the configured message to the media controller (115), which delivers the message to the point of interaction (107). In one embodiment, the message broker (201) (or a subsystem) is used to manage message templates along with the rules for selecting the appropriate message template from among several potential choices.
In one embodiment, the offer rules (203) include offer details, targeting rules, advertisement campaign details, profile mapping, creative mapping, qualification rules, award/notify/fulfillment rules, approvals, etc. Creative elements for offers include text, images, channels, approvals, etc.
In one embodiment, when the offer rules (203) are activated by the merchant or advertiser via the portal (143), the message broker (201) is to generate trigger records (207) for the transaction handler (103). The transaction handler (103) is to monitor the incoming authorization requests to identify requests that satisfy the conditions specified in the trigger records (207) during the process of the authorization requests, and to provide the information about the identified requests to the message broker (201) for the transmission of an appropriate real-time message in accordance with the offer rules (203).
In one embodiment, the generation of the trigger records (207) for the transaction handler (103) is in real-time with the merchant or advertiser activating the offer rules (203). Thus, the offer rules (203) can be activated and used for the detection of the new authorization requests in real-time, while the transaction handler (103) continues to process the incoming authorization requests.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides information about the spending behaviors reflected in the transaction data (109) to assist the merchants or advertisers to target offers or advertisements. For example, in one embodiment, the portal (143) allows merchants to target the offers (186) based on transaction profiles (127). For example, the offer rules (203) are partially based on the values in a transaction profile (127), such as an aggregated spending profile (341). In one embodiment, the offer rules (203) are partially based on the information about the last purchase of the user (101) from the merchant operating the transaction terminal (105) (or another merchant), and/or the information about the location of the user (101), such as the location determined based on the location of the transaction terminal (105) and/or the location of the merchant operating the transaction terminal (105).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides transaction based statistics, such as merchant benchmarking statistics, industry/market segmentation, etc., to assist merchants and advertisers to identify customers.
Thus, the real-time messages can be used to influence customer behaviors while the customers are in the purchase mode.
In one embodiment, the benefit of the offers (186) can be redeemed via the transaction handler (103). The redemption of the offer (186) may or may not require the purchase details (e.g., SKU level purchase details). Details in one embodiment about redeeming offers (186) via the transaction handler (103) are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/113,710, filed May 23, 2011 and entitled âSystems and Methods for Redemption of Offers,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, when the authorization request for a purchase indicates that the purchase qualifies the offer (186) for redemption if the purchase corresponding to the authorization request is completed, the message broker (201) is to construct a message and use the media controller (115) to deliver the message in real-time with the processing of the authorization request to the point of interaction (107). The message informs the user (101) that when the purchase is completed, the transaction handler (103) and/or the issuer processor (145) is to provide the benefit of the offer (186) to the user (101) via statement credit or some other settlement value, for example points in a registered loyalty program, or credit at the point of sale using a digital coupon delivered to the purchaser via mobile phone.
In one embodiment, the settlement of the payment transaction corresponding to the authorization request does not occur in real-time with the processing of the authorization request. For example, the merchant may submit the complete purchases for settlement at the end of the day, or in accordance with a predetermined schedule. The settlement may occur one or more days after the processing of the authorization request.
In one embodiment, when transactions are settled, the settled transactions are matched to the authorization requests to identify offers (186) that are redeemable in view of the settlement. When the offer (186) is confirmed to be redeemable based on a record of successful settlement, the message broker (201) is to use the media controller (115) to provide a message to the point of interaction (107) of the user (101), such as the mobile phone of the user (101). In one embodiment, the message is to inform the user (101) of the benefit to be provided as statement credits and/or to provide additional offers. In one embodiment, the message to confirm the statement credits is transmitted in real-time with the completion of the transaction settlement.
In one embodiment, the message broker (201) is to determine the identity of the merchant based on the information included in the authorization request transmitted from the transaction terminal (105) to the transaction handler (103). In one embodiment, the identity of the merchant is normalized to allow the application of the offer rules (203) that are merchant specific.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to provide data insight to merchants and/or advertisers. For example, the portal (143) can provide the transaction profile (127) of the user (101), audience segmentation information, etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to allow the merchants and/or advertisers to define and manage offers (186) for their creation, fulfillment and/or delivery in messages.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the merchants and/or advertisers to test, run and/or monitor the offers (186) for their creation, fulfillment and/or delivery in messages.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to provide reports and analytics regarding the offers (186).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides operation facilities, such as onboarding, contact management, certification, file management, workflow assistance, etc. to assist the merchants and/or advertisers to complete the tasks related to the offers (186).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the user (101) to opt in or opt out of the real-time message delivery service.
In one embodiment, an advertiser or merchant can select an offer fulfillment method from a list of options, such as statement credits, points, gift cards, e-certificates, third party fulfillment, etc.
In one embodiment, the merchant or advertiser is to use the âoff the rackâ transaction profiles (127) available in the data warehouse (149). In one embodiment, the merchant or advertiser can further edit parameters to customize the generation of the transaction profiles (127) and/or develop custom transaction profiles from scratch using the portal (143).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides a visualization tool to allow the user to see clusters of data based on GeoCodes, proximity, transaction volumes, spending patterns, zip codes, customers, stores, etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the merchant or advertiser to define cells for targeting the customers in the cells based on date/time, profile attributes, map to offer/channel/creative, condition testing, etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the merchant or advertiser to monitor the system health, such as the condition of servers, files received or sent, errors, status, etc., the throughput by date or range, by program, by campaign, or by global view, and aspects of current programs/offers/campaigns, such as offer details, package audit reports, etc. In one embodiment, reporting includes analytics and metrics, such as lift, conversion, category differentials (e.g., spending patterns, transaction volumes, peer groups), and reporting by program, campaign, cell, GeoCode, proximity, ad-hoc, auditing, etc.
 FIG. 10 shows a method to provide real-time messages according to one embodiment. In FIG. 10, a computing apparatus is to generate (211) a trigger record (207) for a transaction handler (103) to identify an authorization request that satisfies the conditions specified in the trigger record (207), receive (213) from the transaction handler (103) information about the authorization request in real-time with the transaction handler (103) providing a response to the authorization request to a transaction terminal (105), identify (215) a communication reference (205) of a user (101) associated with the authorization request, determine (217) a message for the user (101) responsive to the authorization request, and provide (219) the message to the user (101) at a point of interaction (107) via the communication reference (205), in parallel with the response from the transaction handler (103) to the transaction terminal (105).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus includes at least one of: a transaction handler (103), a message broker (201), a media controller (115), a portal (143) and a data warehouse (149).
Trigger Rank
 FIG. 11 shows a system to arrange the delivery of real-time messages according to one embodiment. In FIG. 11, the portal (143) is configured to provide a marketer (241) with a user interface to set up a message campaign related to an offer (186), such as a message campaign to provide the offer (186) to users (e.g., 101) under certain conditions, to modify the offer (186) under other conditions, and to provide reminders of the offer (186) under further conditions.
In one embodiment, the messages transmitted in the message campaign are in response to transactions made by the respective users (e.g., 101) and in response to the respective transactions being processed by the transaction handler (103). In one embodiment, the messages are transmitted to the users (e.g., 101) in real time and/or in parallel with the processing and transmitting of the authorization responses for the respective transactions.
In one embodiment, the data warehouse (149) is configured to store trigger records (207), each of which specifies a set of conditions that a transaction needs to meet to trigger an action by the message broker (201). The transaction handler (103) is configured to monitor the transactions processed at the transaction handler (103) to detect transactions that satisfy the trigger records (207); and in response to the transaction handler (103) detecting a transaction that satisfies the conditions specified in a trigger record (207), the transaction handler (103) is configured to cause the message broker (201) to generate and transmit a message in accordance with the respective trigger record (207). The message may provide the offer (186), modify the offer (186), reminder the user (101) of the offer (186), etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) of the real-time messaging system illustrated in FIG. 11 provides marketers with user interfaces to set up âtriggersâ corresponding to the trigger records (207). For example, a trigger may correspond to the condition of âspending $X at Y Merchant by an enrollee;â and an action may be associated with the trigger to provide an offer (e.g., 186) to the corresponding enrollee.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to help marketers set up triggers for their messages, advertisements and/or offers, through automatically ranking triggers, selecting valuable and/or effective triggers, and/or filtering out ineffective triggers.
In general, there would be thousands of potential triggers that could be used for targeting offers or advertisements. However, there might be only a smaller number of triggers that are valuable and/or effective in causing desired actions of the enrollees, such as making purchases according to the advertisements or taking advantage of the benefit of the offers. In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to rank the triggers according to their potential to increase revenue via the offer (e.g., 186) delivered via the respective triggers.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows a marketer to log in and specify offers (186) and rules or triggers for the delivery of the offers (186) and/or messages related to the offers (186), such as reminders, notifications, modifications, etc.
For example, in one embodiment, the portal (143) provides a user interface to receive from the marketer (241) inputs to define the offer (186), user segment identification (243) that includes characteristics used to identify a set of users (101) to be targeted with the offer (186), and trigger identification (245) that specifies the trigger conditions for each message that is related to the offer (186) and scheduled to be transmitted to the respective users (101) in response to transactions satisfying the trigger conditions.
Once the offers and triggers are specified in a self-service way using the portal (143), the system as illustrated in FIG. 11 is configured to deliver the messages containing the offers (186) and/or related to the offers (186) according to the input specified by the marketer (241) in the portal (143).
In one embodiment, the system is configured to further monitor performance of the offers/messages delivered via the triggers, via identifying the purchases that use the offers (and thus close the loop between the offer presented via the real-time messages and the purchases that may occur out of the context of the real-time messages, such as offline purchases).
Examples and details regarding closing the loop, in one embodiment, between the offers presented and the respective purchases resulting from the offers are provided in the section entitled âCLOSE THE LOOP.â
In one embodiment, the data warehouse (149) stores data indicating the trigger performance (251), based on correlating the messages transmitted via predefined triggers (249) and the responses by the user (101) receiving the messages triggered by the respective predefined triggers. The trigger performance (251) is indicative of how likely a user (101) is to respond to a message if the message is received by the user (101) via the respective predefined trigger (249).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the marketer (241) to identify a targeting objective and obtain a report of ranked and/or suggested triggers (247) that can be effective for the targeting objective. Such a report helps the marketer (241) select triggers for the targeting objective.
For example, in one embodiment, the marketer (241) may identify the targeting objective as providing offers (186) to a set of enrollees to cause the enrollees to take advantage of the benefit of the offers (186) by making the purchases required for the fulfillment of the offers (186). The set of enrollees can be specified via a set of conditions for filtering enrollees. For example, a marketer for Marriott hotels may identify the business objective of reaching a subset of enrollees, who are frequent travelers and who spend more than $1000 a year on hotels. Other examples of enrollee sets include: âlow share of wallet customers for GAP,â âlapsed customers for Olive Garden,â etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides a set of filters (e.g., user segment identification (243)) that can be applied by the marketer (241) to identify the target set of users (101). In one embodiment, some of the filters are based on the identification of the user segment or cluster, the date or time period of the spending, the merchant geography or location of the spending, distance to merchant, correlated spending, spending amount or type, user history, and/or user attributes such as values (342-347) in aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341), addresses, account statuses (e.g., lapsed, lost, new, regular), etc.
In one embodiment, after the target set of users (101) is identified via applying one or more filters and selectors, the portal (143) is configured to use the transaction data (109) to rank possible triggers for the delivery of offers (186) to the target set of users (101). Some of the triggers may be predefined; some of the triggers may be identified by the portal (143) automatically based on a database of available parameters and rules for automated construction of triggers; and some of the triggers may be customized by the marketer (241).
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) and/or past responses to similar offers are used to predict the effectiveness of the offers delivered in accordance with the respective triggers; and the triggers are sorted or ranked according to the predicted effectiveness of the respective triggers.
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) of the users (101) targeted by the user segment identification (243) is used to determine the likelihood of the users (101) performing transactions that would satisfy the conditions of the respective triggers. Based on the past transaction histories of the users (101) identified by the user segment identification (243), the portal (143) is configured to determine the probability and frequencies of the users (101) performing transactions that satisfy the triggers identified by the trigger identification (245) and the average amounts of the transactions that satisfy the respective triggers. The probabilities, the frequencies and/or the averages are used to rank the triggers (e.g., based on the expected revenue impact on the messages transmitted in accordance with the respective triggers). In one embodiment, the trigger performance (251) is also used in determining the expected revenue impact on the messages transmitted in accordance with the respective triggers.
In one embodiment, the marketer (241) may specify the target set of users (101) via the desired purchase type. For example, the marketer for Marriott hotels may identify that the goal of the offers (186) is to drive purchases for hotel stays. The portal (143) is configured to perform an analysis to identify variables or factors that can be used to specify the target set of users (101) that is likely to take the offers (186). For example, the portal (143) is configured to determine, based on the transaction data (109), that airline purchases correlate to hotel stays. Thus, the marketer for Marriott hotels may use variables or factors related to airline purchases to identify the target set of users (101). In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to provide a report of ranked parameters, factors, or purchases based on their correlation to the desired purchase type indicated by the marketer (241) (or identified based on the offer specified by the marketer (241)).
In one embodiment, once the marketer (241) specifies the desired purchase type, the portal (143) is configured to automatically determine a target set of users (101), based on the spending patterns reflected in the transaction data (109). For example, the portal (143) is configured to perform a cluster analysis and/or a factor analysis to identify the parameters to define the target set of users (101). In one embodiment, the set of parameters is presented to the marketer (241) to allow modifications and/or customization, based on the personal knowledge of the marketer (241).
In one embodiment, the target set of users (101) is specified based on the factor values of spending profiles (e.g., 341) of the respective users. Alternatively or in combination, other variables, such as marketer-defined variables based on certain predefined variables provided in the system, can be used to define the target set of users (101).
Since the portal (143) identifies the variables or factors relevant to the desired transactions based on correlation relationships in the transaction data (109), the portal (143) can discover variables or factors that are non-obvious to typical marketers and eliminate variables or factors that might be incorrectly perceived to have strong correlation with the desired transactions. Thus, the marketer (241) can use the variables or factors to more effectively specify the target set of users (101).
In one embodiment, based on the transaction data (109) of the target set of users (101), the portal (143) is configured to provide a report showing a ranked list of possible triggers (247) that might be used to reach the target set of users (101). In one embodiment, based on the desired transactions, the portal (143) is configured to automatically identify the target set of users (101) and then identify the ranked list of possible triggers (247).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to rank the triggers (247) based on the probability of transactions satisfying a corresponding trigger, anticipated number of trigger events, and anticipated spending caused by the advertisement. For example, in one embodiment, trigger ranking is based on a ranking parameter determined via computing the probability of a trigger occurring on the same day (or within a range of hours in the same day) as spending at the target merchant by enrollees (or accounts similar to enrollees if the data is sparse) within a given time period, and multiplying the probability by the number of trigger events anticipated (or the correlated spending at the target merchant). Such a ranking parameter allows the sorting of possible triggers (e.g., in a descending order). Thus, the marketer (241) could look at the ranked triggers (247) that appear to have the highest potential to boost incremental revenue first. In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to estimate the performance levels of the triggers (247) based on transaction data (109) and rank the triggers (247) based on the estimated performance levels. The subsequent purchases generated from the offers (186) provided according to the triggers (247) can be used to improve the estimates and/or to determine the actual performance level of the triggers (247). In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to automatically select the top ranking triggers (247) and adjust the selections based on the actual performance of the selected triggers (247).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides an auto-trigger option. When the auto-trigger option is selected, the portal (143) is configured to automatically identify, from the transaction data (109), the purchase events that occur around the time that target merchant purchases occur and automatically generate triggers based on the identified purchase events. Thus, the marketer (241) does not need to guess what the triggers might be or run a large number of reports to develop their knowledge.
In one embodiment, the message broker (201) is configured to use selected enrollees' past behavior to find key factors and weights to decide whether an eligible enrollee should be provided with an offer (186) (or anything else). In one embodiment, an analysis to determine the factors/parameters and weights is performed on an individual enrollee basis to allow customized targeting.
For example, a representative of a merchant (e.g., GAP) identifies to the portal (143) the desire to target enrollees who are âhigh retail clothing spendersâ as a business objective to drive purchases with a âspend $100 get $25 offâ offer. Without much time to do precise targeting, the representative can select an âAuto-Targetâ operation in the self-service portal (143) for offer campaign management. In one embodiment, the representative of the merchant defines the âhigh retail clothing spendersâ as enrollees who are in the top 2 deciles for a predetermined spending model named âRetail Clothing Generic Model.â The representative of the merchant uses the portal (143) to set up the offer parameters and submit the request to start the offer campaign. A high retail clothing spender enrolls in the service of the system illustrated in FIG. 11 via an enrollment page (e.g., via GAP's website, the issuer's website, or the portal (143)) and gives permission to be marketed to by the system. Since the enrollee is in the top 2 deciles, a set of factors and weights customized based on the transaction data of the enrollee is created and loaded for the trigger. The system also automatically selects the time window for correlated purchases (like âwithin 1 dayâ or even âwithin 3 hoursâ). If the enrollee makes a triggering purchase at a merchant correlated with spending at the target merchant by the enrollee (e.g., they performed this sequence before) (and if the enrollee has not been flagged as a control group member), an offer is sent via SMS with a purchase code that can be entered into the point of sale (POS) system at any store of the merchant to claim the benefit of the offer (186). The enrollee may or may not respond to the offer (186) by making a purchase to take advantage of the offer (186). The system tracks the purchases that result from the offers (186); and the representative of the merchant can use the portal (143) to obtain an offer performance report to see how the offer (186) performed.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) allows the representative of the merchant to specify selection/targeting criteria for the portal (143) to select a subset of enrollees; and the portal (143) is configured to run the offer campaign, without revealing the identity of the targeted enrollees to the merchant before the enrollees take advantage of the offers (186).
In one embodiment, when in the auto-trigger mode, the system is configured to rank triggers in a way similar to ranking the triggers to generate the report for the marketer (241). In one embodiment, the marketer (241) may specify a few parameters, such as answers to questions like âWhat time of day are you targeting?â âDoes correlated spending mean spending in the same day?â etc. in combination with the auto-trigger selection. Based on the options selected by the marketer (241) and the ranking of relevant triggers, the system is configured to generate a set of top ranking triggers (247) to schedule the delivery of offers (186) on behalf of the marketer (241).
In one embodiment, the system can inject a ârandomâ group into the list of eligible users to measure the benefit of using the Auto-Target mode.
 FIG. 12 shows a method to arrange the delivery of real-time messages according to one embodiment. In FIG. 12, a computing apparatus is configured to receive (221) an input specifying an advertisement (e.g., offer (186)), identify (223) a target set of users (e.g., 101), identify (225) a set of triggers for delivery of the advertisement to the target set of users (e.g., 101), rank (227) the triggers based at least in part on transaction data (109) of the target set of users (e.g., 101) to generate a ranked list of the triggers (247), identify (229) one or more selected triggers (247) based on the ranked list, monitor (231) transactions at a transaction handler (103) according to the one or more selected triggers (247), and transmit (233) the advertisement to a user (101) in the target set in response to a transaction of the user (101) being processed at the transaction handler (103) matching the requirements of a selected trigger (247).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to identify the target set of users (e.g., 101) based on the user segment identification (243) specified by the marketer (241). For example, the user segment identification (243) may use threshold values corresponding to fields in the aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341) to select users (e.g., 101) based on spending pattern; and the portal (143) is configured to use the aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341) generated by the profile generator (121) and the threshold values to identify the target set of users (e.g., 101). Alternatively or in combination, the user segment identification (243) may be based at least in part on the account data (111), such as the geographic location of the users (e.g., 101) and/or other demographic information, such as gender, age, etc.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to select the top ranked triggers in an automated way. In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to present the ranked list of triggers (247) to the marketer (241) via a user interface of the portal (143) and allow the marketer (241) to select the one or more selected triggers (247).
In one embodiment, the triggers are defined by the marketer (241) via the trigger identification (245) that specifies the trigger conditions of the respective triggers. In one embodiment, the triggers are predefined by the portal (143).
In one embodiment, the triggers (247) are ranked based on a likelihood of transactions of the users (e.g., 101) in the set satisfying conditions specified in respective triggers (247), estimated spending amounts for transactions satisfying conditions specified in respective triggers (247), and/or a likelihood of the users (e.g., 101) responding to the message.
In one embodiment, the advertisement transmitted in response to a transaction satisfying a trigger record (207) relates to an offer of a benefit; and the transaction handler (103) is configured to provide the benefit via statement credit after a fulfillment requirement of the offer is satisfied based on transaction data (109) from the transaction handler (103).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to enroll users (101) for the reception of the offers (186). An enrolled user (101) provides a communication reference (205), such as a mobile phone number, an email address, etc., that is stored as part of the account data (111) of the enrolled user (101). The message broker (201) is configured to use the communication reference (205) of the enrolled user (101) to transmit the real-time message to the point of interaction (107) of the user (101), in response to a transaction of the user (101).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to store the trigger records (207) in the data warehouse (149) to represent the one or more selected triggers. The transaction handler (103) and/or the message broker (201) is configured to check transactions being processed by the transaction handler (103) against the trigger records (207) to determine whether the conditions specified in a trigger record (207) are satisfied by the current transaction being processed by the transaction handler (103) and, if satisfied, cause an action specified in the trigger record (207) for the delivery of the message related to the advertisement (e.g., offer (186)).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus/system includes at least one of: the portal (143), the message broker (201), the profile generator (121), the media controller (115), the transaction handler (103), and the data warehouse (149). In one embodiment, the portal (143) includes an analytics engine to rank the triggers (247) and/or select the triggers (247) on behalf of a marketer (241).
In one embodiment, the ranked list of triggers (247) is presented to the marketer (241) for selection. In another embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to select the top triggers (247) from the ranked list for the marketer (241) in an automated way; and the portal (143) may update the selection periodically based on tracked subsequent payment transactions resulting from the advertisement.
Trigger Visualization
In one embodiment, to help marketers set up and use triggers, the portal (143) is configured to provide the marketer (241) with a user interface for the visualization of triggers for the transmission of the real-time messages. In one embodiment, the graphical representations of the triggers can be selected to cause the user interface to further display information associated with the triggers, such as the messages to be transmitted, the ranking of the triggers, trigger performance (251), likelihood of transactions satisfying the conditions specified in the respective trigger, estimated frequency of the transactions satisfying the conditions specified in the respective trigger, expected average transaction amounts satisfying the conditions specified in the respective trigger, etc. The visualization of the triggers and associated information allows the marketers (241) to prioritize, customize, and/or select triggers.
In one embodiment, visualization of the triggers is an optional operation. Marketers (241) using the portal (143) could skip store-level analyses and choose not to visualize the available triggers. However, if used, the visualization tool allows marketers (241) to explore candidates in a few locations to build up their intuition before creating and/or committing trigger rules. In one embodiment, the visualization tool allows the marketers (241) to browse relevant data in a graphical way and provides a possibility for serendipitous learning.
 FIG. 13 illustrates a graphical representation of triggers according to one embodiment. In FIG. 13, the graphical representation (260) shows the target merchant location (261) where the transactions resulting from the advertisement are expected to take place. The graphical representation (260) shows merchant locations (e.g., 263) that are near the target merchant location (261) and that can be used to set up triggers.
For example, in one embodiment, a trigger may be defined, or set up, as a transaction at the merchant location (263), made by a user (101) enrolled in the program to receive real-time promotion messages via the system illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 11. The trigger may include additional conditions that are to be met before the advertisement or offer (186) of the marketer (241), or a message related to the offer (186), is to be sent to the user (101). Examples of the conditions include a threshold for the amount involved in the transaction, the time period within a day in which the transaction is made, a requirement to purchase an item in a category specified by the marketer (241), etc.
In one embodiment, the marketer (241) may select the merchant location (263) to view data related to the trigger set using the merchant location (263). For example, such data may include the correlation degree of purchases made at the selected merchant location (263) and the purchases made at the target merchant location (261), determined based on past transaction data (109). For example, such data may include the correlation degree of the type of purchases made at the selected merchant location (263) and the type of purchases made at the target merchant location (261), determined based on past transaction data (109). For example, such data may include the population size of general users who have made purchases at the merchant location (263), and/or the population size of enrolled users who have made purchases at the merchant location (263). For example, such data may include the spending frequency and/or amount by the enrolled users at the selected merchant location (263).
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) shows a ranked set of triggers at their corresponding merchant locations (e.g., 263). For example, in FIG. 13, the triggers are ranked in alphabetical order (e.g., A, B, . . . ) so that the marketer (241) may explore the top ranking triggers first. Examples and details of ranking triggers in one embodiment are provided in the section entitled âTRIGGER RANK.â
In one embodiment, after the message campaign starts, the portal (143) is configured to track the performance of the triggers; and the graphical representation (260) is configured to display the triggers according to the performance of the triggers. The respective graphical representations of the triggers (e.g., 263) can be selected to view the statistics about respective triggers, such as the numbers of messages or offers transmitted in accordance with the triggers, purchase transactions resulting from the transmission of the messages or offers, an aggregated spending profile of a group of users receiving the messages or offers via the triggers, an aggregated spending profile of a group of users responding to the messages or offers, etc.
In one embodiment, the merchant locations and/or the triggers are ranked by the portal (143) using the transaction data (109). Thus, the top ranking triggers are presented in the graphical representation (260) and the bottom ranking triggers and/or locations are not presented to avoid cluttering. In one embodiment, the graphical representation includes a set of navigation controls that allow the marketer (241) to selectively view a subset of the ranked triggers (e.g., the top predetermined number of triggers, or the next predetermined number of triggers, etc.)
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to make trigger recommendations using a location score. For example, in one embodiment, the location score is computed based on multiplying the aggregated enrollees' spending at the merchant location (263) by the probability that the spending at the merchant location (263) is followed by spending at the target merchant location (261) within a predetermined period of time (e.g., one hour, three hours, a day, or the same day). Thus, the graphical representation (260) helps the marketer (243) visualize a merchant location (263) for how a trigger might work.
In one embodiment, the triggers are ranked according to the location score. In one embodiment, the portal (143) ranks the triggers according to the methods discussed in the section entitled âTRIGGER RANK.â
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) of FIG. 13 shows the locations (e.g., 265) that may be used for triggers but are not in the recommended list of trigger locations, or not currently used in the triggers selected by the marketer (241). The graphical representation (260) allows the marketer to explore the identity of the merchants at the locations (e.g., 265), and/or related transaction-based intelligence information, such as the location score, the probability of transactions occurring at the location (265), the expected transaction amount at the location (265), the probability of a transaction at the location (265) followed by a purchase at the merchant location (261), the spending patterns of enrolled users who made transactions at the location (265), the spending patterns of enrolled uses who made transactions at the location (265) at a frequency higher than a threshold, etc.
Alternatively or in combination, the graphical representation of FIG. 13 shows the locations (e.g., 265) of enrolled users and/or the locations (e.g., 265) of the target set of users (e.g., 101). The graphical representation (260) allows the marketer (241) to explore the spending attributes of the users at the locations (e.g., 265), such as the values (342-347) in the aggregated spending profile (341) of the users (e.g., 101). The attributes can be used in formulating triggers.
The graphical representation (260) provided in FIG. 13 is intended for illustration purposes. The actual tool can show other items such as competitive merchant locations, show more information on the screen, allow the marketer (241) to right-click to create a trigger rule on the spot, delete a trigger, modify a trigger, view real time transaction data related to the triggers, etc.
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) not only shows data about enrollees but also data related to other users who have similar spending patterns as enrollees. The similarity between the users can be identified based on the spending profiles (e.g., 341, 127, and 131).
 FIG. 14 illustrates a method to present triggers according to one embodiment. In FIG. 14, a computing apparatus is configured to identify (271) a set of triggers for delivery of the advertisement to the target set of users (e.g., 101), provide (273) a graphical representation (260) of the triggers, and provide (275) data related to the triggers on the graphical representation (260), in response to user interaction with the graphical representation (260).
In one embodiment, each of the triggers identifies a set of one or more conditions which, when satisfied by a transaction of a user (101), causes the transmission of a message to the user (101) in real time as the transaction is being processed by the transaction handler.
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) includes a map showing the locations of the triggers. In one embodiment, the location of a trigger corresponds to the location of a merchant (e.g., 263) at which the transaction is to occur to satisfy the requirements of the trigger.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to rank the triggers based on transaction data (109) recorded by the transaction handler (103); and the graphical representation (260) indicates the ranks of the triggers (e.g., via A, B, C, etc. in FIG. 13).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to determine a score for each of the plurality of triggers, based on an amount of transactions performed at the location of a respective trigger and a probability of a transaction at the location of the respective trigger followed by a transaction at a location of a merchant for which the message is to be transmitted. In one embodiment, the triggers are ranked based on the score.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to provide a user interface to receive user identification information from a marketer (241) and identify a plurality of users (e.g., 101) who satisfy the user identification information. The message is specified to be transmitted to the plurality of users (e.g., 101) according to the plurality of triggers. In one embodiment, the message is not transmitted to users who are not among the plurality of users who satisfy the user identification information.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to receive a selection of a first trigger from the graphical representation (260) of the plurality of triggers and provide data related to the first trigger on the graphical representation (260), in response to the selection of the first trigger.
For example, in one embodiment, the data provided in response to the selection of the first trigger includes: an indication of a degree of relevancy between a transaction desired by the message and a transaction satisfying the condition of the first trigger, an indication of an occurrence frequency of transactions satisfying the first trigger, an indication of a population size of users eligible for the message to be transmitted in accordance with the first trigger, and/or an indication of spending amounts of users eligible for the message to be transmitted in accordance with the first trigger.
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) includes at least one first location (e.g., 265) which when selected causes a presentation of a user interface to set up a trigger at the first location (e.g., 265).
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) includes at least one candidate for a first trigger at a first location (265), which when selected causes a presentation of support data for setting up the first trigger at the first location (265). For example, in one embodiment, the support data includes at least one of: a probability of transactions occurring at the first location (265); a probability of a transaction at the first location (265) followed by a transaction at a location of a merchant for which the message is to be transmitted; and a spending pattern of users who have made transactions at the first location (265).
In one embodiment, the spending pattern of users who have made transactions at the first location (265) is based on one or more fields of an aggregated spending profile (341) of the users.
In one embodiment, the graphical representation (260) includes further information such as indication of performances of the plurality of triggers, numbers of potential users associated with the triggers, etc.
In one embodiment, the triggers are represented on the graphical representation (260) via icons (e.g., 263). The icons can be further selected to explore information associated with the respective triggers, such as the message to be transmitted when a transaction satisfying the conditions of the trigger is detected, at least one condition of a transaction occurring in a location of the trigger, performance information of the first trigger, opportunity information for using the first trigger, etc.
In one embodiment, the performance information includes the location score of the trigger, the rank of the trigger, statistics of past transactions that are generated as a result of the message transmitted in accordance with the trigger, and/or statistics of past transactions that would satisfy the requirements of the trigger.
In one embodiment, the opportunity information includes the number of enrolled users (101) who have made transactions in the past at the location of the trigger, the spending patterns of such users (101), the aggregated spending profile of such users (101) as a group, the spending amount and/or frequency of such users (101) in a merchant category relevant to the marketer (241), etc.
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus/system includes at least one of: the transaction handler (103) to process the transactions and the data warehouse (149) coupled with the transaction handler to store transaction data (109) recording the transactions, the portal (143) coupled with the transaction handler (103) and the data warehouse (149), the message broker (201) coupled with the transaction handler (103) and the data warehouse (149) to generate and transmit the message using a communication reference (205) of the user (101), the media controller (115), and the profile generator (121).
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to receive first data based on which a set of users is identified, and receive second data based on which a plurality of triggers are identified, and present the plurality of triggers on a map showing a location (261) of a merchant on behalf of which the message is to be transmitted. The message may include an advertisement, an offer (186), a reminder of the offer (186), etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) includes an analytical engine that ranks triggers and/or merchant locations (e.g., 263, 265) for the graphical representation (260).
Cooperative Database
In one embodiment, a cooperative database is configured to organize intelligence information that can be used to target the delivery of offers by different merchants. In one embodiment, the intelligence information is organized in the cooperative database according to communities. A merchant of a community is provided with the facility to selectively share the intelligence information associated with the merchant with other merchants.
In one embodiment, the intelligence information includes the identification of users (101) who are enrolled to receive offers (186) via the message broker (201). For example, cardholders, such as the user (101), may register in a program to receive offers (186), such as promotions, discounts, sweepstakes, reward points, direct mail coupons, email coupons, etc. The cardholders may register with issuers, or with the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103), or with participating merchants.
For example, in one embodiment, a cardholder may enroll in a program associated with a first merchant but not in a program associated with a second merchant. The cooperative database allows the first merchant to selectively share with the second merchant the information about the enrollment in the program associated with the first merchant to allow the second merchant to target offer delivery based on the enrollment in the program associated with the first merchant.
In one embodiment, the cardholders (e.g., user (101)) whose payment transactions are processed by the transaction handler (103) enroll with their respective issuers. The issuers may provide incentives to cardholders or enrollees to encourage enrollments. The issuers may set up limitations on allowable marketing activities, based on marketing objectives of the issuers and/or knowledge about the needs and concerns of the enrollees to protect the interest and/or privacy of the enrollees. The cardholders enrolled by the issuers are then presented via the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) for marketing arrangements. For example, in one embodiment, the issuer-enrolled cardholders are assigned to one or more clusters based on the spending behaviors reflected in their aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341). Merchants may target offers according to the spending behaviors reflected in the aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341).
In one embodiment, the cardholders may enroll in the program via merchants, in a way similar to enrolling via issuers.
In one embodiment, the cardholders may directly enroll in the program via the portal (143), without having to enroll through respective issuers.
 FIG. 15 illustrates a system to use a cooperative database to target offers according to one embodiment. In FIG. 15, the data warehouse (149) organizes enrollees into communities (e.g., 401, 402, etc.).
In one embodiment, the assignment of enrollees in the communities (e.g., 401, 402, etc.) is not exclusive. For example, an enrollee may be in multiple communities. Alternatively, each enrollee is to be assigned to only one community in one embodiment.
In one embodiment, a community (e.g., 401) is to be associated with one or more entities such as merchants, issuers, acquirers, etc. Such entities in the community (e.g., 401) agree to share information about the identification of the enrollees in the community (e.g., 401) for the purpose of targeting offers to the enrollees in the community (e.g., 401), and may set up restrictions and/or permissions on marketing access to enrollees by merchants associated with other communities.
In one embodiment, the identification of the enrollees in a community (e.g., 401) is based on information related to and/or received from the merchants in the community (e.g., 401). When a user (101) is identified via information related to and/or received from a first merchant, the identification of the user (101) is generally limited to being used by the first merchant. Through the use of the cooperative dataset, the first merchant can selectively share the identification of the user (101) with other second merchants, which may also share the identification of users made via information related to and/or received by the second merchants with the first merchant via the community arrangement.
In one embodiment, the enrollees in the community (e.g., 401) are the customers of the merchants in the community (e.g., 401). The enrollees may be enrolled by the merchants (e.g., via a loyalty program). In one embodiment, the merchants are represented by respective acquirers in the enrollment process. For example, a set of merchants, issuers and/or acquirers may set up a community (e.g., 401) and enroll users (e.g., 101) in the community (e.g., 401) for receiving a type of offers. In one embodiment, one or more issuers or the portal (143) associated with the transaction handler (103) are used to enroll the cardholders for real-time delivery of offers (186).
In one embodiment, the enrollees are enrolled via the portal (143); and the enrollees are assigned to the community (e.g., 401) based on the transaction data (109). For example, in one embodiment, when the enrollees have a spending pattern with the one or more merchants in the community (e.g., 401), the enrollees are assigned to the community (e.g., 401); for example, in one embodiment, when the enrollees have spent more than a threshold amount with the merchants in the community (e.g., 401), the enrollees are assigned to the community (e.g., 401); for example, in one embodiment, when the enrollees have recently shopped with the merchants in the community (e.g., 401), the enrollees are assigned to the community (e.g., 401). The identification of the association of an enrollee and the community (401) provides information on the spending behavior of the enrollee in connection with the business entities in the community (401). The portal (143) provides a user interface to allow the respective business entities, such as merchants, issuers, acquirers, etc., to set up access control to protect the availability of the identification information and to selectively allow marketing to the enrollees identified via the community (401).
In one embodiment, the identification of the communities (e.g., 401-402) can be used by merchants to identify the target set of enrollees for offer targeting and/or set up triggers for the delivery of the offers.
For example, in one embodiment, the enrollees in community A (401) are customers of one or more merchants. The merchants may provide data (e.g., 403) allowing certain merchants to market to the enrollees via the community A (401) and disallowing other merchants to market to the enrollees via the community A (401).
For example, in one embodiment, the enrollees in community A (401) are enrolled via one or more issuers; and the issuers may set up limitations (e.g., 405) on allowable marketing activities, based on marketing objectives of the issuers, and the interests and concerns of the enrollees.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) provides an interface to assist merchants to formulate rules (203) to target offers (186). For example, the merchants may use the portal (143) to explore the information regarding potential customers, based on the spending behavior patterns extracted from the transaction data (109) and/or other information, such as relevant merchants, nearby merchants, etc.
Based on the spending behavior patterns and/or other parameters, the merchants may apply various filters to select a target set of enrollees for targeting offers.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103) provides a user interface to allow the merchants to set up triggers for the delivery of their offers. The analytical engine (415) is to provide the intelligence information based at least in part on the past payment transactions, which allows the merchants to gain data insights for campaign targeting. For example, in one embodiment, at least part of the intelligence information can be presented via the trigger visualization technique described in the section entitled âTRIGGER VISUALIZATION.â
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to limit the targeting of offers based on the partner data (e.g., 403-406) in the communities (e.g., 401-402). For example, based on the partner data (e.g., 403-406), the portal (143) is to determine whether a particular merchant is entitled to select enrollees based on the identification of a community (e.g., 401).
For example, in one embodiment, when permitted by the partner data (403, 405, . . . ) of the community A (401), a merchant of community B (402) may choose to select the enrollees of the community A (401) as the target set of users for receiving an offer (186) from the merchant of community B (402). In one embodiment, the merchant of community B (402) can further apply filters, based on spending patterns and/or other conditions, to select a subset of the enrollees from the community A (401) to form the target set of users. In one embodiment, the merchant of community B (402) may select multiple subsets from one or more communities to form the target set of users.
Thus, the system allows the merchants and/or other entities such as issuers and/or acquirers to set up rules to allow the sharing of information related to the relationships between enrollees and the business entities and to allow collaboration in targeting offers.
After the trigger records (207) are determined using the self-service interface provided to the merchants via the portal (143), the event detection engine (413) monitors the transaction data (109) in real-time with the processing of the respective transactions to detect events that satisfy the trigger records (207). In response to events satisfying the trigger records (207), the message broker (201) is to use the media controller (115) to transmit messages to the point of interaction (107) of the respective enrollees, in real-time with the processing of the corresponding triggering transaction by the transaction handler (103). For example, the messages can be transmitted via SMS, email, or social media in accordance with the communication reference (205) of an enrollee, such as the user (101).
In FIG. 15, the system includes an analytical engine (415) and a pattern recognition engine (411). In one embodiment, a triggering event is identified based on a transaction pattern; and the last transaction that causes the detection of the pattern by the pattern recognition engine (411) is used as a triggering transaction; and the real-time message is transmitted to the enrollee who made the payment through the triggering transaction. In one embodiment, a trigger is detected based on frequency, recency, payment amount, propensity to redeem, and/or a pattern of multiple transactions.
In one embodiment, the message broker (201) is configured to generate notification messages when the enrollees make the transactions that satisfy the redemption requirements of the offers (186). The transaction handler (103) is configured to provide the benefits of the offers (186) via statement credits in one embodiment.
In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is configured to correlate the offers (186) with the purchases that redeem the offers (186) to measure the performance of the offers (186). The portal (143) is configured to provide a user interface for the merchants to request a performance report for the offers (186).
In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) is configured to use various information about an enrollee to build a model for determining the relevancy of an offer (186) relative to an opportunity to provide the offer (186) to the enrollee (e.g., user (101)).
In one embodiment, advertisers are allowed to place bids for the targeting opportunity via the portal (143); and the message broker (201) is configured to use the bids and the relevance determined by the model to select an offer from a plurality of competing offers (186). In one embodiment, the analytical engine (415) includes a learning module to improve the evaluation of the relevancy based on the tracked performance of the offers (186).
In one embodiment, a trigger is set up to transmit an offer (186) from a merchant when an enrollee, such as the user (101), is shopping with the merchant. In one embodiment, the offer (186) is sent to entice the enrollee to come back to the merchant sooner than normal. For example, the offer (186) may provide a discount valid for a short period of time (e.g., one week). In some embodiments, based on the cooperative database, the offer (186) provides a discount for a purchase at a cross-over merchant and/or for complimentary products or services.
In one embodiment, a trigger is set up to transmit an offer (186) from a merchant when an enrollee, such as the user (101), is shopping near the merchant. In one embodiment, the offer (186) is sent to entice the enrollee to come to the merchant. For example, the offer (186) may provide a discount valid for a short period of time (e.g., 2 hours); and the offer (186) may be sent with the information about the nearest locations of the merchant. For example, in accordance with the rules in the cooperative database, an offer (186) from a first merchant may be sent to an enrollee when the enrollee makes a purchase from a second merchant. The offer (186) may provide product information and/or a discount, reward, gift, incentive, or statement credit. In one embodiment, an offer (186) is sent when the enrollee makes a payment transaction at a peer set merchant category.
In one embodiment, the analytical engine (415) is configured to predict whether an enrollee plans to be near a merchant. If the enrollee plans to be near a merchant based on the prediction, an offer (186) valid for the next period of time (e.g., a few hours) is transmitted to the enrollee.
In one embodiment, the pattern recognition engine (411) is configured to determine the spending pattern of the enrollee, such as the typical spending amount with the merchant; and the offer (186) provides a discount when the enrollee spends an amount more than the typical spending amount.
In one embodiment, the offer (186) is sent based on a spending frequency (e.g., one discount offer transmitted every 5th time of the occurrence of a recognized transaction pattern).
In one embodiment, the partner data (403) associated with a partner merchant in the community (401) allows a merchant in the community to request an offer (186) of the merchant to be transmitted to an enrollee when the enrollee makes a purchase from the merchant. In one embodiment, an offer (186) of a merchant in the community (401) is configured to be provided to an enrollee when the enrollee makes a purchase (from a separate partner merchant) that has a high correlation or affinity in relation to purchases at the merchant. In one embodiment, when the enrollee makes a purchase in a peer set merchant category, the message broker (201) is to identify from the peer set merchant category a merchant that has the highest affinity relation to the purchase and transmit an offer (186) from the identified merchant to the enrollee.
In one embodiment, the analytical engine (415) is configured to predict what an enrollee needs based on the purchase history of the enrollee. An offer (186) from the merchant who provides products or services that meet the predicted needs of the enrollee is sent to the enrollee in response to the prediction. In one embodiment, the offer (186) may provide a discount on items not commonly purchased. In one embodiment, the offer (186) may provide a discount when the enrollee spends more than the typical spending amount. The offer (186) may be configured to be valid for a time period that ends before the time predicted for the next purchase of the enrollee.
In one embodiment, the analytical engine (415) and/or the pattern recognition engine (411) is configured to detect the change in spending behavior of an enrollee. An offer (186) from the merchant is configured to be sent in response to a detected change in spending behavior. For example, in one embodiment, an offer (186) is provided to an enrollee when the enrollee is purchasing less often. In one embodiment, a notification is provided to the enrollee when there is a change in the zip code (347) of the dominant geographic area in which the spending associated with the enrollee occurs. In one embodiment, an offer (186) is provided to an enrollee when the purchases made by the enrollee are less valuable than previous purchases.
In one embodiment, an offer (186) is transmitted to an enrollee when the activities of the enrollee in a loyalty program decrease.
 FIG. 16 illustrates a method to target offers using a cooperative database according to one embodiment. In one embodiment, a computing apparatus is configured to store (281) transaction data (109) recording transactions processed by a transaction handler (103), organize (283) entities (e.g., merchants, issuers, acquires, users (101)) according to community, receive (285) a request from a merchant in a second community (402) but not in a first community (401), and present (287) an offer (186) of the merchant in the second community (402) to users (101) identified via the transaction data (109) and first data (e.g., 403) in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the first data (e.g., 403) is received from a separate merchant in the first community (401). In one embodiment, the first data (e.g., 403) includes enrollment data. In one embodiment, the first data (e.g., 403) provides permission for the merchant in the second community (402) to use the relationship between the users and the merchants in the first community (401) to identify the users (101).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to organize third party data according to community, where the third party data includes the first data (e.g., 403, 405) received from a first plurality of entities of the first community (401) and second data (e.g., 404, 406) received from a second plurality of entities of a second community (402). According to a request from the merchant in the second community (402), the computing apparatus presents an offer of the merchant in the second community (402) to users (e.g., 101) identified via the transaction data (109) and the first data (e.g., 403) received from the first plurality of entities of the first community (401). In one embodiment, the merchant in the second community (402) is not in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the first data (403) includes limitations on access to the first data by entities outside the first community (401); and the users are identified in accordance with the limitations. In one embodiment, the limitations are specified by the entities in the first community (401) via the portal (143) of the transaction handler (103). In one embodiment, the limitations are specified by a merchant, an issuer, or an acquirer in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the request from the merchant in the second community (402) specifies that the users be identified as customers of a merchant in the first community (401) who have not made purchases from the merchant in the second community (402) in a predefined recent time period (e.g., a week, a month, a quarter, a year).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to monitor first transactions of the users during processing of the first transactions by the transaction handler (103), detect a subset of the first transactions satisfying presentation requirements of the offer (186) (e.g., as specified in the trigger records (207) associated with the offer (186)), and present the offer (186) of a merchant to users corresponding to the subset of the first transactions, in real-time with the processing of the respective transactions in the subset by the transaction handler (103) (e.g., after the transaction handler (103) receives the authorization requests for the respective transactions, before or shortly after the transaction handler (103) provides the authorization responses for the respective transactions).
In one embodiment, the request from the merchant in the second community (402) specifies that the first transactions with one or more merchants in the first community (401) be monitored for the presenting of the offer (186). Certain first transactions with one or more merchants in the first community (401) satisfying the trigger records (207) can trigger the message related to the offer (186) from the merchant in the second community (402), in accordance with the access provided by the first data (e.g., 403) to the merchant in the second community (402), as specified in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the request from the merchant in the second community (402) specifies that users enrolled in the first community (401) be monitored for the presenting of the offer (186). Certain actions by the enrollees in the first community (401) can trigger the message related to the offer (186) from the merchant in the second community (402), in accordance with the access provided by the first data (e.g., 403) to the merchant in the second community (402), as specified in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the offer (186) of the merchant in the second community (402) is transmitted to the users that are identified via the transaction data and the first data (e.g., 403) via communication references (205) registered during enrollment in the first community (401). Examples of the communication references (205) include phone number, email address and references for social media. In one embodiment, the first data (e.g., 403) includes the communication references (205) as specified during the enrollment of the account holders in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to determine a spending pattern from the transaction data (109); and the users who receive the offer (186) are identified further based on the spending pattern. In one embodiment, the spending pattern includes a plurality of transactions; and a last transaction in the spending pattern triggers a presentation of the offer (186).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus is configured to predict a time of a next purchase of a first user (101) who is identified via the transaction data (109) and the first data (e.g., 403) received from the first plurality of entities of the first community (401); and the offer (186) is provided to the first user (101) prior to the predicted time of the next purchase. In one embodiment, the offer (186) provided to the first user (101) is configured to expire prior to the predicted time of the next purchase.
In one embodiment, the first data (e.g., 403) includes identification information of account holders (e.g., user (101)) who have enrolled in the first community (401); and the users who are presented with the offer (186) from the merchant in the second community (402) are identified based at least in part on the identification information. In one embodiment, the account holder (e.g., user (101)) is enrolled in the first community (401) but not the second community (402). In one embodiment, the account holder (e.g., user (101)) is enrolled in both the first community (401) and the second community (402). In one embodiment, the user (101) is presented with the offer (186) from the merchant in the second community (402) at least in part as a result of having enrolled in the first community (401).
In one embodiment, the computing apparatus includes one or more of: the data warehouse (149) storing the transaction data and the data (e.g., 403-406) that are organized according to communities (e.g., 401-403), the transaction handler (103) configured to process the transactions recorded by the transaction data (109), the portal (143) configured to receive first data (403, 405) from a first plurality of entities of a first community (401) and second data (404, 406) from a second plurality of entities of a second community (402) and configured to receive a request from a merchant in the second community (402) for an offer (186), the message broker (201) configured to generate a message containing the offer (186) to users identified via the transaction data (109) and the first data (403, 405) received from the first plurality of entities of the first community (401), the media controller (115) configured to communicate messages generated by the message broker (201) to the point of interaction (107), the pattern recognition engine (411) configured to detect spending patterns for the detection of events that can trigger the delivery of the messages generated by the message broker (201), the event detection engine (413) configured to detect the occurrence of events, based on the transaction data (109), that satisfy the requirements for presentation of the offer (186), the analytical engine (415) configured to predict the needs and future activities of the users (101) based on the transaction data (109), the correlator (117) configured to correlate the offers (186) with the purchases that redeem the offers (186) to measure the performance of the offers (186), and the advertisement selector (133) configured to select the offer (186) for the respective users (101).
Some details about the system in one embodiment are provided in the section entitled âSYSTEM,â âCENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSEâ and âHARDWARE.â
Variations
Some embodiments use more or fewer components than those illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 4-7. For example, in one embodiment, the user specific profile (131) is used by a search engine to prioritize search results. In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is to correlate transactions with online activities, such as searching, web browsing, and social networking, instead of or in addition to the user specific advertisement data (119). In one embodiment, the correlator (117) is to correlate transactions and/or spending patterns with news announcements, market changes, events, natural disasters, etc. In one embodiment, the data to be correlated by the correlator with the transaction data (109) may not be personalized via the user specific profile (131) and may not be user specific. In one embodiment, multiple different devices are used at the point of interaction (107) for interaction with the user (101); and some of the devices may not be capable of receiving input from the user (101). In one embodiment, there are transaction terminals (105) to initiate transactions for a plurality of users (101) with a plurality of different merchants. In one embodiment, the account information (142) is provided to the transaction terminal (105) directly (e.g., via phone or Internet) without the use of the account identification device (141).
In one embodiment, at least some of the profile generator (121), correlator (117), profile selector (129), and advertisement selector (133) are controlled by the entity that operates the transaction handler (103). In another embodiment, at least some of the profile generator (121), correlator (117), profile selector (129), and advertisement selector (133) are not controlled by the entity that operates the transaction handler (103).
For example, in one embodiment, the entity operating the transaction handler (103) provides the intelligence (e.g., transaction profiles (127) or the user specific profile (131)) for the selection of the advertisement; and a third party (e.g., a web search engine, a publisher, or a retailer) may present the advertisement in a context outside a transaction involving the transaction handler (103) before the advertisement results in a purchase.
For example, in one embodiment, the customer may interact with the third party at the point of interaction (107); and the entity controlling the transaction handler (103) may allow the third party to query for intelligence information (e.g., transaction profiles (127), or the user specific profile (131)) about the customer using the user data (125), thus informing the third party of the intelligence information for targeting the advertisements, which can be more useful, effective and compelling to the user (101). For example, the entity operating the transaction handler (103) may provide the intelligence information without generating, identifying or selecting advertisements; and the third party receiving the intelligence information may identify, select and/or present advertisements.
Through the use of the transaction data (109), account data (111), correlation results (123), the context at the point of interaction, and/or other data, relevant and compelling messages or advertisements can be selected for the customer at the points of interaction (e.g., 107) for targeted advertising. The messages or advertisements are thus delivered at the optimal time for influencing or reinforcing brand perceptions and revenue-generating behavior. The customers receive the advertisements in the media channels that they like and/or use most frequently.
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) includes transaction amounts, the identities of the payees (e.g., merchants), and the date and time of the transactions. The identities of the payees can be correlated to the businesses, services, products and/or locations of the payees. For example, the transaction handler (103) maintains a database of merchant data, including the merchant locations, businesses, services, products, etc. Thus, the transaction data (109) can be used to determine the purchase behavior, pattern, preference, tendency, frequency, trend, budget and/or propensity of the customers in relation to various types of businesses, services and/or products and in relation to time.
In one embodiment, the products and/or services purchased by the user (101) are also identified by the information transmitted from the merchants or service providers. Thus, the transaction data (109) may include identification of the individual products and/or services, which allows the profile generator (121) to generate transaction profiles (127) with fine granularity or resolution. In one embodiment, the granularity or resolution may be at a level of distinct products and services that can be purchased (e.g., stock-keeping unit (SKU) level), or category or type of products or services, or vendor of products or services, etc.
The profile generator (121) may consolidate transaction data for a person having multiple accounts to derive intelligence information about the person to generate a profile for the person (e.g., transaction profiles (127), or the user specific profile (131)).
The profile generator (121) may consolidate transaction data for a family having multiple accounts held by family members to derive intelligence information about the family to generate a profile for the family (e.g., transaction profiles (127), or the user specific profile (131)).
Similarly, the profile generator (121) may consolidate transaction data for a group of persons, after the group is identified by certain characteristics, such as gender, income level, geographical location or region, preference, characteristics of past purchases (e.g., merchant categories, purchase types), cluster, propensity, demographics, social networking characteristics (e.g., relationships, preferences, activities on social networking websites), etc. The consolidated transaction data can be used to derive intelligence information about the group to generate a profile for the group (e.g., transaction profiles (127), or the user specific profile (131)).
In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) may consolidate transaction data according to the user data (125) to generate a profile specific to the user data (125).
Since the transaction data (109) are records and history of past purchases, the profile generator (121) can derive intelligence information about a customer using an account, a customer using multiple accounts, a family, a company, or other groups of customers, about what the targeted audience is likely to purchase in the future, how frequently, and their likely budgets for such future purchases. Intelligence information is useful in selecting the advertisements that are most useful, effective and compelling to the customer, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the advertising process.
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) are enhanced with correlation results (123) correlating past advertisements and purchases that result at least in part from the advertisements. Thus, the intelligence information can be more accurate in assisting with the selection of the advertisements. The intelligence information may not only indicate what the audience is likely to purchase, but also how likely the audience is to be influenced by advertisements for certain purchases, and the relative effectiveness of different forms of advertisements for the audience. Thus, the advertisement selector (133) can select the advertisements to best use the opportunity to communicate with the audience. Further, the transaction data (109) can be enhanced via other data elements, such as program enrollment, affinity programs, redemption of reward points (or other types of offers), online activities, such as web searches and web browsing, social networking information, etc., based on the account data (111) and/or other data, such as non-transactional data discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/614,603, filed Nov. 9, 2009, assigned Pub. No. 2011/0054981, and entitled âAnalyzing Local Non-Transactional Data with Transactional Data in Predictive Models,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, the entity operating the transaction handler (103) provides the intelligence information in real-time as the request for the intelligence information occurs. In other embodiments, the entity operating the transaction handler (103) may provide the intelligence information in batch mode. The intelligence information can be delivered via online communications (e.g., via an application programming interface (API) on a website, or other information server), or via physical transportation of a computer readable media that stores the data representing the intelligence information.
In one embodiment, the intelligence information is communicated to various entities in the system in a way similar to, and/or in parallel with the information flow in the transaction system to move money. The transaction handler (103) routes the information in the same way it routes the currency involved in the transactions.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides a user interface to allow the user (101) to select items offered on different merchant websites and store the selected items in a wish list for comparison, reviewing, purchasing, tracking, etc. The information collected via the wish list can be used to improve the transaction profiles (127) and derive intelligence on the needs of the user (101); and targeted advertisements can be delivered to the user (101) via the wish list user interface provided by the portal (143). Examples of user interface systems to manage wish lists are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/683,802, filed Jan. 7, 2010, assigned Pub. No. 2010/0174623, and entitled âSystem and Method for Managing Items of Interest Selected from Online Merchants,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Aggregated Spending Profile
In one embodiment, the characteristics of transaction patterns of customers are profiled via clusters, factors, and/or categories of purchases. The transaction data (109) may include transaction records (301); and in one embodiment, an aggregated spending profile (341) is generated from the transaction records (301), in a way illustrated in FIG. 2, to summarize the spending behavior reflected in the transaction records (301).
In one embodiment, each of the transaction records (301) is for a particular transaction processed by the transaction handler (103). Each of the transaction records (301) provides information about the particular transaction, such as the account number (302) of the consumer account (146) used to pay for the purchase, the date (303) (and/or time) of the transaction, the amount (304) of the transaction, the ID (305) of the merchant who receives the payment, the category (306) of the merchant, the channel (307) through which the purchase was made, etc. Examples of channels include online, offline in-store, via phone, etc. In one embodiment, the transaction records (301) may further include a field to identify a type of transaction, such as card-present, card-not-present, etc.
In one embodiment, a âcard-presentâ transaction involves physically presenting the account identification device (141), such as a financial transaction card, to the merchant (e.g., via swiping a credit card at a POS terminal of a merchant); and a âcard-not-presentâ transaction involves presenting the account information (142) of the consumer account (146) to the merchant to identify the consumer account (146) without physically presenting the account identification device (141) to the merchant or the transaction terminal (105).
In one embodiment, certain information about the transaction can be looked up in a separate database based on other information recorded for the transaction. For example, a database may be used to store information about merchants, such as the geographical locations of the merchants, categories of the merchants, etc. Thus, the corresponding merchant information related to a transaction can be determined using the merchant ID (305) recorded for the transaction.
In one embodiment, the transaction records (301) may further include details about the products and/or services involved in the purchase. For example, a list of items purchased in the transaction may be recorded together with the respective purchase prices of the items and/or the respective quantities of the purchased items. The products and/or services can be identified via stock-keeping unit (SKU) numbers, or product category IDs. The purchase details may be stored in a separate database and be looked up based on an identifier of the transaction.
When there is voluminous data representing the transaction records (301), the spending patterns reflected in the transaction records (301) can be difficult to recognize by an ordinary person.
In one embodiment, the voluminous transaction records (301) are summarized (335) into aggregated spending profiles (e.g., 341) to concisely present the statistical spending characteristics reflected in the transaction records (301). The aggregated spending profile (341) uses values derived from statistical analysis to present the statistical characteristics of transaction records (301) of an entity in a way easy to understand by an ordinary person.
In FIG. 2, the transaction records (301) are summarized (335) via factor analysis (327) to condense the variables (e.g., 313, 315) and via cluster analysis (329) to segregate entities by spending patterns.
In FIG. 2, a set of variables (e.g., 311, 313, 315) are defined based on the parameters recorded in the transaction records (301). The variables (e.g., 311, 313, and 315) are defined in a way to have meanings easily understood by an ordinary person. For example, variables (311) measure the aggregated spending in super categories; variables (313) measure the spending frequencies in various areas; and variables (315) measure the spending amounts in various areas. In one embodiment, each of the areas is identified by a merchant category (306) (e.g., as represented by a merchant category code (MCC), a North American Industry Classification System (NAILS) code, or a similarly standardized category code). In other embodiments, an area may be identified by a product category, a SKU number, etc.
In one embodiment, a variable of a same category (e.g., frequency (313) or amount (315)) is defined to be aggregated over a set of mutually exclusive areas. A transaction is classified in only one of the mutually exclusive areas. For example, in one embodiment, the spending frequency variables (313) are defined for a set of mutually exclusive merchants or merchant categories. Transactions falling with the same category are aggregated.
Examples of the spending frequency variables (313) and spending amount variables (315) defined for various merchant categories (e.g., 306) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/537,566, filed Aug. 7, 2009, published as U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0306029 and entitled âCardholder Clusters,â and in Prov. U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No. 61/182,806, filed Jun. 1, 2009 and entitled âCardholder Clusters,â the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In one embodiment, super categories (311) are defined to group the categories (e.g., 306) used in transaction records (301). The super categories (311) can be mutually exclusive. For example, each merchant category (306) is classified under only one super merchant category but not any other super merchant categories. Since the generation of the list of super categories typically requires deep domain knowledge about the businesses of the merchants in various categories, super categories (311) are not used in one embodiment.
In one embodiment, the aggregation (317) includes the application of the definitions (309) for these variables (e.g., 311, 313, and 315) to the transaction records (301) to generate the variable values (321). The transaction records (301) are aggregated to generate aggregated measurements (e.g., variable values (321)) that are not specific to a particular transaction, such as frequencies of purchases made with different merchants or different groups of merchants, the amounts spent with different merchants or different groups of merchants, and the number of unique purchases across different merchants or different groups of merchants, etc. The aggregation (317) can be performed for a particular time period and for entities at various levels.
In one embodiment, the transaction records (301) are aggregated according to a buying entity. The aggregation (317) can be performed at account level, person level, family level, company level, neighborhood level, city level, region level, etc. to analyze the spending patterns across various areas (e.g., sellers, products or services) for the respective aggregated buying entity. For example, the transaction records (301) for a particular account (e.g., presented by the account number (302)) can be aggregated for an account level analysis. To aggregate the transaction records (301) in account level, the transactions with a specific merchant or merchants in a specific category are counted according to the variable definitions (309) for a particular account to generate a frequency measure (e.g., 313) for the account relative to the specific merchant or merchant category; and the transaction amounts (e.g., 304) with the specific merchant or the specific category of merchants are summed for the particular account to generate an average spending amount for the account relative to the specific merchant or merchant category. For example, the transaction records (301) for a particular person having multiple accounts can be aggregated for a person level analysis, the transaction records (301) aggregated for a particular family for a family level analysis, and the transaction records (301) for a particular business aggregated for a business level analysis.
The aggregation (317) can be performed for a predetermined time period, such as for the transactions occurring in the past month, in the past three months, in the past twelve months, etc.
In another embodiment, the transaction records (301) are aggregated according to a selling entity. The spending patterns at the selling entity across various buyers, products or services can be analyzed. For example, the transaction records (301) for a particular merchant having transactions with multiple accounts can be aggregated for a merchant level analysis. For example, the transaction records (301) for a particular merchant group can be aggregated for a merchant group level analysis.
In one embodiment, the aggregation (317) is formed separately for different types of transactions, such as transactions made online, offline, via phone, and/or âcard-presentâ transactions vs. âcard-not-presentâ transactions, which can be used to identify the spending pattern differences among different types of transactions.
In one embodiment, the variable values (e.g., 323, 324, . . . , 325) associated with an entity ID (322) are considered the random samples of the respective variables (e.g., 311, 313, 315), sampled for the instance of an entity represented by the entity ID (322). Statistical analyses (e.g., factor analysis (327) and cluster analysis (329)) are performed to identify the patterns and correlations in the random samples.
For example, a cluster analysis (329) can identify a set of clusters and thus cluster definitions (333) (e.g., the locations of the centroids of the clusters). In one embodiment, each entity ID (322) is represented as a point in a mathematical space defined by the set of variables; and the variable values (323, 324, . . . , 325) of the entity ID (322) determine the coordinates of the point in the space and thus the location of the point in the space. Various points may be concentrated in various regions; and the cluster analysis (329) is configured to formulate the positioning of the points to drive the clustering of the points. In other embodiments, the cluster analysis (329) can also be performed using the techniques of Self Organizing Maps (SOM), which can identify and show clusters of multi-dimensional data using a representation on a two-dimensional map.
Once the cluster definitions (333) are obtained from the cluster analysis (329), the identity of the cluster (e.g., cluster ID (343)) that contains the entity ID (322) can be used to characterize spending behavior of the entity represented by the entity ID (322). The entities in the same cluster are considered to have similar spending behaviors.
Similarities and differences among the entities, such as accounts, individuals, families, etc., as represented by the entity ID (e.g., 322) and characterized by the variable values (e.g., 323, 324, . . . , 325) can be identified via the cluster analysis (329). In one embodiment, after a number of clusters of entity IDs are identified based on the patterns of the aggregated measurements, a set of profiles can be generated for the clusters to represent the characteristics of the clusters. Once the clusters are identified, each of the entity IDs (e.g., corresponding to an account, individual, family) can be assigned to one cluster; and the profile for the corresponding cluster may be used to represent, at least in part, the entity (e.g., account, individual, family). Alternatively, the relationship between an entity (e.g., an account, individual, family) and one or more clusters can be determined (e.g., based on a measurement of closeness to each cluster). Thus, the cluster related data can be used in a transaction profile (127 or 341) to provide information about the behavior of the entity (e.g., an account, an individual, a family).
In one embodiment, more than one set of cluster definitions (333) is generated from cluster analyses (329). For example, cluster analyses (329) may generate different sets of cluster solutions corresponding to different numbers of identified clusters. A set of cluster IDs (e.g., 343) can be used to summarize (335) the spending behavior of the entity represented by the entity ID (322), based on the typical spending behavior of the respective clusters. In one example, two cluster solutions are obtained; one of the cluster solutions has 17 clusters, which classify the entities in a relatively coarse manner; and the other cluster solution has 55 clusters, which classify the entities in a relative fine manner. A cardholder can be identified by the spending behavior of one of the 17 clusters and one of the 55 clusters in which the cardholder is located. Thus, the set of cluster IDs corresponding to the set of cluster solutions provides a hierarchical identification of an entity among clusters of different levels of resolution. The spending behavior of the clusters is represented by the cluster definitions (333), such as the parameters (e.g., variable values) that define the centroids of the clusters.
In one embodiment, the random variables (e.g., 313 and 315) as defined by the definitions (309) have certain degrees of correlation and are not independent from each other. For example, merchants of different merchant categories (e.g., 306) may have overlapping business, or have certain business relationships. For example, certain products and/or services of certain merchants have cause and effect relationships. For example, certain products and/or services of certain merchants are mutually exclusive to a certain degree (e.g., a purchase from one merchant may have a level of probability to exclude the user (101) from making a purchase from another merchant). Such relationships may be complex and difficult to quantify by merely inspecting the categories. Further, such relationships may shift over time as the economy changes.
In one embodiment, a factor analysis (327) is performed to reduce the redundancy and/or correlation among the variables (e.g., 313, 315). The factor analysis (327) identifies the definitions (331) for factors, each of which represents a combination of the variables (e.g., 313, 315).
In one embodiment, a factor is a linear combination of a plurality of the aggregated measurements (e.g., variables (313, 315)) determined for various areas (e.g., merchants or merchant categories, products or product categories). Once the relationship between the factors and the aggregated measurements is determined via factor analysis, the values for the factors can be determined from the linear combinations of the aggregated measurements and be used in a transaction profile (127 or 341) to provide information on the behavior of the entity represented by the entity ID (e.g., an account, an individual, a family).
Once the factor definitions (331) are obtained from the factor analysis (327), the factor definitions (331) can be applied to the variable values (321) to determine factor values (344) for the aggregated spending profile (341). Since redundancy and correlation are reduced in the factors, the number of factors is typically much smaller than the number of the original variables (e.g., 313, 315). Thus, the factor values (344) represent the concise summary of the original variables (e.g., 313, 315).
For example, there may be thousands of variables on spending frequency and amount for different merchant categories; and the factor analysis (327) can reduce the factor number to less than one hundred (and even less than twenty). In one example, a twelve-factor solution is obtained, which allows the use of twelve factors to combine the thousands of the original variables (313, 315); and thus, the spending behavior in thousands of merchant categories can be summarized via twelve factor values (344). In one embodiment, each factor is combination of at least four variables; and a typical variable has contributions to more than one factor.
In one example, hundreds or thousands of transaction records (301) of a cardholder are converted into hundreds or thousands of variable values (321) for various merchant categories, which are summarized (335) via the factor definitions (331) and cluster definitions (333) into twelve factor values (344) and one or two cluster IDs (e.g., 343). The summarized data can be readily interpreted by a human to ascertain the spending behavior of the cardholder. A user (101) may easily specify a spending behavior requirement formulated based on the factor values (344) and the cluster IDs (e.g., to query for a segment of customers, or to request the targeting of a segment of customers). The reduced size of the summarized data reduces the need for data communication bandwidth for communicating the spending behavior of the cardholder over a network connection and allows simplified processing and utilization of the data representing the spending behavior of the cardholder.
In one embodiment, the behavior and characteristics of the clusters are studied to identify a description of a type of representative entities that are found in each of the clusters. The clusters can be named based on the type of representative entities to allow an ordinary person to easily understand the typical behavior of the clusters.
In one embodiment, the behavior and characteristics of the factors are also studied to identify dominant aspects of each factor. The clusters can be named based on the dominant aspects to allow an ordinary person to easily understand the meaning of a factor value.
In FIG. 2, an aggregated spending profile (341) for an entity represented by an entity ID (e.g., 322) includes the cluster ID (343) and factor values (344) determined based on the cluster definitions (333) and the factor definitions (331). The aggregated spending profile (341) may further include other statistical parameters, such as diversity index (342), channel distribution (345), category distribution (346), zip code (347), etc., as further discussed below.
In one embodiment, the diversity index (342) may include an entropy value and/or a Gini coefficient, to represent the diversity of the spending by the entity represented by the entity ID (322) across different areas (e.g., different merchant categories (e.g., 306)). When the diversity index (342) indicates that the diversity of the spending data is under a predetermined threshold level, the variable values (e.g., 323, 324, . . . , 325) for the corresponding entity ID (322) may be excluded from the cluster analysis (329) and/or the factor analysis (327) due to the lack of diversity. When the diversity index (342) of the aggregated spending profile (341) is lower than a predetermined threshold, the factor values (344) and the cluster ID (343) may not accurately represent the spending behavior of the corresponding entity.
In one embodiment, the channel distribution (345) includes a set of percentage values that indicate the percentages of amounts spent in different purchase channels, such as online, via phone, in a retail store, etc.
In one embodiment, the category distribution (346) includes a set of percentage values that indicate the percentages of spending amounts in different super categories (311). In one embodiment, thousands of different merchant categories (e.g., 306) are represented by Merchant Category Codes (MCC), or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes in transaction records (301). These merchant categories (e.g., 306) are classified or combined into less than one hundred super categories (or less than twenty). In one example, fourteen super categories are defined based on domain knowledge.
In one embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) includes the aggregated measurements (e.g., frequency, average spending amount) determined for a set of predefined, mutually exclusive merchant categories (e.g., super categories (311)). Each of the super merchant categories represents a type of products or services a customer may purchase. A transaction profile (127 or 341) may include the aggregated measurements for each of the set of mutually exclusive merchant categories. The aggregated measurements determined for the predefined, mutually exclusive merchant categories can be used in transaction profiles (127 or 341) to provide information on the behavior of a respective entity (e.g., an account, an individual, or a family).
In one embodiment, the zip code (347) in the aggregated spending profile (341) represents the dominant geographic area in which the spending associated with the entity ID (322) occurred. Alternatively or in combination, the aggregated spending profile (341) may include a distribution of transaction amounts over a set of zip codes that account for a majority of the transactions or transaction amounts (e.g., 90%).
In one embodiment, the factor analysis (327) and cluster analysis (329) are used to summarize the spending behavior across various areas, such as different merchants characterized by merchant category (306), different products and/or services, different consumers, etc. The aggregated spending profile (341) may include more or fewer fields than those illustrated in FIG. 2. For example, in one embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) further includes an aggregated spending amount for a period of time (e.g., the past twelve months); in another embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) does not include the category distribution (346); and in a further embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) may include a set of distance measures to the centroids of the clusters. The distance measures may be defined based on the variable values (323, 324, . . . , 325), or based on the factor values (344). The factor values of the centroids of the clusters may be estimated based on the entity ID (e.g., 322) that is closest to the centroid in the respective cluster.
Other variables can be used in place of, or in additional to, the variables (311, 313, 315) illustrated in FIG. 2. For example, the aggregated spending profile (341) can be generated using variables measuring shopping radius/distance from the primary address of the account holder to the merchant site for offline purchases. When such variables are used, the transaction patterns can be identified based at least in part on clustering according to shopping radius/distance and geographic regions. Similarly, the factor definition (331) may include the consideration of the shopping radius/distance. For example, the transaction records (301) may be aggregated based on the ranges of shopping radius/distance and/or geographic regions. For example, the factor analysis can be used to determine factors that naturally combine geographical areas based on the correlations in the spending patterns in various geographical areas.
In one embodiment, the aggregation (317) may involve the determination of a deviation from a trend or pattern. For example, an account makes a certain number of purchases a week at a merchant over the past 6 months. However, in the past 2 weeks the number of purchases is less than the average number per week. A measurement of the deviation from the trend or pattern can be used (e.g., in a transaction profile (127 or 341) as a parameter, or in variable definitions (309) for the factor analysis (327) and/or the cluster analysis) to define the behavior of an account, an individual, a family, etc.
 FIG. 3 shows a method to generate an aggregated spending profile according to one embodiment. In FIG. 3, computation models are established (351) for variables (e.g., 311, 313, and 315). In one embodiment, the variables are defined in a way to capture certain aspects of the spending statistics, such as frequency, amount, etc.
In FIG. 3, data from related accounts are combined (353). For example, when an account number change has occurred for a cardholder in the time period under analysis, the transaction records (301) under the different account numbers of the same cardholder are combined under one account number that represents the cardholder. For example, when the analysis is performed at a person level (or family level, business level, social group level, city level, or region level), the transaction records (301) in different accounts of the person (or family, business, social group, city or region) can be combined under one entity ID (322) that represents the person (or family, business, social group, city or region).
In one embodiment, recurrent/installment transactions are combined (355). For example, multiple monthly payments may be combined and considered as one single purchase.
In FIG. 3, account data are selected (357) according to a set of criteria related to activity, consistency, diversity, etc.
For example, when a cardholder uses a credit card solely to purchase gas, the diversity of the transactions by the cardholder is low. In such a case, the transactions in the account of the cardholder may not be statistically meaningful to represent the spending pattern of the cardholder in various merchant categories. Thus, in one embodiment, if the diversity of the transactions associated with an entity ID (322) is below a threshold, the variable values (e.g., 323, 324, . . . , 325) corresponding to the entity ID (322) are not used in the cluster analysis (329) and/or the factor analysis (327). The diversity can be examined based on the diversity index (342) (e.g., entropy or Gini coefficient), or based on counting the different merchant categories in the transactions associated with the entity ID (322); and when the count of different merchant categories is fewer than a threshold (e.g., 5), the transactions associated with the entity ID (322) are not used in the cluster analysis (329) and/or the factor analysis (327) due to the lack of diversity.
For example, when a cardholder uses a credit card only sporadically (e.g., when running out of cash), the limited transactions by the cardholder may not be statistically meaningful in representing the spending behavior of the cardholder. Thus, in one embodiment, when the numbers of transactions associated with an entity ID (322) is below a threshold, the variable values (e.g., 323, 324, . . . , 325) corresponding to the entity ID (322) are not used in the cluster analysis (329) and/or the factor analysis (327).
For example, when a cardholder has only used a credit card during a portion of the time period under analysis, the transaction records (301) during the time period may not reflect the consistent behavior of the cardholder for the entire time period. Consistency can be checked in various ways. In one example, if the total number of transactions during the first and last months of the time period under analysis is zero, the transactions associated with the entity ID (322) are inconsistent in the time period and thus are not used in the cluster analysis (329) and/or the factor analysis (327). Other criteria can be formulated to detect inconsistency in the transactions.
In FIG. 3, the computation models (e.g., as represented by the variable definitions (309)) are applied (359) to the remaining account data (e.g., transaction records (301)) to obtain data samples for the variables. The data points associated with the entities, other than those whose transactions fail to meet the minimum requirements for activity, consistency, diversity, etc., are used in factor analysis (327) and cluster analysis (329).
In FIG. 3, the data samples (e.g., variable values (321)) are used to perform (361) factor analysis (327) to identify factor solutions (e.g., factor definitions (331)). The factor solutions can be adjusted (363) to improve similarity in factor values of different sets of transaction data (109). For example, factor definitions (331) can be applied to the transactions in the time period under analysis (e.g., the past twelve months) and be applied separately to the transactions in a prior time period (e.g., the twelve months before the past twelve months) to obtain two sets of factor values. The factor definitions (331) can be adjusted to improve the correlation between the two set of factor values.
The data samples can also be used to perform (365) cluster analysis (329) to identify cluster solutions (e.g., cluster definitions (333)). The cluster solutions can be adjusted (367) to improve similarity in cluster identifications based on different sets of transaction data (109). For example, cluster definitions (333) can be applied to the transactions in the time period under analysis (e.g., the past twelve months) and be applied separately to the transactions in a prior time period (e.g., the twelve months before the past twelve months) to obtain two sets of cluster identifications for various entities. The cluster definitions (333) can be adjusted to improve the correlation between the two set of cluster identifications.
In one embodiment, the number of clusters is determined from clustering analysis. For example, a set of cluster seeds can be initially identified and used to run a known clustering algorithm. The sizes of data points in the clusters are then examined. When a cluster contains less than a predetermined number of data points, the cluster may be eliminated to rerun the clustering analysis.
In one embodiment, standardizing entropy is added to the cluster solution to obtain improved results.
In one embodiment, human understandable characteristics of the factors and clusters are identified (369) to name the factors and clusters. For example, when the spending behavior of a cluster appears to be the behavior of an internet loyalist, the cluster can be named âinternet loyalistâ such that if a cardholder is found to be in the âinternet loyalistâ cluster, the spending preferences and patterns of the cardholder can be easily perceived.
In one embodiment, the factor analysis (327) and the cluster analysis (329) are performed periodically (e.g., once a year, or six months) to update the factor definitions (331) and the cluster definitions (333), which may change as the economy and the society change over time.
In FIG. 3, transaction data (109) are summarized (371) using the factor solutions and cluster solutions to generate the aggregated spending profile (341). The aggregated spending profile (341) can be updated more frequently than the factor solutions and cluster solutions, when the new transaction data (109) becomes available. For example, the aggregated spending profile (341) may be updated quarterly or monthly.
Various tweaks and adjustments can be made for the variables (e.g., 313, 315) used for the factor analysis (327) and the cluster analysis (329). For example, the transaction records (301) may be filtered, weighted or constrained, according to different rules to improve the capabilities of the aggregated measurements in indicating certain aspects of the spending behavior of the customers.
For example, in one embodiment, the variables (e.g., 313, 315) are normalized and/or standardized (e.g., using statistical average, mean, and/or variance).
For example, the variables (e.g., 313, 315) for the aggregated measurements can be tuned, via filtering and weighting, to predict the future trend of spending behavior (e.g., for advertisement selection), to identify abnormal behavior (e.g., for fraud prevention), or to identify a change in spending pattern (e.g., for advertisement audience measurement), etc. The aggregated measurements, the factor values (344), and/or the cluster ID (343) generated from the aggregated measurements can be used in a transaction profile (127 or 341) to define the behavior of an account, an individual, a family, etc.
In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) are aged to provide more weight to recent data than older data. In other embodiments, the transaction data (109) are reverse aged. In further embodiments, the transaction data (109) are seasonally adjusted.
In one embodiment, the variables (e.g., 313, 315) are constrained to eliminate extreme outliers. For example, the minimum values and the maximum values of the spending amounts (315) may be constrained based on values at certain percentiles (e.g., the value at one percentile as the minimum and the value at 99 percentile as the maximum) and/or certain predetermined values. In one embodiment, the spending frequency variables (313) are constrained based on values at certain percentiles and median values. For example, the minimum value for a spending frequency variable (313) may be constrained at P1âkÃ(MâP1), where P1 is the one percentile value, M the median value, and k a predetermined constant (e.g., 0.1). For example, the maximum value for a spending frequency variable (313) may be constrained at P99+aÃ(P99âM), where P99 is the 99 percentile value, M the median value, and k a predetermined constant (e.g., 0.1).
In one embodiment, variable pruning is performed to reduce the number of variables (e.g., 313, 315) that have less impact on cluster solutions and/or factor solutions. For example, variables with standard variation less than a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.1) may be discarded for the purpose of cluster analysis (329). For example, analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be performed to identify and remove variables that are no more significant than a predetermined threshold.
The aggregated spending profile (341) can provide information on spending behavior for various application areas, such as marketing, fraud detection and prevention, creditworthiness assessment, loyalty analytics, targeting of offers, etc.
For example, clusters can be used to optimize offers for various groups within an advertisement campaign. The use of factors and clusters to target advertisement can improve the speed of producing targeting models. For example, using variables based on factors and clusters (and thus eliminating the need to use a large number of convention variables) can improve predictive models and increase efficiency of targeting by reducing the number of variables examined. The variables formulated based on factors and/or clusters can be used with other variables to build predictive models based on spending behaviors.
In one embodiment, the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used to monitor risks in transactions. Factor values are typically consistent over time for each entity. An abrupt change in some of the factor values may indicate a change in financial conditions, or a fraudulent use of the account. Models formulated using factors and clusters can be used to identify a series of transactions that do not follow a normal pattern specified by the factor values (344) and/or the cluster ID (343). Potential bankruptcies can be predicted by analyzing the change of factor values over time; and significant changes in spending behavior may be detected to stop and/or prevent fraudulent activities.
For example, the factor values (344) can be used in regression models and/or neural network models for the detection of certain behaviors or patterns. Since factors are relatively non-collinear, the factors can work well as independent variables. For example, factors and clusters can be used as independent variables in tree models.
For example, surrogate accounts can be selected for the construction of a quasi-control group. For example, for a given account A that is in one cluster, the account B that is closest to the account A in the same cluster can be selected as a surrogate account of the account B. The closeness can be determined by certain values in the aggregated spending profile (341), such as factor values (344), category distribution (346), etc. For example, a Euclidian distance defined based on the set of values from the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used to compare the distances between the accounts. Once identified, the surrogate account can be used to reduce or eliminate bias in measurements. For example, to determine the effect of an advertisement, the spending pattern response of the account A that is exposed to the advertisement can be compared to the spending pattern response of the account B that is not exposed to the advertisement.
For example, the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used in segmentation and/or filtering analysis, such as selecting cardholders having similar spending behaviors identified via factors and/or clusters for targeted advertisement campaigns, and selecting and determining a group of merchants that could be potentially marketed towards cardholders originating in a given cluster (e.g., for bundled offers). For example, a query interface can be provided to allow the query to identify a targeted population based on a set of criteria formulated using the values of clusters and factors.
For example, the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used in a spending comparison report, such as comparing a sub-population of interest against the overall population, determining how cluster distributions and mean factor values differ, and building reports for merchants and/or issuers for benchmarking purposes. For example, reports can be generated according to clusters in an automated way for the merchants. For example, the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used in geographic reports by identifying geographic areas where cardholders shop most frequently and comparing predominant spending locations with cardholder residence locations.
In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) provides affinity relationship data in the transaction profiles (127) so that the transaction profiles (127) can be shared with business partners without compromising the privacy of the users (101) and the transaction details.
For example, in one embodiment, the profile generator (121) is to identify clusters of entities (e.g., accounts, cardholders, families, businesses, cities, regions, etc.) based on the spending patterns of the entities. The clusters represent entity segments identified based on the spending patterns of the entities reflected in the transaction data (109) or the transaction records (301).
In one embodiment, the clusters correspond to cells or regions in the mathematical space that contain the respective groups of entities. For example, the mathematical space representing the characteristics of users (101) may be divided into clusters (cells or regions). For example, the cluster analysis (329) may identify one cluster in the cell or region that contains a cluster of entity IDs (e.g., 322) in the space having a plurality of dimensions corresponding to the variables (e.g., 313 and 315). For example, a cluster can also be identified as a cell or region in a space defined by the factors using the factor definitions (331) generated from the factor analysis (327).
In one embodiment, the parameters used in the aggregated spending profile (341) can be used to define a segment or a cluster of entities. For example, a value for the cluster ID (343) and a set of ranges for the factor values (344) and/or other values can be used to define a segment.
In one embodiment, a set of clusters are standardized to represent the predilection of entities in various groups for certain products or services. For example, a set of standardized clusters can be formulated for people who have shopped, for example, at home improvement stores. The cardholders in the same cluster have similar spending behavior.
In one embodiment, the tendency or likelihood of a user (101) being in a particular cluster (i.e. the user's affinity to the cell) can be characterized using a value, based on past purchases. The same user (101) may have different affinity values for different clusters.
For example, a set of affinity values can be computed for an entity, based on the transaction records (301), to indicate the closeness or predilection of the entity to the set of standardized clusters. For example, a cardholder who has a first value representing affinity of the cardholder to a first cluster may have a second value representing affinity of the cardholder to a second cluster. For example, if a consumer buys a lot of electronics, the affinity value of the consumer to the electronics cluster is high.
In one embodiment, other indicators are formulated across the merchant community and cardholder behavior and provided in the profile (e.g., 127 or 341) to indicate the risk of a transaction.
In one embodiment, the relationship of a pair of values from two different clusters provides an indication of the likelihood that the user (101) is in one of the two cells, if the user (101) is shown to be in the other cell. For example, if the likelihood of the user (101) to purchase each of two types of products is known, the scores can be used to determine the likelihood of the user (101) buying one of the two types of products if the user (101) is known to be interested in the other type of products. In one embodiment, a map of the values for the clusters is used in a profile (e.g., 127 or 341) to characterize the spending behavior of the user (101) (or other types of entities, such as a family, company, neighborhood, city, or other types of groups defined by other aggregate parameters, such as time of day, etc.).
In one embodiment, the clusters and affinity information are standardized to allow sharing between business partners, such as transaction processing organizations, search providers, and marketers. Purchase statistics and search statistics are generally described in different ways. For example, purchase statistics are based on merchants, merchant categories, SKU numbers, product descriptions, etc.; and search statistics are based on search terms. Once the clusters are standardized, the clusters can be used to link purchase information based merchant categories (and/or SKU numbers, product descriptions) with search information based on search terms. Thus, search predilection and purchase predilection can be mapped to each other.
In one embodiment, the purchase data and the search data (or other third party data) are correlated based on mapping to the standardized clusters (cells or segments). The purchase data and the search data (or other third party data) can be used together to provide benefits or offers (e.g., coupons) to consumers. For example, standardized clusters can be used as a marketing tool to provide relevant benefits, including coupons, statement credits, or the like to consumers who are within or are associated with common clusters. For example, a data exchange apparatus may obtain cluster data based on consumer search engine data and actual payment transaction data to identify like groups of individuals who may respond favorably to particular types of benefits, such as coupons and statement credits.
Details about aggregated spending profile (341) in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/777,173, filed May 10, 2010, assigned Pub. No. 2010/0306032, and entitled âSystems and Methods to Summarize Transaction Data,â the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Transaction Data Based Portal
In FIG. 1, the transaction terminal (105) initiates the transaction for a user (101) (e.g., a customer) for processing by a transaction handler (103). The transaction handler (103) processes the transaction and stores transaction data (109) about the transaction, in connection with account data (111), such as the account profile of an account of the user (101). The account data (111) may further include data about the user (101), collected from issuers or merchants, and/or other sources, such as social networks, credit bureaus, merchant provided information, address information, etc. In one embodiment, a transaction may be initiated by a server (e.g., based on a stored schedule for recurrent payments).
Over a period of time, the transaction handler (103) accumulates the transaction data (109) from transactions initiated at different transaction terminals (e.g., 105) for different users (e.g., 101). The transaction data (109) thus includes information on purchases made by various users (e.g., 101) at various times via different purchases options (e.g., online purchase, offline purchase from a retail store, mail order, order via phone, etc.)
In one embodiment, the accumulated transaction data (109) and the corresponding account data (111) are used to generate intelligence information about the purchase behavior, pattern, preference, tendency, frequency, trend, amount and/or propensity of the users (e.g., 101), as individuals or as a member of a group. The intelligence information can then be used to generate, identify and/or select targeted advertisements for presentation to the user (101) on the point of interaction (107), during a transaction, after a transaction, or when other opportunities arise.
 FIG. 4 shows a system to provide information based on transaction data (109) according to one embodiment. In FIG. 4, the transaction handler (103) is coupled between an issuer processor (145) and an acquirer processor (147) to facilitate authorization and settlement of transactions between a consumer account (146) and a merchant account (148). The transaction handler (103) records the transactions in the data warehouse (149). The portal (143) is coupled to the data warehouse (149) to provide information based on the transaction records (301), such as the transaction profiles (127) or aggregated spending profile (341). The portal (143) may be implemented as a web portal, a telephone gateway, a file/data server, etc.
In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to receive queries identifying search criteria from the profile selector (129), the advertisement selector (133) and/or third parties and in response, to provide transaction-based intelligence requested by the queries.
For example, in one embodiment, a query is to specify a plurality of account holders to request the portal (143) to deliver the transaction profiles (127) of account holders in a batch mode.
For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify the user (101) to request the user specific profile (131), or the aggregated spending profile (341), of the user (101). The user (101) may be identified using the account data (111), such as the account number (302), or the user data (125) such as browser cookie ID, IP address, etc.
For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify a retail location; and the portal (143) is to provide a profile (e.g., 341) that summarizes the aggregated spending patterns of users who have shopped at the retail location within a period of time.
For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify a geographical location; and the portal (143) is to provide a profile (e.g., 341) that summarizes the aggregated spending patterns of users who have been to, or who are expected to visit, the geographical location within a period of time (e.g., as determined or predicted based on the locations of the point of interactions (e.g., 107) of the users).

In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) is to provide an advertisement to the user (101), or to provide information derived from the transaction data (109) to the user (101).
In one embodiment, an advertisement is a marketing interaction which may include an announcement and/or an offer of a benefit, such as a discount, incentive, reward, coupon, gift, cash back, or opportunity (e.g., special ticket/admission). An advertisement may include an offer of a product or service, an announcement of a product or service, or a presentation of a brand of products or services, or a notice of events, facts, opinions, etc. The advertisements can be presented in text, graphics, audio, video, or animation, and as printed matter, web content, interactive media, etc. An advertisement may be presented in response to the presence of a financial transaction card, or in response to a financial transaction card being used to make a financial transaction, or in response to other user activities, such as browsing a web page, submitting a search request, communicating online, entering a wireless communication zone, etc. In one embodiment, the presentation of advertisements may be not a result of a user action.
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) can be one of various endpoints of the transaction network, such as point of sale (POS) terminals, automated teller machines (ATMs), electronic kiosks (or computer kiosks or interactive kiosks), self-assist checkout terminals, vending machines, gas pumps, websites of banks (e.g., issuer banks or acquirer banks of credit cards), bank statements (e.g., credit card statements), websites of the transaction handler (103), websites of merchants, checkout websites or web pages for online purchases, etc.
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be the same as the transaction terminal (105), such as a point of sale (POS) terminal, an automated teller machine (ATM), a mobile phone, a computer of the user for an online transaction, etc. In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be co-located with, or near, the transaction terminal (105) (e.g., a video monitor or display, a digital sign), or produced by the transaction terminal (e.g., a receipt produced by the transaction terminal (105)). In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be separate from and not co-located with the transaction terminal (105), such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a personal computer of the user, a voice mail box of the user, an email inbox of the user, a digital sign, etc.
For example, the advertisements can be presented on a portion of media for a transaction with the customer, which portion might otherwise be unused and thus referred to as a âwhite spaceâ herein. A white space can be on a printed matter (e.g., a receipt printed for the transaction, or a printed credit card statement), on a video display (e.g., a display monitor of a POS terminal for a retail transaction, an ATM for cash withdrawal or money transfer, a personal computer of the customer for online purchases), or on an audio channel (e.g., an interactive voice response (IVR) system for a transaction over a telephonic device).
In one embodiment, the white space is part of a media channel available to present a message from the transaction handler (103) in connection with the processing of a transaction of the user (101). In one embodiment, the white space is in a media channel that is used to report information about a transaction of the user (101), such as an authorization status, a confirmation message, a verification message, a user interface to verify a password for the online use of the account information (142), a monthly statement, an alert or a report, or a web page provided by the portal (143) to access a loyalty program associated with the consumer account (146) or a registration program.
In other embodiments, the advertisements can also be presented via other media channels which may not involve a transaction processed by the transaction handler (103). For example, the advertisements can be presented on publications or announcements (e.g., newspapers, magazines, books, directories, radio broadcasts, television, digital signage, etc., which may be in an electronic form, or in a printed or painted form). The advertisements may be presented on paper, on websites, on billboards, on digital signs, or on audio portals.
In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) purchases the rights to use the media channels from the owner or operators of the media channels and uses the media channels as advertisement spaces. For example, white spaces at a point of interaction (e.g., 107) with customers for transactions processed by the transaction handler (103) can be used to deliver advertisements relevant to the customers conducting the transactions; and the advertisement can be selected based at least in part on the intelligence information derived from the accumulated transaction data (109) and/or the context at the point of interaction (107) and/or the transaction terminal (105).
In general, a point of interaction (e.g., 107) may or may not be capable of receiving inputs from the customers, and may or may not co-located with a transaction terminal (e.g., 105) that initiates the transactions. The white spaces for presenting the advertisement on the point of interaction (107) may be on a portion of a geographical display space (e.g., on a screen), or on a temporal space (e.g., in an audio stream).
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be used to primarily to access services not provided by the transaction handler (103), such as services provided by a search engine, a social networking website, an online marketplace, a blog, a news site, a television program provider, a radio station, a satellite, a publisher, etc.
In one embodiment, a consumer device is used as the point of interaction (107), which may be a non-portable consumer device or a portable computing device. The consumer device is to provide media content to the user (101) and may receive input from the user (101).
Examples of non-portable consumer devices include a computer terminal, a television set, a personal computer, a set-top box, or the like. Examples of portable consumer devices include a portable computer, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a security card, a wireless terminal, or the like. The consumer device may be implemented as a data processing system as illustrated in FIG. 7, with more or fewer components.
In one embodiment, the consumer device includes an account identification device (141). For example, a smart card used as an account identification device (141) is integrated with a mobile phone, or a personal digital assistant (PDA).
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) is integrated with a transaction terminal (105). For example, a self-service checkout terminal includes a touch pad to interact with the user (101); and an ATM machine includes a user interface subsystem to interact with the user (101).

In one embodiment, the inter-connect (171) includes one or more buses connected to one another through various bridges, controllers and/or adapters. In one embodiment the I/O controllers (177) include a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals, and/or an IEEE-1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE-1394 peripherals.
In one embodiment, the memory (167) includes one or more of: ROM (Read Only Memory), volatile RAM (Random Access Memory), and non-volatile memory, such as hard drive, flash memory, etc.
Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non-volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive, a magnetic optical drive, an optical drive (e.g., a DVD RAM), or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non-volatile memory may also be a random access memory.
The non-volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non-volatile memory that is remote from the system, such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface, can also be used.
In this description, some functions and operations are described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However, such expressions are also used to specify that the functions result from execution of the code/instructions by a processor, such as a microprocessor.
Alternatively, or in combination, the functions and operations as described here can be implemented using special purpose circuitry, with or without software instructions, such as using Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions, or in combination with software instructions. Thus, the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
While one embodiment can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems, various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer-readable media used to actually effect the distribution.
At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache or a remote storage device.
Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions referred to as âcomputer programs.â The computer programs typically include one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer, cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.
A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory and/or cache. Portions of this software and/or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further, the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and/or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively, portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically, just in time, when needed for execution. Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.
Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), etc.), among others. The computer-readable media may store the instructions.
The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. However, propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.
In general, a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and/or transmits) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).
In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
