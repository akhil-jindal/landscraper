 FIG. 3 is an initial screen displayed on the terminal according to the invention. Assuming that the display module 241 is realized as a touch screen, the embodiment will be described.
On an initial screen may be displayed a current date, family schedules and a current weather. Storage states of the current stored goods in the refrigerator are displayed on the right of such information.
Menu icons 330 displaying various menus are arranged on a lower area of the screen of the display module 241 constituting the terminal 200. When the user touches one of the menu icons 330, information related to the touched menu will be displayed on the screen.
The user uses such the menu icons 330 in selecting various menus such as memo board management, electric bill management, electricity information management and schedule management.
According to this embodiment, when the user pushed a menu icon displaying รขยยEcoรขยย, a screen shown in FIG. 4 is displayed. In this instance, the icon displaying รขยยEcoรขยย is related to energy usage information of the refrigerator.
 FIG. 4 illustrates a state displaying power consumption of the refrigerator and the other electric appliances, the sum total, electric charge information and an operational state of the refrigerator.
In this instance, a preset control icon 400 that is predeterminedly draggable to control the operational state of the refrigerator may be provided on an upper left area of the screen. The control icon 400 may be movable along a moving passage 410 provided to guide the movement of the control icon 400.
An end of the moving passage 410 refers to Power Saver of the refrigerator and the other end refers to High Performance.
As shown in FIG. 5, when the user moves the control icon 400 to the end of the moving passage 410 by touch and drag, the refrigerator is operated to lower the power consumption of the refrigerator.
Accordingly, a target temperature of the storage compartments (the freezer and refrigerator compartments) displayed lower than the control icon and the moving passage on the state displaying window 420 of the refrigerator may be increased than before.
To achieve such a target temperature, an operation factor of the compressor (310, see FIG. 2) is lowered than before or an operation frequency thereof is decreased.
As shown in FIG. 6, when the user moves the control icon 400 to the other end of the moving passage 410 by touch and drag, the refrigerator is operated to increase the power consumption and a target temperature of the storage compartments (the refrigerator and freezer compartments) displayed on the state display window 420 of the refrigerator is lowered than before.
To achieve such a target temperature, an operation factor or an operation factor of the compressor (310, see FIG. 2) is increased.
A current state of the compressor is displayed on the state display window 420 and operation state change of the compressor generated by the operation of the control icon 410 is displayed on the state display window 420.
An electricity information display window 430 is provided on a predetermined lower area of the state display window 420. The electricity information display window 430 includes a graph display part 431 displaying change in the electric charge in a graph, a color display window 432 and a power consumption display window 433 displaying the entire power consumption of the house and the power consumption of each electric appliance.
As shown in FIG. 7, a change graph 431 a of the actual power consumption (or the actual electric charge) of the house is displayed on the graph display part 431. A graph 431 b showing change in an average value of the electric power consumed by the houses supplied the electric power by an electric power company or an electric service company is displayed on the graph display part 431.
A vertical straight line of the graph display part 431 is a time display line 500 referring to the current time.
The change graph 431 b of the average value of the electric power (or the electric charge) consumed by the houses is provided by the electric power company or the electric service company as mentioned above. Moderation of the power consumption in the house may be determined based on the average of the electric power consumed by the houses.
Accordingly, the average of the electric power consumed by the houses (or the electric charges) is referenced to as a first reference power consumption (or a first reference electric charge).
In this instance, the first reference power consumption (or the first reference electric charge) provided by the electric power company is not fixed but differentiated every day. The average reference power consumption (or the first reference electric charge) may be a value differentiated based on time according to the power demand.
On the screen of the display module (241, see FIG. 6) may be overlapped an actual power consumption (or actual electric charge) graph 431 a with the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge) graph 431 b, to enable the user to compare them with each other at a glance.
Meanwhile, a reference line 600 is horizontally provided on the graph and the reference line 600 may be a second reference power consumption (or second reference electric charge) set by the user or the electric power company. It may be defined that a higher section is a high electric bill section with respect to the reference line. In other words, the higher section is a section where the electric bill is remarkably high.
The comparison between the actual power consumption (or electric charge) and the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge) is relative comparison between the user's house and the other houses using the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge).
When comparing his or her house with the other houses, the user can recognize his or her power consumption pattern.
However, the second reference power consumption (or second reference electric charge) enables the user to set a usage target of the actual power consumption (or actual electric charge).
Accordingly, when comparing such the second reference power consumption (or second reference electric power) with the actual power consumption (or actual electric charge), the user can check his or her current electricity usage pattern and follow the target usage. If the actual power consumption is over the set reference value, the user may be motivated to reduce the excess value by his or her selecting.
In this instance, the high electric bill section is defined as a section exceeding the reference line 600. Accordingly, the reference line 600 may be a lower limit of the high electric bill section.
In other words, the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge) provides a kind of a relative reference and the second reference power consumption (or second reference electric charge) provides a kind of an absolute reference.
Adjacent to the graph display part 431 may be provided the color display window 432. The color display window 432 may be a streetlamp type having a red window 432 a, a yellow window 432 b and a green window 432 c.  
The reason why the streetlamp type color window is provided is to give a user a notice if the current power consumption (or electric charge) is exceeding, in the same range or not up to the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge).
Also, the result of the comparison between the actual power consumption (or the actual electric charge) and the second reference power consumption (or second reference electric charge0 may be displayed on the color display window 432.
Under the configuration mentioned above, a flow chart of controlling the refrigerator according to the moving of the control icon will be described in reference to FIG. 8.
First of all, information on the power consumption of the refrigerator and states of the component parts (such as the compressor and an ice maker) may be displayed on the display part provided in the display module (S801).
In that state, it is determined whether there is input for changing an operation mode of the refrigerator. The input for changing the operation mode means that the user drops the touched finger after changing the position of the control icon on the moving passage by touch and drag (S802).
When it is determined that there is change in the position of the control icon to change the operation mode, it is determined that whether the change in the position of the control icon is related to the increase or decrease of the freezing and refrigerating ability (or power consumption) possessed by the refrigerator (S803).
In this instance, the change in the position of the control icon for increasing the freezing/refrigerating ability of the refrigerator is generated when the user determines that the freezing/refrigerating ability of the refrigerator is exceeding or short of his or her reference.
When the change is related to the increase of the freezing/refrigerating ability of the refrigerator based on the result of the determination, a target temperature of the refrigerator or freezer compartment is set lower. The set target temperature is displayed on the state display window of the display part provided in the display module (S804).
The compression ability such as the operation factor or the operation frequency of the compressor is increased and information related to that is displayed on the state display window (S805).
At the same time, increased expected power consumption is displayed to notify the user of the increased expected power consumption (S806).
In the step of S803, when a control command for decreasing the freezing/refrigerating ability is received, the target temperature of the freezer or refrigerator compartment is set to increase and the set target temperature is displayed on the state display window (S807).
The operation factor or operation frequency of the compressor is set to decrease and the compression ability of the compressor is set to decrease. Such the operation ability of the compressor is displayed on the state display window (S808).
Based on such the control, the power consumption expected to decrease is displayed to enable the user to recognize change in the power consumption (S809).
Meanwhile, as mentioned above, an electricity information display window (430, see FIG. 7) is provided on the display module. In reference to FIG. 9, a control method for displaying states according to change in the actual electric power (or actual electric charge) consumed in the house will be described as follows.
In this instance, the first reference power consumption (or first reference electric charge) and the second reference power consumption (or second reference electric charge) are covered by a reference power consumption (or reference electric charge).
As shown in FIG. 9, the refrigerator is put into operation (S801). Once the electricity starts to be consumed after the refrigerator is put into operation, the current actual power consumption (or actual electric charge) is compared with the reference power consumption (or electric charge) and it is determined whether the actual power consumption is under or in the same range or over the reference power consumption (S802).
If the actual power consumption is under the reference power consumption based on the result of the determination, the green window (432 c, see FIG. 7) provided in the color display window (432, see FIG. 7) is luminous and a green light is emitted outside (S903).
That green light makes the user smoothly recognize that the electricity or the electric charge consumed in his or her house is low, compared with the other houses.
Meanwhile, when the actual power consumption is in the same range based on the result of the determination in S802, the yellow window (432 b, see FIG. 7) of the color display window (432, see FIG. 7) is luminous and a yellow light is noticeable outside (S904).
The same range may be defined to be approximately 95รย100% of the reference power consumption (or reference electric charge) and the embodiment is not limited thereto. The range may be changeable according to a situation.
Accordingly, when the actual power consumption of the house is in a range of 95รย100% with respect to the reference power consumption (or reference electric charge), the light is luminous on the yellow window to provide a kind of warning to the user.
Meanwhile, when the actual power consumption (or actual electric charge) of the house is over the reference power consumption (or reference electric charge) based on the result of the determination performed in S902, a light is luminous from a red window (432 a, see FIG. 7) of the color display window (432, see FIG. 7) and a red light is emitted outside (S905) to notify the user of the excess state (S905).
Accordingly, the user can smoothly recognize that the current electric power consumption state is out of the common electric power consumption.
Meanwhile, when the refrigerator is operated in the power consumption excess state having the red light displayed on the color display window, it is determined whether a power consumption decreasing operation is set based on an electric power management program provided by the electric power company (or electric power service company) to lower the electric bill according to the user's selection (S906).
When the power consumption decreasing operation for the refrigerator is set based on the result of the determination, a command for decreasing the operation factor or operation frequency of the compressor is implemented or a command for decreasing the power consumption when the defrost heater performs a defrosting operation is implemented (S907).
When the power consumption decreasing for the other electric appliances rather than the refrigerator is set based on the result of the determination, each of the other electric appliances is controlled to decrease the current power consumption based on the setting.
In that state, the current actual power consumption (or actual electric charge) is compared with the reference power consumption (or reference electric charge) and the result of the comparison is displayed by the corresponding color light mentioned above.
Meanwhile, an embodiment enabling the user to manage schedules will be described as follows.
As shown in FIG. 10, when the user pushes an icon displaying รขยยCalendarรขยย, a calendar 700 is displayed as shown in FIG. 11.
In the calendar 700, each week forms a single line and approximately 4รย5 weeks may be displayed such that the user may recognize schedules or occasions of approximately one month at a glance.
In this instance, an enlarged frame 720 is displayed on the display module 241 to and display a specific week enlarged in comparison with the other weeks. The enlarged frame 720 may be characterized to be fixed to the corresponding position.
Compared with the enlarged frame 720 having the fixed position, the calendar 700 may be movable horizontally.
When the user touches a specific point and drags the touched point upward or downward, the calendar 700 may be moving along the dragged direction.
According to such drag, a week belonging to the enlarged frame 720 may be changed into another week. The week in the enlarged frame 20 may be enlarged, compared with the other week.
In this instance, when a specific week is displayed in the enlarged frame 720, the week before the specific week is displayed above the enlarged frame 720 and the week after the specific week is displayed under the enlarged frame 720.
A week the current date belongs to may be displayed on the week displayed in the enlarged frame 720 and the current date may be displayed larger than the other dates of the current week or it may be displayed in a different color.
On the calendar 700 may be displayed schedule icons 730 displaying specific schedules or events.
Brief explanation 740 may be displayed next to the schedule icon 730 on the date belonging to the week displayed in the enlarged frame 720.
In contrast, such explanation is hidden on the dates outside the enlarged frame 720 and only the schedule icon 730 may be displayed on the dates outside the enlarged frame 720.
As shown in FIG. 12, the specific week (the (2)nd week in the drawing) is displayed in the enlarged frame 720.
In this instance, the user can drag the touched finger to the enlarged frame 720 in a state of touching another week (the (5)th week in the drawing).
After that, as shown in FIG. 13, the week touched by the finger initially is displayed on the enlarged frame 720 along the finger movement.
At the same time, the week on the enlarged frame 720 may be moved above the enlarged frame 720 and the size of the week is lessened or disappears from the display module 241.
Brief explanation 740 of a hidden event is displayed on a specific date belonging to a new week in the enlarged frame 720, next to a schedule icon 730 displaying a specific event.
Such movement may be identically applied when the user drags a touched point downward.
Meanwhile, when the user touches a specific point and drags the touched point upward or downward, the week before or after the specific week displayed on the enlarged frame 720 may be displayed on the enlarged frame 720 sequentially, regardless of the dragged distance.
In other words, in description related to FIGS. 12 and 13, when the user drags a touched point to the enlarged frame 720 in a state of touching a specific week with the finger, the specific week touched by the finger is moved to the enlarged frame 720 along a locus of the drag.
However, when the user lifts the touched point up or down even slightly, the entire of the calendar 700 is moved and the week in the enlarged frame 720 can be changed.
As shown in FIG. 14, the user may change the schedule planned on a specific date into on another date. Such schedule changing work may be enabled by the user's drag and drop operation smoothly.
Specifically, when changing the schedule planned on October 20 into on October 23, the user drags the schedule icon 730 displayed on October 23 to October 23 in a state of touching it.
The finger is dropped from the dragged schedule icon 730 after moved to October 23, and then the schedule planned on the 20th date is changed into on the 23th date. The changed state is stored.
A situation of the user inputting a new schedule will be described as follows.
First of all, as shown in FIG. 15, the user double touches a desired date.
After that, pluralities of schedule icons 730 are unfolded to display specific schedules, as shown in FIG. 16.
As shown in FIG. 17, a specific one of the schedule icons 730 is touched and selected.
When the specific schedule icon is touched and selected, a touch key board 800 is popped up on the display module 241 to enable the user to record brief comments related to the schedule of the schedule icon 730 as shown in FIG. 18.
The touch key board 800 may be located above the calendar 700.
In other words, even when touch is input during the input using the touch key board 800, the calendar 700 may not be affected.
Accordingly, the user can input brief comments related to the corresponding schedule, using the touch key board 800. The input comments are displayed on the selected date, together with the selected schedule icon 730.
The comments displayed as mentioned above may be displayed outside when they are in the enlarged frame 720. When they are out of the enlarged frame 720 by the user's calendar drag, the comments are hidden.
In reference to FIG. 19, the control for the schedule management in the terminal mentioned above will be described comprehensively as follows.
As shown in FIG. 19, it is determined whether the user operates the display module configured of the touch screen (S1901). If the user operates the display module based on the result of the determination, it is determined which kind of the operation is made by the user (S1902).
If the user drags the touched calendar upward or downward after touching the calendar displayed on the touch screen, the calendar is moved along the drag direction (S1903).
Such movement makes a specific week of the calendar in the current enlarged frame be out of the enlarged frame (S1904). Another week of the calendar located out of the enlarged frame is located in the enlarged frame (S1905).
Meanwhile, the position change of the calendar with respect to the enlarged frame hides the comments on a specific schedule displayed on the calendar out of the enlarged frame (S1906).
The comments related to a specific schedule that is hidden before are displayed outside on the calendar located in the enlarged frame (S1907).
In S1902, when it is determined that the user's operation is dragging icon related to a specific schedule displayed on a specific date, it is determined whether an icon dragged to another date by the user is dropped (S1908).
When the icon is dropped on a completely different date based on the result of the determination, the icon and comments displayed on the former location are deleted (S1909) and an icon. Comments related to the icon are displayed on the dropped date and the displayed comments are stored (S1910).
Meanwhile, in S1902, when the user touches several times (multi-touches) a specific date at preset intervals, a plurality of different icons are displayed on a specific date (S1911).
When the user selects a specific one of the icons by touch, only the selected icon is displayed on the corresponding date and the other icons not selected by the user are controlled to be hidden (S1913, S1914).
When the user selects to record comments related to the selected icon, the touch key board is displayed on the display part of the touch screen to enable the user to record desired comments.
 FIGS. 20 to 26 are diagrams according to a third embodiment related to information transmission/reception and personal schedule management.
 FIG. 20 is a diagram of an initial screen displayed on the terminal 200 according to the invention.
As shown in FIG. 20, on the initial screen may be displayed the current date, family schedules and the current weather. On the right of them may be displayed storage states of the current foods preserved in the refrigerator.
Menu icons 330 displaying various menus are displayed on a lower area of touch screen 210 in the terminal. When the user touches one of the menu icons 330, information related to the selected menu is popped up on the screen.
According to this embodiment, when the user pushes a menu icon displaying รขยยMemo Boardรขยย to open a memo board to store various information and messages, a screen is popped up as shown in FIG. 21.
The menu icon displaying รขยยMemo Boardรขยย may display various information provided outside and provide a passage to provide the displayed information to each of the component parts.
As shown in FIG. 21, when the icon displaying รขยยMemo Boardรขยย is pushed, a new message 350 provided outside is displayed on the display module 241.
A รขยยYesรขยย key 351 and รขยยNoรขยย key 352 are popped up on the new message to enable the user to select whether to store the new message 350 in the memo board.
When the user touches รขยยYesรขยย key 351, the new message 350 is stored in the memo board 440 and the storing is displayed.
To enable the user to recognize the new message 350 smoothly, the new message 350 may be displayed before a former message displayed on the memo board 440.
Meanwhile, the user touches and drags a specific message displayed on the memo board 440 and move the position of the message. After that, the user releases (or drops) the touch state and the message is still at a finally moved position. Accordingly, the initial position of the message may be changed into another position.
A storage folder 500 assigned to each family member may be provided adjacent to the memo board 440. The storage folders 500 may be realized as figures of family members, respectively.
As shown in FIG. 23, each storage folder 500 includes a communication device icon 510 displaying a communication device and a schedule icon 520 displaying a schedule for each family member.
The icons 510 and 520 are hidden in the storage folder 500. When the user touches and drags a message on the memo board 440 near the storage folder 500, the storage folder 500 is open and the icons 510 and 520 are displayed.
When the user touches the storage folder 500 plural times with his or her finger, the icons 510 and 520 may be open aside. That is because the user has to check contents stored in his or her storage folder 500.
According to the third embodiment, only the communication device icon 510 and the schedule icon 520 are provided in the storage folder 500 and the invention is not limited thereto. Icons having other functions may be provided.
The user drags a message or information provided on the memo board 440 to the communication device icon 520. After that, the user drops the dragged message or information. That situation will be described as follows.
As shown in FIG. 24, the message or information dropped by the communication part is transmitted to a communication device, for example, a mobile phone possessed by a family member corresponding to the storage folder 500.
In other words, such the message as SMS is transmitted to the mobile phone by the communication part and the transmitted message is displayed on a screen of the mobile phone possessed by the corresponding family member.
Meanwhile, a specific message of the storage folder 500 is moved and dropped to the communication icon 510, to be transmitted to a specific communication device, or dropped to the schedule icon 520 to be stored in the schedule board.
In this instance, a new message display window 600 is generated on the storage folder 500 and the number of the message dropped to the storage folder 500 is displayed on the new message display window 600.
If a message on the memo board 440 is dragged and dropped to the schedule icon 520 on the screen shown in FIG. 23, a corresponding message is input to a schedule board for a corresponding family member.
The schedule board may be specified to be the same as a schedule list or calendar.
 FIG. 25 illustrates a schedule calendar. When the message dragged and dropped to the schedule icon 520 is related to a specific schedule, a specific schedule may be input to the schedule calendar.
The input schedule may be input as an icon 710 or a simple memo to enable the user to recognize easily.
In reference to FIG. 26, the overall control operation of the invention will be described as follows.
First of all, when receiving a new message or new information via the communication part (S2601), the controller determines whether the user inputs a command of storing such a new message or information in a memo board (S2602).
When the storing command is input based on the result of the determination, the controller controls the new message or information to be displayed on the memo board (S2603).
As mentioned above, a currently new message or information may be displayed in the very front as shown in FIG. 5.
Meanwhile, it is determined whether the message or information displayed on the memo boar is approached to the storage folder assigned to a specific person (S2604).
In this instance, a plurality of icons provided in the storage folder for the specific person may be open and displayed (S2605).
In this instance, the icons include the communication device icon 510 or the schedule icon 520 as shown in FIG. 23. The icons may be personal memo icon or other icons.
It is determined which icon the dragged message or information is dropped to (S2606).
When the dropped icon is the personal memo icon or the schedule icon, the message or information dropped to the personal memo or the schedule board (the schedule list or the schedule calendar) may be stored.
It is determined whether the dropped message or information is related to a specific schedule (S2608).
When it is related to the specific schedule, contents related to the dropped message or information are input to a specific date of the personal schedule board (the schedule list or the schedule calendar) categorized into the dates.
A date or contents written in the message or information may be searched and the contents may be written on the corresponding date on the schedule board (S2609).
Meanwhile, when the dragged message or information is dropped to the communication device icon in S2606, the dropped message or information is transmitted to a corresponding personal communication device and the corresponding user may recognize the contents of the message (S2610).
After the S2609 or S2610, a new message display window is displayed to notice that the new message or information is dropped to a corresponding storage folder and written in the schedule board or personal memo board or it is transmitted to the communication device (S2611).
Through that process, each user recognizes that the new message or information arrives.
Meanwhile, the user touches a button of รขยยSelf-checkรขยย out of the menu icons 330 shown in FIG. 27 to check a normal operation of the refrigerator, a screen shown in FIG. 28 is popped up.
As shown in FIG. 28, an operation state display window is displayed on the display module 241 to display a current state of the refrigerator.
On the operation state display window 445 may be displayed a bar graph to simply display energy consumption, compressor performance and cooling efficiency that are deducted by self check before.
It is easily figured out from the length of the bar graph whether the energy consumption, the compressor performance and the cooling efficiency are normal, exceeding or short.
The last self check date (Aug. 21, 2009 in this embodiment) is displayed on the operation state display window 445.
On a lower area of the operation state display window 445 is displayed a message displaying รขยยDo you check the refrigerator now?รขยย and under the message are displayed a Yes key 445 a and a No key 445 b, such that the self check may be implemented by the user's selecting.
When the Yes key 445 a is pushed on the operation state display window 400, a check result window 450 is displayed as shown in FIG. 29.
When they are operated normally, a message displaying that the component parts are operated normally is popped up.
However, when some of the component parts are in error or deteriorated, an error message or deterioration message like what is shown in FIG. 29 is displayed on the check result window 450.
In this instance, the component part determined to be in error or to have an abnormal ability is displayed on the check result window 450 to enable the user to recognize easily and a graph showing the position of the component is displayed.
On the check result window 450 shown in FIG. 29 may be displayed a message of รขยยCompressor Errorรขยย and รขยยXรขยย to show the compressor is located in an upper portion of the refrigerator.
When the state of the refrigerator is abnormal mentioned above, a message asking whether to connect to the service center to get the repair service is displayed and รขยยYesรขยย key 450 a and รขยยNoรขยย key 450 b are displayed under the message.
When the Yes key 450 a is touched, the nearest service center from the current location is searched on a map 460.
At this time, an enlarged display window 461 is displayed on the map 460 to enlarge and display geographic information near the corresponding service center to notify the user of the location of the service center definitely.
When the nearest service center is searched through the searching process, a repairman list 470 of the nearest service center is displayed as shown in FIG. 31.
On the repairman list 470 are displayed a personal data display window 471 displaying photographs, names and evaluation grades and a schedule display window 472 displaying service schedules of the repairmen.
On the schedule display window 472 are displayed current reservation states of each repairman classified by time and reservation available time (displayed as รขยยAvailableรขยย).
A numeral reference of 473 is a current time displaying line and the user can make reservation of on-site service, in reference to the current time displaying line 473 and the available reservation time of each repairman.
In that state, the user touches a repairman having no service schedule at the desired time on the display module 241 to make a service reservation simply.
In other words, the current time is 11:30 AM and the user desires to have an on-site service about 3:00 PM. In this instance, the user touches an available time (2:30 PMรย4:40 PM) on the schedule display window 432 of the repairman having not service schedules at that time.
As shown in FIG. 32, a reservation window 480 displaying a personal data and a service reservation time of the reserved repairman is displayed together with a message displaying completion of D-reservation.
In reference to the accompanying drawings, overall control flow of the invention related to the self check and the call for the service will be described as follows.
As shown in FIG. 23, the user touches to input a command for the self check and the self check starts (S3301). After that, it is checked whether the refrigerator is operated normally (S3302).
Based on such the self check, it is determined whether the refrigerator is in error or abnormal operation (S3303).
When the refrigerator is in error or abnormal operation based on the result of the determination, a message of such error or abnormal operation is displayed (S3304) and the name and position of the portion or component causing the reason of the error or abnormal operation are displayed (S3305).
It is determined whether the user inputs a service requesting button in that error or abnormal state (S3306).
In this instance, the near or nearest service center is searched and the near or nearest service center is marked on the map displayed on the display module (S3307).
When more than two service centers are marked based on the result of the searching, the user may select one of the service centers (S3308). When the nearest service center is marked based on the result of the searching, such a selecting process may be omitted.
As shown in FIG. 34, a list and available on-site service times of repairmen are displayed (S3401).
Once the user inputs a specific repairman and a corresponding available on-site service time (S3402, S3403), a message of service reservation completion is displayed on the display module (S3404).
 FIG. 35 illustrates another embodiment of the control method according to the invention. A self check starts by the user's touch-inputting a command of self check (S3501). In this instance, it is checked whether the refrigerator is in normal operation (S3502).
It is checked whether the refrigerator is in abnormal operation or in error (S3503) during the self check process (s3503) and if the error or abnormal operation is checked, the message of that state is displayed (S3504).
The name and location of the portion or component part that is the reason of the abnormal operation may be displayed (S3505), which is the same as the control method shown in FIG. 33.
In that state, the abnormal operation or error of the refrigerator is transmitted to the nearest service center, regardless of the user input (SS3506).
Such a transmission and reception process may be implemented via wire and wireless internet communication.
The nearest service center receives and examines the abnormal operation or error of the refrigerator. After that, it determines whether the abnormal operation or error requests a recall service or an on-site service.
The result of that determination is re-transmitted to the terminal of the refrigerator by that service center and it is received by the terminal of the refrigerator. Contents of the reception are displayed on the terminal (S3507).
Based on the displayed contents, the user determines whether a service request is made to the service center (S3508). As shown in FIG. 36, the service request is an on-site service request or a recall request (S3601).
The user's on-site service request or recall request is made based on the result of the determination transmitted from the service center.
When the service requested in S3601 is the on-site service request, near service centers or the nearest service center are searched and the result of the searching is displayed on a map of the display module (S3602).
When two or more service centers are searched and marked, the user may select one of the service centers (S3603). When the nearest service center is searched and marked, such a selecting process may be omitted.
Repairmen belonging to a corresponding service center and available on-site times of the repairmen are displayed (S3604). When the user inputs a specific repairman and a corresponding available on-site time (S3605, S3606), a service completion message is displayed on the display module of the terminal (S3607).
Meanwhile, even when the user makes the recall request in S3601, the near service centers or the nearest service center based on the user's present location may be marked on the map of the display module (S3609).
When two or more service centers are searched and marked, the user may select one of two or more service centers (S3610). When the nearest service center is searched and marked, such a selecting process may be omitted.
A corresponding service center is called and a recall reservation is made to take the refrigerator for the recall service (S3611).
Once such a recall reservation step is completed, recall reservation completion and an expected time of the recall may be displayed on the display module of the terminal (S3612).
There will be described an embodiment for managing information on short expiration dates of the foods stored in the refrigerator and recipe information related to the foods as follows.
In reference to FIGS. 37 and 38, on an initial screen (or a standby screen) of the terminal 200 may be displayed widget information displaying a current date, schedules of family members and a current weather.
Also, on the initial screen may be displayed a plurality of menu icons used for operating various functions of the refrigerator 100.
When the user selects a corresponding menu icon from a user input part 230 or a touch screen type display module 241, a menu screen related to the icon is displayed on a touch screen.
As shown in FIG. 37, when the user selects a recipe menu icon 300 according to a first embodiment of the invention, the initial screen is changed into a food recipe providing screen (1500, see FIGS. 45 and 46).
Foods having short expiring dates are searched and marked on the recipe providing screen 1500. When the searched foods are selected, recipe information having the selected foods may be provided to the user.
According to an embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 38, different from the embodiment shown in FIG. 37, the recipe information screen 1600 is displayed on the initial screen, without changing of the initial screen.
In other words, the display module 241 of the terminal 200 is driven and an initial screen of the refrigerator 100 is displayed. After that, the foods 1610 having the short expiration dates and the cooking food recipe information 1620 including the foods 1610 may be displayed on the initial screen.
In FIGS. 39 and 43 may be described a process of setting detail food information such as the kinds, the expiration dates and the storage locations of the foods stored in the refrigerator 100.
When RFID tags storing detail food information such as the kinds, the prices, the purchase places and expiration dates of the foods are attached to the foods, a process which will be described in reference to FIGS. 39 to 43 can be omitted.
 FIG. 39 is a flow chart illustrating a process of setting the expiration dates of the foods and refrigerator compartment position of the foods on the terminal of the refrigerator according to the invention.
 FIGS. 40 to 43 are screen state diagrams illustrating a process of setting the expiration dates of the foods and refrigerator compartment position of the foods on the terminal of the refrigerator according to the invention.
In reference to FIGS. 39 to 43, the controller 280 of the terminal 200 transmits a control command for displaying a plurality of menu icons related to the functions of the refrigerator 100 on the touch screen.
When the user selects one of the menu icons to set detail information such as the kinds, the expiration dates and the storage positions of the foods which will be stored in the refrigerator from the user input part 230 or the touch screen (S3901), a setting window 1400 for setting detail information of the foods may be displayed on the setting window 1400 to set detail information of the foods (S3902).
In other words, the user sets the detail information including the kinds, the expiration dates and the storage positions of the foods which will be stored in the refrigerator 100 via the setting window 1400, before storing the foods in the refrigerator 100.
As shown in FIG. 40, the food detail information setting window 1400 includes a food kind setting window 1410, a food expiration date 1420 and a food refrigerator storing position setting window 1430.
Of course, to the food detail information setting window 1400 may be additionally set other information as well as the information on the kinds, the expiration dates and the storing positions of the food by the user operation.
For example, purchase places and prices of the foods may be additionally set.
Also, the food detail information setting window 1400 may include setting windows 1411, 1421 and 1431 for setting the kinds, the expiration dates and the storing positions of the foods as texts and setting windows 1412, 1422 and 1432 for setting the kinds, the expiration dates and the storing positions of the foods as icons.
In other words, when the user selects the text setting windows 1411, 1421 and 1431, the controller 280 displays a keypad for inputting texts on the screen of the display module 241.
When texts corresponding to the kinds, the expiration dates and the storing positions of the foods are input via the displayed keypad, input texts are stored in the memory 250.
Also, when the user selects the icon type food kind setting window 1412, the controller 280 displays icons displaying the kinds of the foods, respectively, that are provided in the memory 250 as shown in FIG. 41.
When the user selects one of the icons corresponding to the kind of the food which will be stored in the refrigerator, a selected icon may be recognized as the kind of the corresponding food.
When the user selects the icon type food expiration date setting window 1422, the controller 280 displays the calendar provided in the memory 250 as shown in FIG. 42.
When the expiration date of the food is set via the calendar, the date selected on the calendar may be recognized as the expiration date of the food.
When the user selects the icon type food storing position setting window 1432, the controller 280 displays an image of the refrigerator 100 in the memory 250.
A specific one of the compartments is selected in the image of the refrigerator and the selected compartment is recognized as the compartment where the food will be stored.
When the user sets detail information such as the kind, the expiration date and the storage position of the corresponding food via the food detail information setting window 1400, the controller 280 stores the set detail information in the memory 250.
When the recipe menu icon 300 is selected from the initial screen shown in FIG. 37, the food detail information set based on the processes of FIGS. 39 to 43 may be used for providing foods having short expiration dates and recipe information of the foods.
Such processes will be described in detail as follows.
The embodiment of the process shown in FIGS. 39 to 43 will be referenced to as a first embodiment related to the food storage and recipe providing.
 FIG. 44 is a flow chart illustrating the first embodiment of a process providing the recipe information of the foods having the short expiration dates according to the invention.
 FIGS. 45 and 46 are screen state diagrams illustrating the first embodiment of the process providing the recipe information of the foods having the short expiration dates according to the invention.
In reference to FIGS. 44 to 46, the controller 280 converts the initial screen shown in FIG. 37 into a food recipe providing screen 1500, when a recipe icon 300 is selected from the initial screen (S4401).
Foods having the shortest expiration dates with respect to the current date are searched out of the food detail information set to the process shown in FIGS. 39 to 43 or RFID tags attached to the foods (S4402).
The reference with respect to the short expiration date in S4402 may be set or changeable by the user.
For example, when the user sets 3 days as the reference with respect to the short expiration date, the controller 280 searches the foods having 3 or less expiration days with respect to the current date out of the food detail information set to the process shown in FIGS. 39 to 43 or the RFID tags attached to the foods.
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 45 and 46, the recipe providing screen 1500 of S4402 includes a first region 1510 displaying icons of the foods having the short expiration dates searched by the controller 280, a second region 1520 to which the food icons are dragged and dropped and a third region 1530 displaying recipe information having the foods dragged and dropped to the second region 1520.
The second region 1520 is displayed in a shape of a cooking container where actual foods are cooked such as a saucepan or frying pan.
Once searching the foods having the short expiration dates with respect to the current date through the detail food information set in the process of FIGS. 39 to 43 or the RFID tags attached to the foods (S4402), the controller 280 displays icons displaying the searched foods, respectively, on the first region 1510 (S4403).
As shown in FIGS. 45 and 46, the controller 280 may display information 1514 displaying the remaining days until the expiration dates of the foods in the icons.
In other words, the user may visually recognize how many days are remaining until the expiration date of the food corresponding to a current icon from the information 1514 displayed in the icon.
Also, the controller 280 may indirectly guide the user to preferentially consume the foods having the shorter expiration dates corresponding to the icons in S4403.
For that, the remaining days with respect to the icons are prioritized and the icons are aligned and displayed in the first region 1510 based on the order of the priority of the remaining days until to the expiration dates.
The controller 280 figures out the priority order of the remaining days until the expiration dates with respect to the icons in S4403 and it aligns and display the icons according to the priority order in the first region 1510.
When one of the icons displayed on the first region 1510 is selected, the controller 280 may display the detail information such as the kind of the food set to the icon, the remaining days to the expiration date of the food and the storage position of the food on the recipe providing screen 500.
Meanwhile, when at least one icon is selected on the first region 1510 (S4404), the controller 280 may search at least one recipe including the food corresponding to the selected icon through the recipe information provided in the memory 250 (S4405) and it may display the searched recipe information on the third region 1530 (S4406).
In other words, as shown in FIG. 45 (a), the controller 280 searches recipe information tips 1531 and 1532 including รขยยMeatรขยย foods dragged and dropped through the memory 250, when รขยยMeatรขยย icon 1511 of the first region 1510 is dragged and dropped to the second region 1520, and it displays the searched tips 1531 and 1532 on the third region 1530.
As shown in FIG. 45 (b), รขยยCucumberรขยย icon 1512 and รขยยShrimpรขยย icon 1513 may be additionally dragged and dropped in the second region 1520 in the state of รขยยMeatรขยย icon 1511 dragged and dropped in the second region 1520.
In this instance, the recipe information tips 1531, 1532 and 1533 including รขยยMeatรขยย and รขยยShrimpรขยย of the memory 250 are displayed on the third region 1530.
In other words, the controller 280 searches recipe information related to the foods corresponding to the selected icons in real-time, whenever the icons of the first region 1510 are selected in real-time. The real-time searched recipe information is updated in the third region 1530.
When the icons in the first region 1510 are dragged and dropped in the cooking-container-shaped second region 1520, the controller 280 generates a graphic effect providing simulation of filling and mixing the foods corresponding to the icons in the cooking container 1520 of the second region 1520 to provide reality of cooking to the user.
Also, when the icons are dragged and dropped in the second region 1520, the controller 280 detects storage positions of the foods corresponding to the dragged and dropped icons in the refrigerator.
As shown in FIG. 46, an information tip 1551 displaying the detected storage position may be displayed.
Also, the controller 280 may output the detected storage positions of the foods via the audio output module 242 as a sound.
Meanwhile, the controller 280 may indirectly guide the user to preferentially consume the foods having the short expiration dates when he or she searches the recipe information including the foods corresponding to the icons in S4405.
For that, recipe information tips having the foods having the shorter expiration dates as main materials may be preferentially searched and displayed.
Also, the controller 280 may preferentially search and display recipe information tips related to the preset recipe information preferred by the user, when searching the recipe information tips including the foods in S4405.
Unless the recipe information having the foods is provided in the memory 250 in S4405, the controller 280 is linked to an external recipe providing server or website via the wireless communication part 210.
The controller 280 searches recipe information tips having the foods on the recipe providing server or website and it downloads the searched recipe information tips in the memory 250. After that, the controller 280 may display the downloaded information on the third region 1530.
Meanwhile, the recipe information tips 1531, 1532 and 1533 may be displayed as icons combined with titles and images of the foods.
When one of the recipe information tips 1531, 1532 and 1533 displayed on the first region 1530 is selected (S4407), details of the recipe information and a cooking process according to the recipe are displayed (S4408).
At this time, the cooking process may be displayed as a text, an image, a moving picture and an animation.
When a specific recipe information tip is selected in S4407, the controller 280 searches additional cooking materials on the foods having the short expiration dates, rather than the foods included in the recipe information.
Hence, the additionally searched foods may be displayed.
The controller 280 may display icons displaying the additionally searched foods, differentiated from the other icons.
When the door 101 b of the refrigerator is open in the state of the specific recipe information being selected in S4407, the controller 280 controls lightings of the chambers where the actual foods are stored to be distinguished from lightings of the other chambers.
For example, the lightings of the compartments where the actual foods are stored may be relatively bright and the lightings of the other chambers are less bright to distinguish the former from the latter.
The first embodiment related to the food information and recipe providing according to the invention is described above in reference to FIGS. 44 to 46.
In reference to FIGS. 47 to 49, a second embodiment related to food information and recipe providing according to the invention will be described in detail as follows.
 FIG. 47 is a flow chart illustrating the second embodiment of a process providing the recipe information of the foods having the short expiration dates according to the invention.
 FIGS. 48 and 49 are screen state diagrams illustrating the second embodiment of the process providing the recipe information of the foods having the short expiration dates according to the invention.
In reference to FIGS. 47 to 49, the second embodiment will be described as follows.

Foods having the shortest expiration dates with respect to the current date are searched out of the food detail information set to the process shown in FIGS. 39 to 43 or RFID tags attached to the foods (S4703).
The reference with respect to the short expiration date in S4703 may be set or changeable by the user.
For example, when the user sets 3 days as the reference with respect to the short expiration date, the controller 280 searches the foods having 3 or less expiration days with respect to the current date out of the food detail information set to the process shown in FIGS. 39 to 43 or the RFID tags attached to the foods.
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 48 and 49, the recipe providing screen 1600 of S4402 displayed on the initial screen of S4703 may be divided into several regions.
More specifically, the recipe providing screen 1600 includes a first region 1610 displaying icons of the foods having the short expiration dates searched by the controller 280, a second region 1520 to which the food icons are dragged and dropped and a third region 1530 displaying recipe information having the foods dragged and dropped to the second region 1620.
Once searching the foods having the short expiration dates with respect to the current date through the detail food information set in the process of FIGS. 39 to 43 or the RFID tags attached to the foods (S4703), the controller 280 displays icons displaying the searched foods, respectively, on the first region 1510 (S4704).
As shown in FIGS. 48 and 49, the controller 280 may display information 1614 displaying the remaining days until the expiration dates of the foods in the icons.
In other words, the user may visually recognize how many days are remaining until the expiration date of the food corresponding to a current icon from the information 1614 displayed in the icon.
To guide the user to preferentially consume the foods having the shorter expiration dates corresponding to the icons out of the icons in S4704, the controller 280 may prioritize the remaining days with respect to the icons
Also, the controller 280 may align and display the icons in the first region 1610 based on the order of the priority of the remaining days until to the expiration dates.
The controller 280 figures out the priority order of the remaining days until the expiration dates with respect to the icons in S4704 and it aligns and display the icons according to the priority order in the first region 1610.
Meanwhile, once at least one icon is selected in the first region 1610, the controller 280 may search at least one recipe information tip having the food corresponding to the selected icon out of the recipe information tips provided in the memory 250 (S4706).
The controller 280 displays the searched recipe information tips in the second region 1610 (S4707).
In other words, as shown in FIG. 48 (a), the user selects รขยยCarrotรขยย icon 1611 and รขยยCucumberรขยย icon 1612 in the first region 1610 and then the controller 280 searches recipe information tips 1621 and 1622 having the selected รขยยCarrotรขยย and รขยยCucumberรขยย foods in the memory 250.
As shown in FIG. 48 (b), the controller 280 displays the searched recipe information tips 1621 and 1620 in the second region 1620.
At this time, when the Carrotรขยย icon 1611 and the รขยยCucumberรขยย icon 1612 are touched or dragged and dropped to the second region 1620, the controller 280 may search recipe information tips 1621 and 1622 having the รขยยCarrotรขยย and รขยยCucumberรขยย foods through the memory 250 and it may display the searched information tips in the second region 1620.
Although not shown in FIGS. 47 to 49, the controller may display recipe information tips in the second region 1620 without the selection process of the icons displayed in the first region 1610.
In other words, the controller 280 searches foods having the shorter expiration dates with respect to the current date and displays the icons corresponding to the searched foods in the first region 1610. The controller 280 directly displays the recipe information tips having the foods searched through the memory 250 in the second region 1620.
Meanwhile, once the icons 1611 and 1612 are selected, the controller 280 detects refrigerator storage positions of the foods corresponding to the selected icons. After that, as shown in FIG. 49, the controller 280 displays an information tip 1651 displaying the detected storage position.
Also, the controller 280 may output the detected storage positions of the foods via the audio output module 242 as a sound.
Meanwhile, the controller 280 may indirectly guide the user to preferentially consume the foods having the short expiration dates when he or she searches the recipe information including the foods corresponding to the icons in S4706.
For that, recipe information tips having the foods having the shorter expiration dates as main materials may be preferentially searched and displayed.
Also, the controller 280 may preferentially search and display recipe information tips related to the preset recipe information preferred by the user, when searching the recipe information tips including the foods in S4706.
Unless the recipe information having the foods is provided in the memory 250 in S4706, the controller 280 is linked to an external recipe providing server or website via the wireless communication part 210.
The controller 280 searches recipe information tips having the foods on the recipe providing server or website and it downloads the searched recipe information tips in the memory 250. After that, the controller 280 may display the downloaded information on the second region 1620.
Meanwhile, the recipe information tips 1621 and 1622 may be displayed as icons combined with titles and images of the foods.
When one of the recipe information tips 1621 and 1622 displayed on the second region 1620 is selected (S4708), details of the recipe information and a cooking process according to the recipe are displayed (S4709).
At this time, the cooking process may be displayed as a text, an image, a moving picture and an animation.
When a specific recipe information tip is selected in S4708, the controller 280 searches additional cooking materials on the foods having the short expiration dates, rather than the foods included in the recipe information.
Hence, the additionally searched foods may be displayed.
The controller 280 may display icons displaying the additionally searched foods, differentiated from the other icons.
When the door 101 b of the refrigerator is open in the state of the specific recipe information being selected in S4708, the controller 280 enables the user to figure out the positions of the chambers where actual foods related to the selected recipe are stored in the refrigerator 100 easily.
For that, the controller 280 controls lightings of the chambers where the actual foods are stored to be distinguished from lightings of the other chambers.
For example, the lightings of the compartments where the actual foods are stored may be relatively bright and the lightings of the other chambers are less bright to distinguish the former from the latter.
The first embodiment related to the food information and recipe providing according to the invention is described above in reference to FIGS. 47 to 49.
An embodiment related to information management having the food storage position information will be described as follows.
In reference to FIG. 50, on an initial screen (or a standby screen) of the terminal 200 may be displayed widget information displaying a current date, schedules of family members and a current weather.
Also, on the initial screen may be displayed a plurality of menu icons used for operating various functions of the refrigerator 100.
When the user selects a corresponding menu icon from a user input part 230 or a touch screen type display module 241, a menu screen related to the icon is displayed on a touch screen.
An icon displaying the kind of the corresponding food may be displayed on an inner space shaped image of the refrigerator having at least one compartment in the initial screen.
An imaginary food setting menu 311 may be further provided to imaginarily arrange the corresponding food in the compartment in the refrigerator inner space.
The imaginary setting menu 311 is connected with an expiration date setting menu (not shown) enabling the user to set an expiration date and details of the food corresponding to the icon displaying the kind of each food and an inner space shaped image (not shown) of the refrigerator having icons set via the expiration date setting menu connected thereto.
Accordingly, the corresponding food may form the imaginary food setting menu that can be virtually arranged in the inner compartment of the refrigerator.
In reference to FIGS. 51 to 55 there will be described in detail a process of setting the kind and the expiration date of the food to various icons by selecting the expiration date setting menu according to the invention before initially storing foods in the actual inner compartment of the refrigerator as follows.
 FIG. 51 is a flow chart illustrating a process of setting expiration dates to icons displaying the kinds of foods according to the invention.
 FIG. 52 is a screen state diagram illustrating the process of setting the expiration dates to the icons displaying the kinds of the foods according to the invention.
 FIGS. 53 to 55 are screen state diagrams illustrating a process of displaying expiration date information on the icons displaying the kinds of the foods.
In reference to FIGS. 51 to 55, the controller 280 provided in the terminal 200 for the refrigerator displays a list of icons displaying the kinds of foods, respectively, provided in the memory 250 on a screen of the display module 241 (S5101).
The icons may have shapes identical or similar to the shapes of the foods. Names of the foods may be displayed in or near the icons, respectively.
The icons may be acquired by download on a web via the wireless communication part 210 or defaulted in the memory 250. Or the icons may be acquired from an external device via the interface part 250.
Hence, at least one specific icon is selected out of the icons (S1502) and then the controller 280 displays a window for setting the expiration date of the food corresponding to the icon (S5103).
When the expiration date of the food corresponding to the icon is set via the setting window (S5104), the controller 280 maps the expiration date information set to the selected icon to store the mapped information in the memory 250 (S5105).
In other words, the user operates the terminal 200 for the refrigerator according to the invention before storing the purchased foods in food compartments in the refrigerator, to display the icons corresponding to the foods. After that, the user sets the expiration date to each of the icons corresponding to the purchased foods.
At this time, the expiration dates of the corresponding food may be set in the icons, respectively. Although not shown in FIG. 51, detail information such as the price and the purchase place of the food corresponding to the icons may be additionally set to the icons.
Also, the icons and the storage chambers of the refrigerator 100 may be relatively mapped to each other based on the corresponding food.
For example, FIG. 52 (a) illustrates that on the display module 241 screen are displayed a first icon 2020 displaying รขยยMeatรขยย category, a second icon 2030 displaying รขยยFishรขยย category, a third icon 2040 displaying รขยยCarrotรขยย category and a fourth icon 2050 displaying รขยยCheeseรขยย category.
Of course, the types of the icons and the categories of foods are not limited thereto.
Once the first icon 2020 is selected out of the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 via the user input part 230 or the display module 241, the controller displays an expiration date setting window 2060 for the foods in รขยยMeatรขยย category corresponding to the first icon 2020 on the screen.
The setting window 2060 may consist of an expiration date input window 2061 for the รขยยMeatรขยย category foods and a notifying the impending expiration date input window 2062.
When the expiration dates of รขยยMeatรขยย category foods are set via the setting window 2060, the controller 280 maps the expiration date information to the first icon 2020 and stores the mapped information in the memory 250 as shown in FIG. 52 (c).
At this time, the expiration date information set to the first icon 2020 may be displayed as shown in FIGS. 53 to 55 as follows.
In other words, when the expiration dates are set to the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 through the process of FIGS. 51 and 52, the controller 280 may display the impending expiration date of the corresponding food at outer circumferential surfaces of the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 as a gage as shown in FIG. 53.
For example, in FIGS. 51 and 52, the expiration date is set to the first icon 2020 as รขยย2010. 01. 30รขยย and the expiration date is set in the second icon 2030 as รขยย2010. 02. 05รขยย. Also, the expiration date is set to the third icon 2040 as รขยย2010. 02. 10รขยย and the expiration date is set to the fourth icon 2050 as รขยย2010. 02. 15รขยย. The impending expiration date notifying day is set as รขยย5 daysรขยย.
As shown in FIG. 53, when the current date is รขยย2010. 01. 20รขยย, the controller 280 controls fill-up states of the gages 2061 at the outer circumferential surfaces of the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 in the order of shorter expiration dates with respect to the date of รขยย2010. 01. 25รขยย that is the day after รขยย5 daysรขยย of the impending expiration date notifying day from the current date.
As shown in FIG. 54, the controller 280 may display information displaying expiration date states such as รขยยImpendingรขยย, รขยยGoodรขยย and รขยยFreshรขยย in the icons 20, 30, 40 and 50 in the order of the shorter expiration dates with respect to รขยย2010. 01. 25รขยย that is after รขยย5 daysรขยย of the impending expiration date notifying day from the current date.
Also, as shown in FIG. 55, the controller 280 may display information 2063 displaying the remaining days to each of the expiration dates in each of the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 with respect to รขยย2010. 01. 25รขยย that is after รขยย5 daysรขยย of the impending expiration date notifying day.
In reference to FIGS. 51 to 55 is described a process of setting the categories and the expiration dates of the foods corresponding to various icons according to the expiration date setting menu as mentioned above.
In reference to FIGS. 56 to 67 will be described in detail a process of virtually arranging corresponding foods in compartments in the refrigerator after the user arranging the imaginary food setting menu and arranging icons set according to the expiration date setting menu in an inner space image of the refrigerator as follows.
 FIG. 56 is a flow chart illustrating the imaginary food storage process in the terminal for the refrigerator according to the invention.
 FIGS. 57 to 67 are screen state diagrams illustrating the imaginary food storage process in the terminal for the refrigerator according to the invention.
First of all, in reference to FIGS. 56 and 57, the controller displays an initial screen having various information related to the refrigerator 100 on the display module 241 (S5601). When the imaginary food setting menu 11 according to the invention provided in the initial screen is selected (S5602) (see FIG. 57 (a)), the controller 280 displays a refrigerator inner image 300 displaying food storage chambers of the refrigerator 100 that is stored in the memory 250 and a list 400 of icons set by the process of FIGS. 51 to 55 (S5603) (see FIG. 57 (b)).
The refrigerator inner image 2300 may be the same as an actual shape of the inner space of the refrigerator 100 or only the same as shapes of inner storage chambers of the refrigerator 100.
In addition, the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 may be displayed to visually distinguish the categories, the remaining days to the expiration dates, the impending states of the expiration dates and details of the corresponding foods from each other in the process of FIGS. 51 to 55.
For example, the categories, the remaining days to the expiration dates, the impending states of the expiration dates and details of the corresponding foods may be displayed in the shapes of the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. When the user selects a specific icon is selected, detail information on a selected icon may be further displayed.
Meanwhile, when at least one icon is moved to a region corresponding to a specific storage chamber of the refrigerator inner image 2300 by the user's touch (S5604), the controller 280 may fix the position of the moved icon in the specific storage chamber (S5605).
In other words, the user may set an icon corresponding to the food which he or she will store in the process of FIGS. 51 to 55 mentioned above and the expiration date to the icon.
Hence, the user may arrange the icons in a region corresponding to the storage chamber of the refrigerator inner image 2300.
Accordingly, without opening the refrigerator 100 substantially, the user can recognize which foods are currently stored in the storage chambers of the refrigerator 100 by seeing the refrigerator inner image 2300 displayed on the screen of the terminal 200 for the refrigerator according to the invention.
Meanwhile, once a specific icon is dragged and dropped in a region corresponding to a specific storage chamber by the user, the controller 280 may position the icon in the specific storage chamber, which will be described in reference to FIG. 58.
In other words, when the first icon 2020 is dragged and dropped in a meat storage chamber 2350 in the refrigerator inner image 2300 by the user's touch as shown in FIG. 58 (a), the controller 280 may fix the position of the dragged and dropped first icon 2020 in the meat storage chamber 2350 as shown in FIG. 58 (b).
As shown in FIG. 59, when a specific icon and a region corresponding to a specific storage chamber are multi-touched by the user, the controller 280 may position the icon in the specific storage chamber.
When the first icon 2020 is dragged and dropped in the meat storage chamber 2350 in the refrigerator inner image 2300 by the user's touch as shown in FIG. 59 (a), the controller 280 may fix the position of the dragged and dropped first icon 2020 in the meat storage chamber 2350 as shown in FIG. 59 (b).
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 60 and 61, storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 2340, 2350 and 2360 in the refrigerator inner image 2300 and the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 are relatively mapped to each other based on the corresponding foods.
For example, the first icon 2020 displaying the รขยยMeatรขยย may be mapped to a meat storage chamber 2350.
The second icon 2030 displaying รขยยFishรขยย may be mapped to a fish storage chamber 2360.
The first icon 2040 displaying รขยยCarrotรขยย may be mapped with one of first and second vegetable storage chambers 2310 and 2320.
The fourth icon 2050 displaying รขยยCheeseรขยย may be mapped to a dairy good storage chamber 2330.
The storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 2340, 2350 and 2360 in the refrigerator inner image 2300 and the icons 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 are relatively mapped to each other based on the corresponding foods. When a specific icon is selected on the list 2400 in that state, the controller 280 may distinguishably display the storage chamber mapped with the icon from the storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 2340, 2350 and 2360.
In other words, when the first icon 2020 displaying รขยยMeatรขยย is touched as shown in FIG. 60 (a), the controller 280 may distinguishably display a region corresponding to the meat storage chamber 2350 mapped with the first icon 2020 from the other storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 2340 and 2360 as shown in FIG. 60 (b).
In other words, the controller 280 may inform the user of an adequate storage chamber for the food corresponding to the icon selected by the user.
 FIG. 60 (b) shows that the region corresponding to the meat storage chamber 2350 mapped with the first icon 2020 is blinking at preset intervals to distinguish the meat storage chamber 2350 from the other storage chambers 2310, 23020, 2330, 2340 and 2360.
The distinguishing method for the region corresponding to the meat storage chamber 2350 mapped with the first icon 2020 is not limited to the blinking method.
For example, variation of the display size, display color and highlighting of the meat storage chamber 2350 mapped with the first icon 2020 may be used for distinguishably display the meat storage chamber 2350 from the other storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 230 and 2360.
The user may identify that the meat storage chamber 2350 that is the adequate storage chamber of รขยยMeatรขยย corresponding to the selected first icon 2020 is distinguished from the other storage chambers 2310, 2320, 2330, 2340 and 2360.
As shown in FIG. 60 (c), the first icon 2020 may be arranged in the meat storage chamber 2350.
When the first icon 2020 corresponding to รขยยMeatรขยย is touched as shown in FIG. 61 (a), the controller 280 may display the information 2510 that induces the user to move the first icon 2020 to the meat storage chamber 2350 mapped with the first icon 2020 as shown in FIG. 61 (b).
In other words, the controller 280 may inform the user of moving the selected icon to the adequate storage chamber.
The induction information 2510 may display a guide line to be distinguished by the user for inducing him or her to move the first icon 2020 to the meat storage chamber 2350 or words for inducing the first icon 2020 to the meat storage chamber 2350 as shown in FIG. 61 (b).
The user may arrange the first icon 2020 in the meat storage chamber 2350, with setting the induction information 2510, as shown in FIG. 61 (c).
