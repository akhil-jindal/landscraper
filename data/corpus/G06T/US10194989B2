FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to systems and methods for manufacturing customized arthroplasty cutting jigs. More specifically, the present invention relates to automated systems and methods of manufacturing such jigs.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Over time and through repeated use, bones and joints can become damaged or worn. For example, repetitive strain on bones and joints (e.g., through athletic activity), traumatic events, and certain diseases (e.g., arthritis) can cause cartilage in joint areas, which normally provides a cushioning effect, to wear down. When the cartilage wears down, fluid can accumulate in the joint areas, resulting in pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility.
Arthroplasty procedures can be used to repair damaged joints. During a typical arthroplasty procedure, an arthritic or otherwise dysfunctional joint can be remodeled or realigned, or an implant can be implanted into the damaged region. Arthroplasty procedures may take place in any of a number of different regions of the body, such as a knee, a hip, a shoulder, or an elbow.
One type of arthroplasty procedure is a total knee arthroplasty (âTKAâ), in which a damaged knee joint is replaced with prosthetic implants. The knee joint may have been damaged by, for example, arthritis (e.g., severe osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis), trauma, or a rare destructive joint disease. During a TKA procedure, a damaged portion in the distal region of the femur may be removed and replaced with a metal shell, and a damaged portion in the proximal region of the tibia may be removed and replaced with a channeled piece of plastic having a metal stem. In some TKA procedures, a plastic button may also be added under the surface of the patella, depending on the condition of the patella.
Implants that are implanted into a damaged region may provide support and structure to the damaged region, and may help to restore the damaged region, thereby enhancing its functionality. Prior to implantation of an implant in a damaged region, the damaged region may be prepared to receive the implant. For example, in a knee arthroplasty procedure, one or more of the bones in the knee area, such as the femur and/or the tibia, may be treated (e.g., cut, drilled, reamed, and/or resurfaced) to provide one or more surfaces that can align with the implant and thereby accommodate the implant.
Accuracy in implant alignment is an important factor to the success of a TKA procedure. A one- to two-millimeter translational misalignment, or a one- to two-degree rotational misalignment, may result in imbalanced ligaments, and may thereby significantly affect the outcome of the TKA procedure. For example, implant misalignment may result in intolerable post-surgery pain, and also may prevent the patient from having full leg extension and stable leg flexion.
To achieve accurate implant alignment, prior to treating (e.g., cutting, drilling, reaming, and/or resurfacing) any regions of a bone, it is important to correctly determine the location at which the treatment will take place and how the treatment will be oriented. In some methods, an arthroplasty jig may be used to accurately position and orient a finishing instrument, such as a cutting, drilling, reaming, or resurfacing instrument on the regions of the bone. The arthroplasty jig may, for example, include one or more apertures and/or slots that are configured to accept such an instrument.
A system and method has been developed for producing customized arthroplasty jigs configured to allow a surgeon to accurately and quickly perform an arthroplasty procedure that restores the pre-deterioration alignment of the joint, thereby improving the success rate of such procedures. Specifically, the customized arthroplasty jigs are indexed such that they matingly receive the regions of the bone to be subjected to a treatment (e.g., cutting, drilling, reaming, and/or resurfacing). The customized arthroplasty jigs are also indexed to provide the proper location and orientation of the treatment relative to the regions of the bone. The indexing aspect of the customized arthroplasty jigs allows the treatment of the bone regions to be done quickly and with a high degree of accuracy that will allow the implants to restore the patient's joint to a generally pre-deteriorated state. However, the system and method for generating the customized jigs often relies on a human to âeyeballâ bone models on a computer screen to determine configurations needed for the generation of the customized jigs. This âeyeballingâ or manual manipulation of the bone modes on the computer screen is inefficient and unnecessarily raises the time, manpower and costs associated with producing the customized arthroplasty jigs. Furthermore, a less manual approach may improve the accuracy of the resulting jigs.
There is a need in the art for a system and method for reducing the labor associated with generating customized arthroplasty jigs. There is also a need in the art for a system and method for increasing the accuracy of customized arthroplasty jigs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed herein are customized arthroplasty jigs 2 and systems 4 for, and methods of, producing such jigs 2. The jigs 2 are customized to fit specific bone surfaces of specific patients. Depending on the embodiment and to a greater or lesser extent, the jigs 2 are automatically planned and generated and may be similar to those disclosed in these three U.S. patent applications: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/656,323 to Park et al., titled âArthroplasty Devices and Related Methodsâ and filed Jan. 19, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/146,862 to Park et al., titled âImproved Total Joint Arthroplasty Systemâ and filed May 15, 2002; and U.S. patent Ser. No. 11/642,385 to Park et al., titled âArthroplasty Devices and Related Methodsâ and filed Dec. 19, 2006. The disclosures of these three U.S. patent applications are incorporated by reference in their entireties into this detailed description.
A. Overview of System and Method for Manufacturing Customized Arthroplasty Cutting Jigs
For an overview discussion of the systems 4 for, and methods of, producing the customized arthroplasty jigs 2, reference is made to FIGS. 1A-1E. FIG. 1A is a schematic diagram of a system 4 for employing the automated jig production method disclosed herein. FIGS. 1B-1E are flow chart diagrams outlining the jig production method disclosed herein. The following overview discussion can be broken down into three sections.
The first section, which is discussed with respect to FIG. 1A and [blocks 100-125] of FIGS. 1B-1E, pertains to an example method of determining, in a three-dimensional (â3Dâ) computer model environment, saw cut and drill hole locations 30, 32 relative to 3D computer models that are termed restored bone models 28. The resulting âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 is referenced to the restored bone models 28 to provide saw cuts and drill holes that will allow arthroplasty implants to restore the patient's joint to its pre-degenerated or natural alignment state.
The second section, which is discussed with respect to FIG. 1A and [blocks 100-105 and 130-145] of FIGS. 1B-1E, pertains to an example method of importing into 3D computer generated jig models 38 3D computer generated surface models 40 of arthroplasty target areas 42 of 3D computer generated arthritic models 36 of the patient's joint bones. The resulting âjig dataâ 46 is used to produce a jig customized to matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas of the respective bones of the patient's joint.
The third section, which is discussed with respect to FIG. 1A and [blocks 150-165] of FIG. 1E, pertains to a method of combining or integrating the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 with the âjig dataâ 46 to result in âintegrated jig dataâ 48. The âintegrated jig dataâ 48 is provided to the CNC machine 10 or other rapid production machine (e.g., a stereolithography apparatus (âSLAâ) machine) for the production of customized arthroplasty jigs 2 from jig blanks 50 provided to the CNC machine 10. The resulting customized arthroplasty jigs 2 include saw cut slots and drill holes positioned in the jigs 2 such that when the jigs 2 matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas of the patient's bones, the cut slots and drill holes facilitate preparing the arthroplasty target areas in a manner that allows the arthroplasty joint implants to generally restore the patient's joint line to its pre-degenerated state or natural alignment state.
As shown in FIG. 1A, the system 4 includes a computer 6 having a CPU 7, a monitor or screen 9 and an operator interface controls 11. The computer 6 is linked to a medical imaging system 8, such as a CT or MRI machine 8, and a computer controlled machining system 10, such as a CNC milling machine 10.
As indicated in FIG. 1A, a patient 12 has a joint 14 (e.g., a knee, elbow, ankle, wrist, hip, shoulder, skull/vertebrae or vertebrae/vertebrae interface, etc.) to be replaced. The patient 12 has the joint 14 scanned in the imaging machine 8. The imaging machine 8 makes a plurality of scans of the joint 14, wherein each scan pertains to a thin slice of the joint 14.
As can be understood from FIG. 1B, the plurality of scans is used to generate a plurality of two-dimensional (â2Dâ) images 16 of the joint 14 [block 100]. Where, for example, the joint 14 is a knee 14, the 2D images will be of the femur 18 and tibia 20. The imaging may be performed via CT or MRI. In one embodiment employing MRI, the imaging process may be as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/946,002 to Park, which is entitled âGenerating MRI Images Usable For The Creation Of 3D Bone Models Employed To Make Customized Arthroplasty Jigs,â was filed Nov. 27, 2007 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description.
As can be understood from FIG. 1A, the 2D images are sent to the computer 6 for creating computer generated 3D models. As indicated in FIG. 1B, in one embodiment, point P is identified in the 2D images 16 [block 105]. In one embodiment, as indicated in [block 105] of FIG. 1A, point P may be at the approximate medial-lateral and anterior-posterior center of the patient's joint 14. In other embodiments, point P may be at any other location in the 2D images 16, including anywhere on, near or away from the bones 18, 20 or the joint 14 formed by the bones 18, 20.
As described later in this overview, point P may be used to locate the computer generated 3D models 22, 28, 36 created from the 2D images 16 and to integrate information generated via the 3D models. Depending on the embodiment, point P, which serves as a position and/or orientation reference, may be a single point, two points, three points, a point plus a plane, a vector, etc., so long as the reference P can be used to position and/or orient the 3D models 22, 28, 36 generated via the 2D images 16.
As shown in FIG. 1C, the 2D images 16 are employed to create computer generated 3D bone-only (i.e., âbone modelsâ) 22 of the bones 18, 20 forming the patient's joint 14 [block 110]. The bone models 22 are located such that point P is at coordinates (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) relative to an origin (X0, Y0, Z0) of an X-Y-Z axis [block 110]. The bone models 22 depict the bones 18, 20 in the present deteriorated condition with their respective degenerated joint surfaces 24, 26, which may be a result of osteoarthritis, injury, a combination thereof, etc.
In one embodiment, the bone surface contour lines of the bones 18, 20 depicted in the image slices 16 may be auto segmented via a image segmentation process as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 61/126,102, which was filed Apr. 30, 2008, is entitled System and Method for Image Segmentation in Generating Computer Models of a Joint to Undergo Arthroplasty, and is hereby incorporated by reference into the present application in its entirety.
Computer programs for creating the 3D computer generated bone models 22 from the 2D images 16 include: Analyze from AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Overland Park, Kans.; Insight Toolkit, an open-source software available from the National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (âITKâ), www.itk.org; 3D Slicer, an open-source software available from www.slicer.org; Mimics from Materialise, Ann Arbor, Mich.; and Paraview available at www.paraview.org.
As indicated in FIG. 1C, the 3D computer generated bone models 22 are utilized to create 3D computer generated ârestored bone modelsâ or âplanning bone modelsâ 28 wherein the degenerated surfaces 24, 26 are modified or restored to approximately their respective conditions prior to degeneration [block 115]. Thus, the bones 18, 20 of the restored bone models 28 are reflected in approximately their condition prior to degeneration. The restored bone models 28 are located such that point P is at coordinates (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0). Thus, the restored bone models 28 share the same orientation and positioning relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0) as the bone models 22.
In one embodiment, the restored bone models 28 are manually created from the bone models 22 by a person sitting in front of a computer 6 and visually observing the bone models 22 and their degenerated surfaces 24, 26 as 3D computer models on a computer screen 9. The person visually observes the degenerated surfaces 24, 26 to determine how and to what extent the degenerated surfaces 24, 26 surfaces on the 3D computer bone models 22 need to be modified to restore them to their pre-degenerated condition. By interacting with the computer controls 11, the person then manually manipulates the 3D degenerated surfaces 24, 26 via the 3D modeling computer program to restore the surfaces 24, 26 to a state the person believes to represent the pre-degenerated condition. The result of this manual restoration process is the computer generated 3D restored bone models 28, wherein the surfaces 24â², 26â² are indicated in a non-degenerated state.
In one embodiment, the above-described bone restoration process is generally or completely automated, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/111,924 to Park, which is entitled Generation of a Computerized Bone Model Representative of a Pre-Degenerated State and Usable in the Design and Manufacture of Arthroplasty Devices, was filed Apr. 29, 2008 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description. In other words, a computer program may analyze the bone models 22 and their degenerated surfaces 24, 26 to determine how and to what extent the degenerated surfaces 24, 26 surfaces on the 3D computer bone models 22 need to be modified to restore them to their pre-degenerated condition. The computer program then manipulates the 3D degenerated surfaces 24, 26 to restore the surfaces 24, 26 to a state intended to represent the pre-degenerated condition. The result of this automated restoration process is the computer generated 3D restored bone models 28, wherein the surfaces 24â², 26â² are indicated in a non-degenerated state.
As depicted in FIG. 1C, the restored bone models 28 are employed in a pre-operative planning (âPOPâ) procedure to determine saw cut locations 30 and drill hole locations 32 in the patient's bones that will allow the arthroplasty joint implants to generally restore the patient's joint line to its pre-degenerative alignment [block 120].
In one embodiment, the POP procedure is a manual process, wherein computer generated 3D implant models 34 (e.g., femur and tibia implants in the context of the joint being a knee) and restored bone models 28 are manually manipulated relative to each other by a person sitting in front of a computer 6 and visually observing the implant models 34 and restored bone models 28 on the computer screen 9 and manipulating the models 28, 34 via the computer controls 11. By superimposing the implant models 34 over the restored bone models 28, or vice versa, the joint surfaces of the implant models 34 can be aligned or caused to correspond with the joint surfaces of the restored bone models 28. By causing the joint surfaces of the models 28, 34 to so align, the implant models 34 are positioned relative to the restored bone models 28 such that the saw cut locations 30 and drill hole locations 32 can be determined relative to the restored bone models 28.
In one embodiment, the POP process is generally or completely automated. For example, a computer program may manipulate computer generated 3D implant models 34 (e.g., femur and tibia implants in the context of the joint being a knee) and restored bone models or planning bone models 28 relative to each other to determine the saw cut and drill hole locations 30, 32 relative to the restored bone models 28. The implant models 34 may be superimposed over the restored bone models 28, or vice versa. In one embodiment, the implant models 34 are located at point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0), and the restored bone models 28 are located at point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j). To cause the joint surfaces of the models 28, 34 to correspond, the computer program may move the restored bone models 28 from point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) to point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k), or vice versa. Once the joint surfaces of the models 28, 34 are in close proximity, the joint surfaces of the implant models 34 may be shape-matched to align or correspond with the joint surfaces of the restored bone models 28. By causing the joint surfaces of the models 28, 34 to so align, the implant models 34 are positioned relative to the restored bone models 28 such that the saw cut locations 30 and drill hole locations 32 can be determined relative to the restored bone models 28. A discussion of various embodiments of the automated POP process is provided later in this Detailed Description.
As indicated in FIG. 1E, in one embodiment, the data 44 regarding the saw cut and drill hole locations 30, 32 relative to point Pâ² (X0-j, Y0-k, Z0-k) is packaged or consolidated as the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 [block 145]. The âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 is then used as discussed below with respect to [block 150] in FIG. 1E.
As can be understood from FIG. 1D, the 2D images 16 employed to generate the bone models 22 discussed above with respect to [block 110] of FIG. 1C are also used to create computer generated 3D bone and cartilage models (i.e., âarthritic modelsâ) 36 of the bones 18, 20 forming the patient's joint 14 [block 130]. Like the above-discussed bone models 22, the arthritic models 36 are located such that point P is at coordinates (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0) of the X-Y-Z axis [block 130]. Thus, the bone and arthritic models 22, 36 share the same location and orientation relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0). This position/orientation relationship is generally maintained throughout the process discussed with respect to FIGS. 1B-1E. Accordingly, movements relative to the origin (X0, Y0, Z0) of the bone models 22 and the various descendants thereof (i.e., the restored bone models 28, bone cut locations 30 and drill hole locations 32) are also applied to the arthritic models 36 and the various descendants thereof (i.e., the jig models 38). Maintaining the position/orientation relationship between the bone models 22 and arthritic models 36 and their respective descendants allows the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 to be integrated into the âjig dataâ 46 to form the âintegrated jig dataâ 48 employed by the CNC machine 10 to manufacture the customized arthroplasty jigs 2.
Computer programs for creating the 3D computer generated arthritic models 36 from the 2D images 16 include: Analyze from AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Overland Park, Kans.; Insight Toolkit, an open-source software available from the National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (âITKâ), www.itk.org; 3D Slicer, an open-source software available from www.slicer.org; Mimics from Materialise, Ann Arbor, Mich.; and Paraview available at www.paraview.org.
Similar to the bone models 22, the arthritic models 36 depict the bones 18, 20 in the present deteriorated condition with their respective degenerated joint surfaces 24, 26, which may be a result of osteoarthritis, injury, a combination thereof, etc. However, unlike the bone models 22, the arthritic models 36 are not bone-only models, but include cartilage in addition to bone. Accordingly, the arthritic models 36 depict the arthroplasty target areas 42 generally as they will exist when the customized arthroplasty jigs 2 matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas 42 during the arthroplasty surgical procedure.
As indicated in FIG. 1D and already mentioned above, to coordinate the positions/orientations of the bone and arthritic models 22, 36 and their respective descendants, any movement of the restored bone models 28 from point P to point Pâ² is tracked to cause a generally identical displacement for the âarthritic modelsâ 36 [block 135].
As depicted in FIG. 1D, computer generated 3D surface models 40 of the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36 are imported into computer generated 3D arthroplasty jig models 38 [block 140]. Thus, the jig models 38 are configured or indexed to matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36. Jigs 2 manufactured to match such jig models 38 will then matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas of the actual joint bones during the arthroplasty surgical procedure.
In one embodiment, the procedure for indexing the jig models 38 to the arthroplasty target areas 42 is a manual process. The 3D computer generated models 36, 38 are manually manipulated relative to each other by a person sitting in front of a computer 6 and visually observing the jig models 38 and arthritic models 36 on the computer screen 9 and manipulating the models 36, 38 by interacting with the computer controls 11. In one embodiment, by superimposing the jig models 38 (e.g., femur and tibia arthroplasty jigs in the context of the joint being a knee) over the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36, or vice versa, the surface models 40 of the arthroplasty target areas 42 can be imported into the jig models 38, resulting in jig models 38 indexed to matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36. Point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) can also be imported into the jig models 38, resulting in jig models 38 positioned and oriented relative to point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) to allow their integration with the bone cut and drill hole data 44 of [block 125].
In one embodiment, the procedure for indexing the jig models 38 to the arthroplasty target areas 42 is generally or completely automated, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/959,344 to Park, which is entitled System and Method for Manufacturing Arthroplasty Jigs, was filed Dec. 18, 2007 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description. For example, a computer program may create 3D computer generated surface models 40 of the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36. The computer program may then import the surface models 40 and point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) into the jig models 38, resulting in the jig models 38 being indexed to matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36. The resulting jig models 38 are also positioned and oriented relative to point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) to allow their integration with the bone cut and drill hole data 44 of [block 125].
In one embodiment, the arthritic models 36 may be 3D volumetric models as generated from the closed-loop process discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/959,344 filed by Park. In other embodiments, the arthritic models 36 may be 3D surface models as generated from the open-loop process discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/959,344 filed by Park.
In one embodiment, the models 40 of the arthroplasty target areas 42 of the arthritic models 36 may be generated via an overestimation process as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/083,053, which is entitled System and Method for Manufacturing Arthroplasty Jigs Having Improved Mating Accuracy, was filed by Park Jul. 23, 2008, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description.
As indicated in FIG. 1E, in one embodiment, the data regarding the jig models 38 and surface models 40 relative to point Pâ² (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) is packaged or consolidated as the âjig dataâ 46 [block 145]. The âjig dataâ 46 is then used as discussed below with respect to [block 150] in FIG. 1E.
As can be understood from FIG. 1E, the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 is integrated with the âjig dataâ 46 to result in the âintegrated jig dataâ 48 [block 150]. As explained above, since the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44, âjig dataâ 46 and their various ancestors (e.g., models 22, 28, 36, 38) are matched to each other for position and orientation relative to point P and Pâ², the âsaw cut and drill hole dataâ 44 is properly positioned and oriented relative to the âjig dataâ 46 for proper integration into the âjig dataâ 46. The resulting âintegrated jig dataâ 48, when provided to the CNC machine 10, results in jigs 2: (1) configured to matingly receive the arthroplasty target areas of the patient's bones; and (2) having cut slots and drill holes that facilitate preparing the arthroplasty target areas in a manner that allows the arthroplasty joint implants to generally restore the patient's joint line to its pre-degenerated state or natural alignment state.
As can be understood from FIGS. 1A and 1E, the âintegrated jig dataâ 48 is transferred from the computer 6 to the CNC machine 10 [block 155]. Jig blanks 50 are provided to the CNC machine 10 [block 160], and the CNC machine 10 employs the âintegrated jig dataâ to machine the arthroplasty jigs 2 from the jig blanks 50.
For a discussion of example customized arthroplasty cutting jigs 2 capable of being manufactured via the above-discussed process, reference is made to FIGS. 1F-1I. While, as pointed out above, the above-discussed process may be employed to manufacture jigs 2 configured for arthroplasty procedures involving knees, elbows, ankles, wrists, hips, shoulders, vertebra interfaces, etc., the jig examples depicted in FIGS. 1F-1I are for total knee replacement (âTKRâ) or partial knee (âuni-kneeâ) replacement procedures. Thus, FIGS. 1F and 1G are, respectively, bottom and top perspective views of an example customized arthroplasty femur jig 2A, and FIGS. 1H and 1I are, respectively, bottom and top perspective views of an example customized arthroplasty tibia jig 2B.
As indicated in FIGS. 1F and 1G, a femur arthroplasty jig 2A may include an interior side or portion 100 and an exterior side or portion 102. When the femur cutting jig 2A is used in a TKR procedure, the interior side or portion 100 faces and matingly receives the arthroplasty target area 42 of the femur lower end, and the exterior side or portion 102 is on the opposite side of the femur cutting jig 2A from the interior portion 100.
The interior portion 100 of the femur jig 2A is configured to match the surface features of the damaged lower end (i.e., the arthroplasty target area 42) of the patient's femur 18. Thus, when the target area 42 is received in the interior portion 100 of the femur jig 2A during the TKR surgery, the surfaces of the target area 42 and the interior portion 100 match.
The surface of the interior portion 100 of the femur cutting jig 2A is machined or otherwise formed into a selected femur jig blank 50A and is based or defined off of a 3D surface model 40 of a target area 42 of the damaged lower end or target area 42 of the patient's femur 18.
As indicated in FIGS. 1H and 17, a tibia arthroplasty jig 2B may include an interior side or portion 104 and an exterior side or portion 106. When the tibia cutting jig 2B is used in a TKR procedure, the interior side or portion 104 faces and matingly receives the arthroplasty target area 42 of the tibia upper end, and the exterior side or portion 106 is on the opposite side of the tibia cutting jig 2B from the interior portion 104.
The interior portion 104 of the tibia jig 2B is configured to match the surface features of the damaged upper end (i.e., the arthroplasty target area 42) of the patient's tibia 20. Thus, when the target area 42 is received in the interior portion 104 of the tibia jig 2B during the TKR surgery, the surfaces of the target area 42 and the interior portion 104 match.
The surface of the interior portion 104 of the tibia cutting jig 2B is machined or otherwise formed into a selected tibia jig blank 50B and is based or defined off of a 3D surface model 40 of a target area 42 of the damaged upper end or target area 42 of the patient's tibia 20.
While the discussion provided herein is given in the context of TKR and TKR jigs and the generation thereof. However, the disclosure provided herein is readily applicable to uni-compartmental or partial arthroplasty procedures in the knee or other joint contexts. Thus, the disclosure provided herein should be considered as encompassing jigs and the generation thereof for both total and uni-compartmental arthroplasty procedures.
The remainder of this Detailed Discussion will now focus on various embodiments for performing POP.
B. Overview of Preoperative Planning (âPOPâ) Procedure
In one embodiment, as can be understood from [blocks 100-120] of FIGS. 1B-1C and from FIGS. 1J and 1K, which contain portions of a flow chart illustrating an overview of the POP system and method disclosed herein, medical images 16 of the femur and tibia 18, 20 are generated and formed into three dimensional (â3Dâ) bone models 22, which are then restored or modified into restored bone models 28â², 28â³ to represent the patient's femur and tibia 18, 20 prior to injury or degeneration [block 171]. Three dimensional computer models 34â², 34â³ of the femur and tibia implants are generated from engineering drawings of the implants and may be generated via any of the above-referenced 3D modeling programs [block 172]. The sizes of the implant models 34â², 34â³ are selected relative to the femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ [block 173]. The femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ are moved towards the implant models 34â², 34â³ to superimpose the femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ over the implant models 34â², 34â³ [block 174]. Landmark reference lines for the femur restored bone model 28â² are determined [block 175]. The elliptical contours of the femoral condyles 430, 445 are determined from the landmark reference lines [block 125]. The elliptical contours 505, 510 for the lateral and medial condyles 515, 520 of the femur implant model 34â² are determined [block 176]. The lateral and medial condyles 515, 520 of the femur implant model 34â² are aligned with the lateral and medial condyles 430, 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â² [block 177]. The superposing of the femur restored bone model 28â² with the implant model 34â² is refined by aligning the condyles of the of the femur restored bone model 28â² with the condyles of the implant model 34â² [block 178]. An asymmetrical or symmetrical femoral implant model 34â² is selected for the shape matching process [block 179]. An adjustment value tr is determined to account for cartilage thickness or joint gap of a restored joint [block 180]. The implant model 34â² is modified according to the adjustment value tr [block 181]. The shape matching process takes place where the articular condylar surfaces of the modified implant model 34â² are shape matched to the articular condylar surfaces of the restored bone model 28â². The process then continues as indicated in [block 125] of FIG. 1E.
As indicated in FIG. 1J with respect to the tibia, areas of interest are identified for the tibia restored model [block 183]. Reference points are identified for the tibia restored bone model and the tibia implant model [block 184]. An adjustment value tr is determined for the tibia implant model [block 185]. Slope vectors are identified for the tibia restored bone model [block 186] and the tibia implant model [block 187]. Potential IR/ER misalignment is addressed [block 188]. The tibia implant model is modified according to the adjustment value tr [block 189]. The condylar articular surfaces of tibia implant model are shape matched to those of the tibia restored bone model [block 190].
This ends the overview of the POP process. The following discussions will address each of the aspects of the POP process in detail.
C. Computer Modeling Femur and Tibia
 FIG. 2A depicts 3D computer generated restored bone models 28â², 28â³ of the femur and tibia 18, 20 generated from medical imaging scans 16 and representing the patient's femur 18 and tibia 20 prior to injury or degeneration [see block 171 of FIG. 1J]. More specifically, FIG. 2A is an isometric view of a 3D computer model 28â² of a femur lower end 200 and a 3D computer model 28â³ of a tibia upper end 205 representative of the corresponding patient bones 18, 20 in a non-deteriorated state and in position relative to each to form a knee joint 14. The femur lower end 200 includes condyles 215, and the tibia upper end 205 includes a plateau 220. The models 28â², 28â³ are positioned relative to each other such that the curved articular surfaces of the condyles 215, which would normally mate with complementary articular surfaces of the plateau 220, are instead not mating, but roughly positioned relative to each other to generally for the knee joint 14.
As generally discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1A-1C, the POP begins by using a medical imaging process, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and/or another other medical imaging process, to generate imaging data of the patient's knee. The generated imaging data is sent to a preoperative planning computer program. Upon receipt of the data, the computer program converts the data (e.g., two-dimensional MRI images 16) into 3D anatomical computer bone models 22 of the knee joint 14 with the aid of a medical imaging conversion computer program, the bone models 22 being representative of the patient's bones 18, 20 in the current deteriorated state. For example, current commercially available MRI machines use 8 bit (255 grayscale) to show the human anatomy. Therefore, certain components of the knee, such as the cartilage, cortical bone, cancellous bone, meniscus, etc., can be uniquely viewed and recognized with 255 grayscale.
As provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/111,924 to Park, which is entitled Generation of a Computerized Bone Model Representative of a Pre-Degenerated State and Usable in the Design and Manufacture of Arthroplasty Devices, was filed Apr. 29, 2008 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description, specialized medical converging software recognizes the anatomy of the knee and shapes the bone models 22 using mathematical algorithms, such as sequences of nth order polynomials, where n is greater than or equal to 3. A technique such as surface-rendering is then used to construct 3D restored bone models 28â², 28â³ of the knee joint 14 from the bone models 22. Examples of medical imaging computer programs that may be used here include Analyze (from AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Overland Park, Kans.), open-source software such as the Insight Toolkit (ITK, www.itk.org) and 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org), and Mimics (from Materialise, Ann Arbor, Mich.).
In one embodiment, the resulting 3D restored bone models 28â², 28â³ of the femur portion 200 and tibia portion 205 forming the knee joint 14 include the cortical bone of the femur 18 and the tibia 20. Depending on the embodiment, the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ may includes articular cartilage attached to the distal region of the femur 18 and the proximal region of the tibia 20. The computer program may automatically exclude the rest of the soft tissue, as well as the cancellous bone, from the 3D computer models 28â², 28â³, although in some variations the computer program may not automatically exclude the rest of the soft tissue and/or the cancellous bone.
The 3D computer generated femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ are repaired versions of the patient's femur 18 and tibia 20 as these bones are believed to have existed before degenerating into their current existing date, the current state of the patient's femur 18 and tibia 20 being represented by the 3D bone models 22. In other words, the femur and tibia computer generated bone models 22 resulting from the MRI scans depict the femur 18 and tibia 20 in the current deteriorated state. These models 22 are then modified or restored into restored bone models 28â², 28â³ to represent the femur 18 and tibia 20 as they likely appeared before beginning to degenerate. The resulting modified or restored models 28â², 28â³ can then be used for planning purposes, as described later in this Detailed Description.
For greater detail regarding the methods and systems for computer modeling joint bones, such as the femur and tibia bones forming the knee, please see the following U.S. patent applications, which are all incorporated herein in their entireties: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/656,323 to Park et al., titled âArthroplasty Devices and Related Methodsâ and filed Jan. 19, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/146,862 to Park et al., titled âImproved Total Joint Arthroplasty Systemâ and filed May 15, 2002; U.S. patent Ser. No. 11/642,385 to Park et al., titled âArthroplasty Devices and Related Methodsâ and filed Dec. 19, 2006; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/111,924 to Park, titled âGeneration of a Computerized Bone Model Representative of a Pre-Degenerated State and Usable in the Design and Manufacture of Arthroplasty Devicesâ and filed Apr. 29, 2008.
 FIG. 2B is an isometric view of a computer model of a femur implant 34â² and a computer model of a tibia implant 34â³ in position relative to each to form an artificial knee joint 14. The computer models 34â², 34â³ may be formed, for example, via computer aided drafting or 3D modeling programs [see block 172 of FIG. 1J].
The femur implant model 34â² will have a joint side 240 and a bone engaging side 245. The joint side 240 will have a condoyle-like surface for engaging a complementary surface of the tibia implant model 34â³. The bone engaging side 245 will have surfaces and engagement features 250 for engaging the prepared (i.e., sawed to shape) lower end of the femur 18.
The tibia implant model 34â³ will have a joint side 255 and a bone engaging side 260. The joint side 255 will have a plateau-like surface configured to engage the condoyle-like surface of the femur implant model 34â². The bone engaging side 260 will have an engagement feature 265 for engaging the prepared (i.e., sawed to shape) upper end of the tibia 20.
As discussed in the next subsection of this Detailed Description, the femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ may be used in conjunction with the implant models 34â², 34â³ to select the appropriate sizing for the implants actually to be used for the patient.
D. Selecting the Sizes for the Femoral and Tibial Implants
 FIG. 3A is a plan view of the joint side 240 of the femur implant model 34â² depicted in FIG. 2B. FIG. 3B is an axial end view of the femur lower end 200 of the femur restored bone model 28â² depicted in FIG. 2A and showing the condoyle surfaces 215. The views depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B are used to select the proper size for the femoral implant model 34â² [see block 173 of FIG. 1J].
As can be understood from FIG. 3A, each femoral implant available via the various implant manufactures may be represented by a specific femoral implant 3D computer model 34â² having a size and dimensions specific to the actual femoral implant. Thus, the representative implant model 34â² of FIG. 3A may have an associated size and associated dimensions in the form of, for example, an anterior-posterior extent iAP and medial-lateral extent iML. These implant extents iAP, iML may be compared to the dimensions of the femur restored bone model 28â² that represents the patient's femur 18 as it may have existed prior to degeneration or injury. For example, the femur restored bone model 28â² may have dimensions such as, for example, an anterior-posterior extent bAP and a medial-lateral extent bML, as shown in FIG. 3B. In FIG. 3A, the anterior-posterior extent iAP of the femoral implant model 34â² is measured from the anterior edge 270 to the posterior edge 275 of the femoral implant model 34â², and the medial-lateral extent iML is measured from the medial edge 280 to the lateral edge 285 of the femoral implant model 34â².
Each patient has femurs that are unique in size and configuration from the femurs of other patients. Accordingly, each femur restored bone model 28â² will be unique in size and configuration to match the size and configuration of the femur medically imaged. As can be understood from FIG. 3B, the femoral anterior-posterior length bAP is measured from the anterior edge 290 of the patellofemoral groove to the posterior edge 295 of the femoral condyle, and the femoral medial-lateral length bML is measured from the medial edge 300 of the medial condyle to the lateral edge 305 of the lateral condyle.
As can be understood from FIG. 3C, which is a flow chart depicting the process undertaken by the system 4 when selecting the femur implant model 34â² corresponding to the appropriate femur implant size to be used in the actual arthroplasty procedure, the system 4 determines the femoral anterior-posterior length bAP and the femoral medial-lateral length bML for, the femur restored bone model 28â² [block 1000].
In one embodiment, there is a limited number of sizes of a candidate femoral implant. For example, one manufacturer may supply six sizes of femoral implants and another manufacturer may supply eight or another number of femoral implants. The iAP and iML dimensions of these candidate implants may be stored in a database. The bAP and bML are compared to the iAP and iML of candidate femoral implants stored in the database [block 1005]. The system 4 selects a femoral implant model 34â² corresponding to a candidate femoral implant having iAP and iML that satisfies the following two relationships: bMLâ¥iML+Îµ, wherein â2 mm<Îµ<5 mm; and bAPâ¥iAP+Ï, where â4 mm<Ï<4 mm [block 1010]. As an alternative to [block 1010], in one embodiment, instead of selecting from a limited number of candidate femoral implants, these two relationships are used to manufacture a custom sized femoral implant.
Still referring to FIG. 3C and continuing from [block 1010], the system 4 provides the computer modeled femoral implant 34â² corresponding to the selected candidate femoral implant [block 1015]. This computer modeled femoral implant 34â², which corresponds to the selected candidate femoral implant, is used with the computer modeled femur restored bone model 28â² in computer modeling a femoral arthroplasty jig, as discussed later in this Detailed Description.
 FIG. 3D is a plan view of the joint side 255 of the tibia implant model 34â³ depicted in FIG. 2B. FIG. 3E is an axial end view of the tibia upper end 205 of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ of FIG. 2A and showing the plateau 220. The views depicted in FIGS. 3D and 3E are used to select the proper size for the tibial implant model 34â³.
As can be understood from FIG. 3D, each tibial implant available via the various implant manufactures may be represented by a specific tibia implant 3D computer model 34â³ having a size and dimensions specific to the actual tibia implant. Thus, the representative implant model 34â³ of FIG. 3D may have an associated size and associated dimensions in the form of, for example, anterior-posterior extent cAP and the medial-lateral extent cML of the tibia model 34â³, as shown in FIG. 3E. In FIG. 3D, the anterior-posterior extent jAP of the tibia implant model 34â³ is measured from the anterior edge 310 to the posterior edge 315 of the tibial implant model 34â³, and the medial-lateral extent jML is measured from the medial edge 320 to the lateral edge 325 of the tibial implant model 34â³.
Each patient has tibias that are unique in size and configuration from the tibias of other patients. Accordingly, each tibia restored bone model 28â³ will be unique in size and configuration to match the size and configuration of the tibia medically imaged. As can be understood from FIG. 3E, the tibial anterior-posterior length cAP is measured from the anterior edge 330 of the of the tibial restored bone model 28â³ to the posterior edge 335 of the tibial restored bone model 28â³, and the tibial medial-lateral length cML is measured from the medial edge 340 of the medial plateau of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ to the lateral edge 345 of the lateral plateau of the tibia restored bone model 28â³.
As can be understood from FIG. 3F, which is a flow chart depicting the process undertaken by the system 4 when selecting the tibia implant model 34â³ corresponding to the appropriate tibia implant size to be used in the actual arthroplasty procedure, the system 4 determines the tibial anterior-posterior length cAP and the tibial medial-lateral length cML [block 1020].
In one embodiment, there is a limited number of sizes of a candidate tibia implant. For example, one manufacturer may supply six sizes of tibia implants and another manufacturer may supply eight or another number of tibia implants. The jAP and jML dimensions of these candidate implants may be stored in a database. The cAP and cML are compared to the jAP and jML of candidate tibia implants stored in the database [block 1025]. The system 4 selects a tibia implant model 34â³ corresponding to a candidate tibia implant having jAP and jML that satisfies the following two relationships: cMLâ¥jML+Ï, wherein â2 mm<Ï<4 mm; and cAPâ¥jAP+0, where â2 mm<Î¸<4 mm [block 1030]. As an alternative to [block 1030], in one embodiment, instead of selecting from a limited number of candidate tibia implants, these two relationships are used to manufacture a custom sized tibia implant.
Still referring to FIG. 3F and continuing from [block 1030], the system 4 provides the computer modeled tibia implant 34â³ corresponding to the selected candidate tibia implant [block 1035]. This computer modeled tibia implant 34â³, which corresponds to the selected candidate tibia implant, is used with the computer modeled tibia restored bone model 28â³ in computer modeling a tibia arthroplasty jig, as discussed later in this Detailed Description.
Femoral and tibial implants represented by the implant models 34â², 34â³, such as those depicted in FIG. 2B, are commercially available. Examples of commercially available implants include the Vanguardâ¢ prosthetic femoral arthroplasty implants (manufactured by Biomet, Inc.), the TriathlonÂ® Knee System (from StrykerÂ® Orthopedics), and the P.F.C.Â® Sigma Knee System (from Depuy).
E. Moving Femur and Tibia Models Towards Corresponding Implant Models Such That Femur and Tibia Models are Superimposed Over the Implant Models.
As explained above with respect to [blocks 100-115] of FIGS. 1A-1C, the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ can be reconstructed from bone models 22 generated from the plurality of MRI image slices 16, which are scanned around a live patient's knee 14. As can be understood from [blocks 100-115] of FIGS. 1A-1C, the image slices 16, bone models 22 and restored bone models 28 may be positioned at a coordinate point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) relative to an origin X0, Y0, Z0 of an X-Y-Z axis throughout their respective generations and existences. Similarly, the implant models 34 may be positioned at a coordinate point P (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) relative to the origin X0, Y0, Z0 of the X-Y-Z axis throughout their existence. Thus, as indicated in FIG. 4A, which is an isometric view of the restored bone models 28 and implant models 34, the restored bone models 28 may be positioned such that a point PRBM associated with the restored bone models 28 occupies coordinate point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) relative the origin X0, Y0, Z0 of the X-Y-Z axis, and the implant models 34 may be positioned such that a point PIM associated with the implant models 34 occupies coordinate point P (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) relative the origin X0, Y0, Z0 of the X-Y-Z axis.
As indicated by arrows A in FIG. 4A, the restored bone models 28 and implant models 34 may be moved together to superimpose one type of model over the other type of model. For example, in one embodiment, the implant models 34 are held stationary at coordinate point P (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) and, as indicated by arrows A, the restored bone models 28 are moved from coordinate point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) to coordinate point (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) such that point PRBM of the restored bone models 28 moves from coordinate point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) to coordinate point (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k). As a result and as indicated in FIG. 4B, which is an isometric view of the restored bone models 28 superimposed over the implant models 34, points PRBM and PIM end up both being generally occupying coordinate point (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) such that the models 28, 34 are superimposed.
As mentioned above with respect to the discussion of [block 135] of FIG. 1D, movement of the restored bone models 28 during the POP or other process from coordinate point P (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) to another coordinate point, such as, coordinate point (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k), is reflected or mimicked by the arthritic models 36 such that the location and orientation of the arthritic models 36 matches those of the restored bone models 28, thereby facilitating the combining of the data types 44, 46 into the integrated jig data 48, as discussed in [block 150] of FIG. 1E.
In one embodiment, the point PIM associated with the implant models 34 is located between the implant models 34â², 34â³ close to their centers, near the intercondylar notch of the femur implant model 34â², and the point PRBM associated with the restored bone models 28 is located between the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ close to their centers, near the intercondylar notch of the femur restored bone model 28â². Of course, depending on the embodiment, the points PIM, PRBM may be located at other locations relative to their respective models 34, 28 as long as the locations of the points PIM, PRBM relative to their respective models 34, 28 are generally coordinated with each other. For example, points PIM, PRBM could be positioned relative to their respective models 34, 28 such that the points PIM, PRBM are generally centered at the most distal point of the medial articular condylar surface of each respective model 34, 28.
The preceding example is given in the context of holding the implant models 34 in place and moving the restored bone models 28 to the implant models 34 to superimpose the restored bone models 28 over the implant models 34. However, in other embodiments, the reverse situation may be the case, wherein the restored bone models 28 are held in place and the implant models 34 are moved to the restored bone models 28 to superimpose the implant models 34 over the restored bone models 28.
In summary, as can be understood from FIGS. 4A-4B and FIG. 4C, which is a flow chart summarizing the process of superimposing the models 28, 34 over each other as mention in [block 174] of FIG. 1J, the implant reference point PIM is designated as coordinate point (X0-k, Y0-k, Z0-k) with respect to an X-Y-Z coordinate system having an origin at coordinate point (X0, Y0, Z0) [block 1035]. The implant reference point PIM may be located between the implants models 34â², 34â³, close to their centers, near the intercondylar notch of the femur implant model 34â². The restored bone model reference point PRBM is designated as coordinate point (X0-j, Y0-j, Z0-j) with respect to the X-Y-Z coordinate system having its origin at coordinate point (X0, Y0, Z0) [block 1040]. The restored bone model reference point PRBM may be located between the restored bone models 28â², 28â³, close to their centers, near the intercondylar notch of the femur restored bone model 28â².
In one embodiment, in the image analysis of the POP, the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ may be translated to near the corresponding implants models 34â², 34â³ through a distance (Î±, Î², Î³) by f (x-Î±, y-Î², z-Î³), where Î±=X0-kâX0-j; Î²=Y0-kâY0-j; and Î³=Z0-kâZ0-j [block 1045]. In other words, the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ are moved to the implant models 34â², 34â³ such that the two reference points PRBM, PIM are generally in the same location. Therefore, the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ and the implants models 34â², 34â³ are closely superimposed to provide the starting reference points for translational and, rotational positioning of the femoral and tibial implants models 34â², 34â³ with respect to the femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ for the shape matching process discussed in the following subsections of this Detailed Discussion. In other words, the above-described superimposing of the models 28, 34 may act as an initial rough positioning of the models in preparation for the following shape matching process.
F. Refining Positioning Between Bone and Implant Models
Once the bone and implant models 28, 34 are roughly positioned relative to each other via the above-described superimposing process, the positioning of the bone and implant models 28, 34 relative to each other is further refined prior to the shape matching process. The position refining process first entails the identification of landmark reference planes for the femur model, the utilization of the landmark reference planes to indentify the elliptical contours of the femur restored bone model, and then the correlation of the femur elliptical contours to corresponding elliptical contours of the implant model in an approximate manner.
1. Determining Landmark Reference Planes for Femur Model.
The determination of the landmark reference planes for the femur model may be made via at least two methods. For example, a first method entails employing asymptotic lines to identify the landmark reference planes. In a second method, the landmark reference planes are identified via their relationship to a trochlear groove plane.
i. Landmark Reference Planes Identified Via Asymptotic Lines
 FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate a process in the POP wherein the system 4 determines landmark reference planes via asymptotic lines for the femur restored bone model 28â² (see FIG. 1J [block 175]) relative to a coordinate system axis 410. FIG. 5C is a flow chart illustrating the process for determining the landmark references. FIG. 5A is a view of the lateral side of the lower or distal portion of the femur restored bone model 28â² illustrating how to determine landmark reference planes for the posterior and anterior sides 415, 420 of the femur planning model, which is also known as the femur restored bone model 28â². As indicated in FIGS. 5A and 5C, an asymptotic line-cd can be obtained by the exponential function, y=Î±+Î² EXP (âÎ¼(xâw)), from the anterior-distal femur along the anterior side 420 of the femoral shaft 423 [block 1050]. To obtain the tangent contact spot 425 representing the posterior extremity of lateral femoral condyle 430, the line-ab along the curvature of femoral condyle can be identified by using the asymptotic line-cd, where lines-cd, ab are parallel to each other, or where line-ab is substantially parallel to line-cd such that the acute angle between lines-cd, ab is less than approximately five degrees [block 1055]. In some embodiments, line-ab may represent a plane-ab that includes line-ab and is generally perpendicular to the sagittal image slice planes 16 used to form the restored bone model, as discussed with respect to FIGS. 1B-1C.
 FIG. 5B is an anterior or coronal view of FIG. 5A illustrating how to determine landmark reference planes for the medial and lateral sides 435, 440 of the femur planning model 28â². As indicated in FIGS. 5B and 5C, the asymptotic line-ah can be obtained by the asymptotic distribution, y=Î±+Î² EXP(âÎ¼(xâÏ)), along the curvature of the lateral epicondyle 430 up to the lateral edge of femoral shaft 423 [block 1060]. Similarly, the asymptotic line-bj can be obtained by the asymptotic distribution, y=Î±+Î² EXP(âÎ¼(xâÏ)), along the curvature of the medial epicondyle 445 up to the medial edge of femoral shaft 423 [block 1065].
As indicated in FIG. 5B, the point-k represents the center of the distal femur shaft 423, the lowermost point in the patellofemoral surface 450. The point-i is located approximately at the midpoint between point-h and point-j. The lines-ik, ah are parallel, and line-ik defines the femoral anatomical axis (FAA) 455 [block 1070]. The lowest extremity of the medial epicondyle 445 is a tangent contact spot 460 that can be obtained in FIG. 5B by a line-ef extending across tangent contact spot 460, as line-ef is perpendicular to line-ik [block 1075]. In FIG. 5B, line-hi is related to line-ij by the equation: hi=ij+m, where â3 mm<m<3 mm [block 1080]. In some embodiments, line-ef may represent a plane-ef that includes line-ef and is generally perpendicular to the sagittal image slice planes 16 used to form the restored bone model, as discussed with respect to FIGS. 1B-1C.
ii. Landmark Reference Lines Identified Via Trochlear Groove Plane.
 FIGS. 5D-5G illustrate a process in the POP wherein the system 4 determines landmark reference planes via their relationship to the trochlear groove plane-GHO of the femur restored bone model 28â² (see FIG. 1J [block 175]). FIG. 5D is a sagittal view of a femur restored bone model 28â² illustrating the orders and orientations of imaging slices 16 (e.g., MRI slices, CT slices, etc.) forming the femur restored bone model 28â². FIG. 5E is the distal images slices 1-5 taken along section lines 1-5 of the femur restored bone model 28â² in FIG. 5D. FIG. 5F is the coronal images slices 6-8 taken along section lines 6-8 of the femur restored bone model 28â² in FIG. 5D. FIG. 5G is a perspective view of the distal end of the femur restored bone model 28â².
In one embodiment, the identification of the trochlear groove plane-GHO may be made during the verification of the accuracy of the bone restoration process as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/111,924 to Park, which is entitled Generation of a Computerized Bone Model Representative of a Pre-Degenerated State and Usable in the Design and Manufacture of Arthroplasty Devices, was filed Apr. 29, 2008 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Detailed Description.
As shown in FIG. 5D, a multitude of image slices are compiled into the femur restored bone model 28â² from the image slices originally forming the femur bone model 22â² (see FIG. 1C [block 110]) and those restored image slices are modified via the methods disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/111,924. Image slices may extend medial-lateral in planes that would be normal to the longitudinal axis of the femur, such as image slices 1-5. Image slices may extend medial-lateral in planes that would be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femur, such as image slices 6-8. The number of image slices may vary from 1-50 and may be spaced apart in a 2 mm spacing.
As shown in FIG. 5E, each of the slices 1-5 can be aligned vertically along the trochlear groove, wherein points-G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 respectively represent the lowest extremity of trochlear groove for each slice 1-5. By connecting the various points G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, a point-O can be obtained. As can be understood from FIG. 5G, resulting line-GO, is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to tangent line-AC. In a 90Â° knee extension, line-GO is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the joint line of the knee and line-AC. As can be understood from FIGS. 6A and 6B, points-A and C represent the most posterior contact points on the femoral condylar surfaces.
As shown in FIG. 5F, each of the slices 6-8 can be aligned vertically along the trochlear groove, wherein points-H6, H7, H8 respectively represent the lowest extremity of the trochlear groove for each slice 6-8. By connecting the various points-H6, H7, H8, the point-O can again be obtained. As can be understood from 5G, resulting line HO is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to tangent line-BD. In a 0Â° knee extension, line HO is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the joint line of the knee and line BD. As can be understood from FIGS. 6A and 6B, points-B and D represent the most distal contact points on the femoral condylar surfaces.
As illustrated in FIG. 5G, the trochlear grove plane-GHO, as the reference across the most distal extremity of the trochlear groove of the femur and in a 90Â° knee extension, should be perpendicular to tangent line AC. The line-HO, as the reference across the most posterior extremity of trochlear groove of the femur and in a 0Â° knee extension, should be perpendicular to tangent line AC.
Line HO and line AC may form a plane S, and lines GO and line BD may form a plane P that is perpendicular to plane S and forms line SR therewith. Line HO and line GO are parallel or nearly parallel to each other. Lines AC, BD and SR are parallel or nearly parallel to each other. Lines AC, BD and SR are perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to lines HO and GO and the trochlear plane GHO.
2. Determine Elliptical Contours for Condyles of Femur Restored Bone Model.
 FIGS. 6A and 6B are respective sagittal views of the lateral and medial condyles 430, 445 of the distal femur restored bone model 28â² depicted in FIGS. 5B and 5G, wherein elliptical contours of the condyles 430, 445 have been determined from the landmark reference lines depicted in FIG. 5B or FIG. 5G (see FIG. 1J [block 176]). FIG. 6C is a flow chart illustrating the process of determining the elliptical contours of the condyles 430, 445 from the landmark reference lines depicted in FIG. 5B or FIG. 5G.
Based on plane-ef from FIG. 5B and plane-ab from FIG. 5A, or, alternatively, from plane-p from FIG. 5G and plane-s from FIG. 5G, the related reference landmarks can be obtained on the sagittal views of lateral condyle 430 and medial condyle 445 in FIGS. 6A and 6B. As can be understood from a comparison of FIGS. 5A and 5G to FIGS. 6A and 6B, reference lines or planes-AE, CF are parallel to plane-ab and plane-s and respectively intersect the posterior extremity of the lateral femoral condyle 430 and the medial femoral condyle 445 at respective tangent spots A, C [block 1085]. As can be understood from a comparison of FIGS. 5B and 5G to FIGS. 6A and 6B, reference planes-EB, DF are parallel to plane-ef and plane-p and respectively intersect the distal or bottom most extremity of the lateral femoral condyle 430 and the medial femoral condyle 445 at respective tangent spots B, D [block 1090]. In one embodiment, in addition to being employed to identify the most distal extremities B, D and most posterior extremities A, C of the elliptical shape of the condyles, the planes-EB, DF, AE, CF may be used to define the major elliptical axes 470, 485 and minor elliptical axes 475, 490 of the elliptical shape of the condyle surfaces. These axes and points may be corresponded to similar axes and points of the implant models 34â², as described below.
As indicated in FIG. 6A, plane-AE represents the tangent of the lateral condylar curve at the most proximal point-A, and plane-EB represents the tangent of the lateral condylar curve at the most distal point-B. The respective tangent contact spots A, B of the planes-AE, EB define the major axis 470 and minor axis 475 of the lateral ellipse contour 465 [block 1095].
As indicated in FIG. 6B, plane-CF represents the tangent of the medial condylar curve at the most proximal point-C, and plane-DF represents the tangent of the medial condylar curve at the most distal point-D. The respective tangent contact spots C, D of the planes-CF, DF define the major axis 485 and minor axis 490 of the medial ellipse contour 480 [block 1100].
3. Determine Elliptical Contours for Condyles of Femur Implant and Align in an Approximate Manner Implant Condyles to Femur Model Condyles.
 FIG. 7A shows an isometric bottom view of the conventional femoral implant model 34â² depicted in FIG. 2B. As can be understood from the following discussion, the elliptical contours 505, 510 for the lateral and medial condyles 515, 520 of the femur implant model 34â² are determined (see FIG. 1K [block 177]). The lateral and medial condyles 515, 520 of the femur implant model 34â² are then aligned in an approximate or rough manner with the lateral and medial condyles 430, 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â² (see FIG. 1K [block 178]).
 FIGS. 7B and 7C are, respectively, side views of the lateral and medial sides 525, 530 of the femur implant model 34â² depicted in FIG. 7A. FIG. 7D is a flow chart illustrating the method of determining elliptical contours 505, 510 and approximately or roughly aligning the respective condyles 430, 445, 515, 520 of the restored bone model 28â² with the implant model 34â².
As indicated in FIG. 7B, the lateral femur implant condyle 515 includes an elliptical contour 505 corresponding with the outer condyle surface 535. Plane-PS is tangential to the most posterior point P on the lateral outer condyle surface 535, and plane-SQ is tangential to the most distal or bottom point Q on the lateral outer condyle surface 535 [block 1105]. Planes-PS, SQ, which may also be considered vectors or lines, intersect each other at point-S and are perpendicular to each other.
As indicated in FIG. 7C, the medial femur implant condyle 520 includes an elliptical contour 510 corresponding with the outer condyle surface 540. Plane-RT is tangential to the most posterior point R on the medial outer condyle surface 540, and plane-UT is tangential to the most distal or bottom point U on the medial outer condyle surface 540 [block 1110]. Planes-RT, UT, which may also be considered lines or vectors, intersect each other at point T and are perpendicular to each other.
As indicated in FIGS. 7B and 7C, points-P, R define the major axes 545, 550 of the respective elliptical contours 505, 510 and minor axes 555, 560 of the respective elliptical contours 505, 510 [block 1115]. Thus, planes-PS, SQ identify respectively the most posterior and distal points on the lateral outer surface 535, and planes-RT, UT identify respectively the most posterior and distal points on the medial outer surface 540. Because the major and minor axes and the most distal and posterior points on the elliptical contour of the condylar surfaces can be determined, the elliptical shape of the condylar surfaces can be measured and obtained.
In case of a femoral implant model 34â² with symmetric condyles 515, 520, both ellipse 505, 510 on the medial side 520 and lateral side 515 are the same where plane-PS equals plane-RT and plane-SQ equals plane-UT. By the application of these planes-PS, RT, SQ, UT of the femoral implant model 34â², the femoral model condyles 430, 445 can be aligned to the proximity of the corresponding femoral implant condyles 515, 520 where plane-AE is parallel to plane-PS, plane-EB is parallel to plane-SQ, plane-CF is parallel to plane-RT, and plane-DF is parallel to plane-UT [block 1120].
In one embodiment, where the trochlear groove plane is determined with respect to the restored bone model 28â², as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 5D-5G, a similar process may be employed to find the trochlear groove plane for the femoral implant model 34â². Thus, each of the bone model planes-EB and DF will be perpendicular to the bone model trochlear groove plane, and each of the implant model planes-SQ and UT will be perpendicular to the implant model trochlear groove plane. In such an embodiment, plane-AE is parallel to plane-PS, plane-EB is parallel to plane-SQ, plane-CF is parallel to plane-RT, and plane-DF is parallel to plane-UT.
The relationships between the planes-AE, EB, CF and DF of the restored bone model 28â² can be positionally correlated with the respective corresponding planes-PS, SQ, RT and UT of the femur implant model 34â² to refine the initial superimposing of the femur restored bone model 28â² over the implant model 34â² such that the condylar surfaces 465, 480 of the bone model 28â² are approximately aligned with the respective condylar surfaces 535, 540 of the implant model 34â² prior to the shape matching process described below in this detailed description.
G. Shape Matching Condylar Surfaces of Restored Bone Model To Condylar Surfaces Of Femoral Implant Model.
In one embodiment, the POP system and method, once the position of the bone model and implant model is refined as described immediately above, then employs a shape match technique to match a model 34â² of an available femoral implant to the femoral planning or restored bone model 28â². Before employing the shape match technique, it is determined if an asymmetrically modified femoral implant is selected for the POP process, or is a symmetric femoral implant is selected for the POP process (see FIG. 1K [block 179]).
1. Asymmetrically Modified Femoral Implant Model
For a discussion regarding a POP design employing an asymmetrically modified femoral implant model 34â², reference is made to FIGS. 8A-10. FIG. 8B shows a coronal view of a distal femur restored bone model 28â² having symmetrical femoral condyles 430â², 445â². The FAA 455â² extends through the center of the femur restored bone model 28â². A rotation reference line 600â² connects the lowest extremities of the two femoral condyles 430â², 445â².
 FIG. 8B depicts a joint where the size of lateral condyle 430â² is substantially equal to the size of medial condyle 445â². In this situation, the FAA 455â² is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the reference line 600â², where the offset distance tdâ² between the reference line 600â² and the lateral condyle 430â² is zero (i.e., tdâ²=0) or nearly so. The offset distance tdâ² is the difference between the medial condyle 445â² and the lateral condyle 430â² of distal femur restored bone model 28â².
 FIG. 8A shows a coronal view of a distal femur restored bone model 28â² having an asymmetrical relationship between its condyles 430, 445. The asymmetrical relationship can be the result of the femur naturally having one condyle larger than the other condyle, and depending on which condyle is larger, the knee will be varus or valgus. For example, it is common for the medial condyle 445 to be larger than the lateral condyle 430. As a result, the alignment of the rotation reference line 600â³ relative to the FAA 455 tilts from the medial condyle 445 towards the lateral condyle 430, when the rotation reference line 600â³ is not held perpendicular to the FAA 455. Where the rotation reference line 600 is held perpendicular to the FAA 455, an offset distance td is indicated, wherein the offset distance is the difference between the sizes of the medial and lateral condyles 445, 430.
As shown in FIG. 8A, with respect to FAA 455, the lateral condyle 430 is smaller than the medial condyle 445, leaving an offset distance td when reference line 600 is maintained perpendicular to the FAA 455, as opposed to tilting against the surfaces of both condyles 430, 445, as depicted by reference line 600â³. The offset distance td is the difference between the medial condyle 445 and lateral condyle 430 of the distal femur model 28â². Depending on the direction of the tilt and which condyle 430, 445 is smaller, the result is a varus deformity or a valgus deformity. The femoral condyle or offset difference td in FIG. 8A varies depending on the amount natural difference between the medial and lateral condyles 445, 430.
As can be understood from FIG. 8A and FIG. 9C, which is a flow chart depicting the method of shape fitting with an asymmetrically modified implant model 34â², where the system 4 determines the femur model 28â² has asymmetrical condyles 430, 445, the system 4 will determine the offset difference td between the condyles 430, 445 [block 1125].
 FIGS. 9A and 9B are, respectively, an isometric view of a symmetric implant model 34â² and a lateral side view of the implant model 34â² after being asymmetrically modified. As indicated in FIG. 9A, prior to being asymmetrically modified, the symmetric implant model 34â² has symmetrical lateral and medial condyles 515, 520 with articulating surfaces 535, 540 that are nearly the same size. In order to modify the symmetric implant model 34â² to fit the asymmetrical nature of bone model 28â², the lateral condylar articulating surface 535 of the symmetrical implant model 34â² is moved proximally, as indicated by arrow 605, along the FAA 455 the offset distance td measured on the femur model 34â² in FIG. 8A [block 1130].
 FIG. 10 is a coronal view of the femur model 28â² and the asymmetrical implant model 34â² aligned along the FAA 455, which serves as the reference axis for rotational and translation alignment between the femur and implant models 28â², 34â². As shown in FIG. 10, due to the asymmetric condyle configuration depicted in FIG. 8A, the femoral condyle difference td in FIGS. 8A and 9B is shown in each of the femur model 28â² and the correspondingly asymmetrically modified implant model 34â². The lowest extremity of tangent contact spots Aâ² and Bâ² are know from the tangent plane procedures described above in this Detailed Description. Also, the information pertaining to FAA and td are known from the above described procedures.
As can be understood from FIG. 10, the lowest extremity of tangent contact spots A and B for the implant model 34â² can be identified in each of the distal medial condylar articulating surface 540 and the distal lateral condylar articulating surface 535, respectively [block 1135]. The FAA and td for the implant model 34â² are determined from the bone model 28â², and the lowest extremities A and B of the implant model condylar surfaces may be measured.
Because the line-AB connecting point-A and point-B is titled relative to the reference line 600, an angle Î¸ can be obtained where Î¸=tanâ1 (td/L) and L is the distance along the reference line 600 between points A and B [block 1140]. The value for angle Î¸ can be stored in a database 15 of the system 4 and further applied to a symmetric femoral implant alignment after the shape matching technique described below with respect to FIGS. 16-19 in this Detailed Description [block 1145]. After the shape matching technique, in order to achieve accurate alignment and rotation between the femur model 28â² and a symmetric implant model 34â² representative of an actual implant provided by an implant manufacturer, the femur model 28â² of FIG. 10 will be superposed to the symmetric implant model 34â² with a rotation of angle Î¸ with respect to point B in FIG. 10 [block 1150].
2. Symmetrical Femoral Implant
For a discussion regarding a POP design employing an symmetrical femoral implant model 34â², reference is made to FIGS. 11A and 11B. FIG. 11A is a coronal view of the asymmetrical femur model 28â² and the symmetrical implant model 34â². FIG. 11B is a flow chart illustrating the method of shape fitting with the symmetrical implant model 34â².
As indicated in FIGS. 11A and 11B, the lowest extremity of tangent contact spots B and A are identified on each of the medial condyle 445 and lateral condyle 430, respectively [block 1155]. The line-MN extends across the two lowest extremity points-A, B and is presumed to be parallel to the joint line of the knee in a knee kinetics study. In one embodiment, the line 455 may represent the trochlear groove axis (plane, line or vector direction OP) reference. The line-MN may be perpendicular or generally perpendicular to the trochlear groove axis-455. Similarly, in the symmetrical femoral implant model 34â², the lowest extremity of tangent contact spots D and C can be identified in each of the distal medial condylar articulating surface 540 and the distal lateral condylar articulating surface 535, respectively [block 1160]. With reference to the trochlear groove axis 455 (i.e., plane, line or vector direction OQ), the line across points-C, D and perpendicular to reference line 455 is defined as line or plane RS. To rotationally and translationally align the femur model 28â² and the symmetric implant model 34â², place the femur model 28â² onto the symmetric implant model 34â² such that plane MN is parallel to plane RS and plane OP is parallel to plane OQ [block 1165].
3. Determining Joint Line and Adjustment to Surface Matching That Allows Surface Matching of Implant Model Condylar Surfaces to Restored Bone Model Condylar Surfaces to Restore Joint to Natural Configuration.
In order to allow an actual physical arthroplasty implant to restore the patient's knee to the knee's pre-degenerated or natural configuration with the its natural alignment and natural tensioning in the ligaments, the condylar surfaces of the actual physical implant generally replicate the condylar surfaces of the pre-degenerated joint bone. In one embodiment of the systems and methods disclosed herein, condylar surfaces of the restored bone model 28â² are surface matched to the condylar surfaces of the implant model 34â². However, because the restored bone model 28â² may be bone only and not reflect the presence of the cartilage that actually extends over the pre-degenerated condylar surfaces, the surface matching of the modeled condylar surfaces may be adjusted to account for cartilage or proper spacing between the condylar surfaces of the cooperating actual physical implants (e.g., an actual physical femoral implant and an actual physical tibia implant) used to restore the joint such that the actual physical condylar surfaces of the actual physical cooperating implants will generally contact and interact in a manner substantially similar to the way the cartilage covered condylar surfaces of the pre-degenerated femur and tibia contacted and interacted.
Thus, in one embodiment, the implant model is modified or positionally adjusted to achieve the proper spacing between the femur and tibia implants. To achieve the correct adjustment, an adjustment value tr may be determined (see FIG. 1K [block 180]). In one embodiment, the adjustment value tr that is used to adjust the surface matching may be based off of an analysis associated with cartilage thickness. In another embodiment, the adjustment value tr used to adjust the surface matching may be based off of an analysis of proper joint gap spacing. Both of the methods are discussed below in turn.
i. Determining Cartilage Thickness and Joint Line
 FIG. 12 shows the sagittal view MRI slice of the femoral condyle 615 and the proximal tibia of the knee in a MRI image slice. The distal femur 620 is surrounded by the thin black rim of cortical bone. Due to the nature of irregular bone and cartilage loss in OA patients, it can be difficult to find the proper joint line reference for the models used during the POP.
The space between the elliptical outlining 625â², 625â³ along the cortical bone represents the cartilage thickness of the femoral condyle 615. The ellipse contour of the femoral condyle 615 can be seen on the MRI slice shown in FIG. 12 and obtained by a three-point tangent contact spot (i.e., point t1, t2, t3) method. This three-point contact spot method is illustrated with respect to FIGS. 14A-14D, and its purpose is to ârestoreâ the joint line reference. In a normal, healthy knee, the bone joint surface is surrounded by a layer of cartilage. Because the cartilage is generally worn-out in OA and the level of cartilage loss varies from patient to patient, it may be difficult to accurately account for the cartilage loss in OA patients when trying to restore the joint via TKA surgery. Therefore, in one embodiment of the methodology and system disclosed herein, a minimum thickness of cartilage is obtained based on medical imaging scans (e.g., MRI, etc.) of the undamaged condyle. Based on the cartilage information, the joint line reference can be restored. For example, the joint line MN identified above may be line 630 in FIG. 13.
The system and method disclosed herein provides a POP method to substantially restore the joint line back to a ânormal or natural kneeâ status (i.e., the joint line of the knee before OA occurred) and preserves ligaments in TKA surgery (e.g., for a total knee arthroplasty implant) or partial knee arthroplasty surgery (e.g., for a uni-knee implant).
 FIG. 13 is a coronal view of a knee model in extension. As depicted in FIG. 13, there are essentially four separate ligaments that stabilize the knee joint, which are the medial collateral ligament (MCL), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The MCL and LCL lie on the sides of the joint lie and serve as stabilizers for the side-to-side stability of the knee joint. The MCL is a broader ligament, whereas the LCL is a distinct cord-like structure.
The ACL is located in the front part of the center of the joint. The ACL is a very important stabilizer of the femur on the tibia and serves to prevent the tibia from rotating and sliding forward during agility, jumping, and deceleration activities. The PCL is located directly behind the ACL and the tibia from sliding to the rear. The system and method disclosed herein provides POP that allows the preservation of the existing ligaments without ligament release during TKA surgery. Also, the POP method provides ligament balance, simplifying TKA surgery procedures and reducing pain and trauma for OA patients.
As indicated in FIG. 13, the joint line reference 630 is defined between the two femoral condyles 430, 445 and their corresponding tibia plateau regions 635, 640. Area A illustrates a portion of the lateral femoral condyle 430 and a portion of the corresponding lateral plateau 635 of tibia 205. Area 13 illustrates the area of interest showing a portion of the medial femoral condyle 445 and a portion of the corresponding medial plateau 640 of tibia 205.
 FIGS. 14A, 14B and 14D illustrate MRI segmentation slices for joint line assessment. FIG. 14C is a flow chart illustrating the method for determining cartilage thickness used to determine proper joint line. The distal femur 200 is surrounded by the thin blank rim of cortical bone 645. The cancellous bone (also called trabecular bone) 650 is an inner spongy structure. An area of cartilage loss 655 can be seen at the posterior distal femur. For OA patients, the degenerative cartilage process typically leads to an asymmetric wear pattern that results one femoral condyle with significantly less articulating cartilage than the other femoral condyle. This occurs when one femoral condyle is overloaded as compared to the other femoral condyle.
As can be understood from FIGS. 14A and 14C, the minimum cartilage thickness is observed and measured for the undamaged and damaged femoral condyle 430, 445 [block 1170]. If the greatest cartilage loss is identified on the surface of medial condyle 445, for example, then the lateral condyle 430 can be used as the cartilage thickness reference for purposes of POP. Similarly, if the greatest cartilage loss is identified on the lateral condyle 430, then the medial condyle 445 can be used as the cartilage thickness reference for purposes of POP. In other words, use the cartilage thickness measured for the least damaged condyle cartilage as the cartilage thickness reference for POP [block 1175].
As indicated in FIG. 14B, the thickness of cartilage can be analyzed in order to restore the damaged knee compartment back to its pre-OA status. In each of the MRI slices taken in regions A and B in FIG. 13, the reference lines as well as the major and minor axes 485, 490 of ellipse contours 480â², 480â³ in one femoral condyle 445 can be obtained.
As shown in FIG. 14D, for the three-point method, the tangents are drawn on the condylar curve at zero degrees and 90 degrees articular contact points. The corresponding tangent contact spots t1â² and t2â² are obtained from the tangents. The line 1450 perpendicular to the line 1455 determines the center of the ellipse curve, giving the origin of (0, 0). A third tangent contact spot t3â² can be obtained at any point along the ellipse contour between the 90 degree, t1 point and the zero degree, t2â² point. This third spot t3â² can be defined as k, where k=1 to n points.
The three-point tangent contact spot analysis may be employed to configure the size and radius of the condyle 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â². This provides the âxâ coordinate and âyâ coordinate, as the (x, y) origin (0, 0) shown in FIG. 14B. The inner ellipse model 480â² of femoral condyle shows the femoral condyle surrounded by cortical bone without the cartilage attached. The minimum cartilage thickness tmmin outside the inner ellipse contour 480â² is measured. Based on the analysis of the inner ellipse contour 480â² (i.e., the bone surface) and outer ellipse contour 480â³ (i.e., the cartilage surface) of the one non-damaged condyle of the femur restored bone model 28â², the inner ellipse contour 480â² (i.e., the bone surface) and the outer ellipse contour 480â³ (i.e., the cartilage surface) of the other condyle (i.e., the damage or deteriorated condyle) may be determined.
As can be understood from FIGS. 13 and 14B, ellipse contours 480â², 480â³ are determined in areas A and B for the condyles 430, 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â². The inner ellipse contour 480â², representing the bone-only surface, and the outer ellipse contour 480â³, representing the bone-and-cartilage surface, can be obtained. The minimum cartilage thickness tmmin is measured based on the cartilage thickness tr between the inner ellipse 480â² and outer ellipse 480â³. MRI slices of the two condyles 430, 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â² in areas A and B are taken to compare the respective ellipse contours in areas A and B. If the cartilage loss is greatest for at the medial condyle 445 in the MRI slices, the minimum thickness tmmin for the cartilage can be obtained from the lateral condyle 430. Similarly, if the lateral condyle 430 has the greatest cartilage loss, the cartilage thickness tmmin can be obtained from undamaged medial condyle 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â². The minimum cartilage can be illustrated in the formula, tmmin=MIN (ti), where i=1 to k.
ii. Determining Joint Gap
As mentioned above, in one embodiment, the adjustment value tr may be determined via a joint line gap assessment. The gap assessment may serve as a primary estimation of the gap between the distal femur and proximal tibia of the restored bone model. The gap assessment may help achieve proper ligament balancing.
In one embodiment, an appropriate ligament length and joint gap may not be known from the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ (see FIG. 2A) as the restored bone models may be oriented relative to each other in a fashion that reflects their deteriorated state. For example, as depicted in FIG. 14H, which is a coronal view of restored bone models 28â², 28â³ oriented (e.g., tilted) relative to each other in a deteriorated state orientation, the lateral side 1487 was the side of the deterioration and, as a result, has a greater joint gap between the distal femur and the proximal tibia than the medial side 1485, which was the non-deteriorated side of the joint in this example.
In one embodiment, ligament balancing may also be considered as a factor for selecting the appropriate implant size. As can be understood from FIG. 14H, because of the big joint gap in the lateral side 1487, the presumed lateral ligament length (L1+L2+L3) may not be reliable to determine proper ligament balancing. However, the undamaged side, which in FIG. 14H is the medial side 1485, may be used in some embodiments as the data reference for a ligament balancing approach. For example, the medial ligament length (M1+M2+M3) of the undamaged medial side 1485 may be the reference ligament length used for the ligament balancing approach for implant size selection.
In one embodiment of the implant size selection process, it may be assumed that the non-deteriorated side (i.e., the medial side 1485 in FIG. 14H in this example) may have the correct ligament length for proper ligament balancing, which may be the ligament length of (M1+M2+M3). When the associated ligament length (âALLâ) associated with a selected implant size equals the correct ligament length of (M1+M2+M3), then the correct ligament balance is achieved, and the appropriate implant size has been selected. However, when the ALL ends up being greater than the correct ligament length (M1+M2+M3), the implant size associated with the ALL may be incorrect and the next larger implant size may need to be selected for the design of the arthroplasty jig 2.
For a discussion regarding the gap assessment, which may also be based on ligament balance off of a non-deteriorated side of the joint, reference is made to FIGS. 14D and 14F. FIGS. 14E and 14F illustrate coronal views of the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ in their post-degeneration alignment relative to each as a result of OA or injury. As shown in FIG. 14E, the restored tibia model 28â³ is titled away from the lateral side 1487 of the knee 1486 such that the joint gap between the femoral condylar surfaces 1490 and the tibia condylar surfaces 1491 on the lateral side 1487 is greater than the joint gap on the medial side 1485.
As indicated in FIG. 14F, which illustrates the tibia in a coronal cross section, the line 1495 may be employed to restore the joint line of the knee 1486. The line 1495 may be caused to extend across each of lowest extremity points 1496, 1497 of the respective femoral lateral and medial condyles 1498, 1499. In this femur restored bone model 28â², line 1495 may be presumed to be parallel or nearly parallel to the joint line of the knee 1486.
As illustrated in FIG. 14F, the medial gap Gp2 represents the distance between the distal femoral medial condyle 1499 and the proximal tibia medial plateau 1477. The lateral gap Gp1 represents the distance between the distal femoral lateral condyle 1498 and the proximal tibia lateral plateau 1478. In this example illustrated in FIG. 14F, the lateral gap Gp1 is significantly larger than the medial gap Gp2 due to degeneration caused by injury, OA, or etc. that occurred in the lateral side 1487 of the knee 1486. It should be noted that while the bone models 28â², 28â³ have surface configurations that have been restored such that the bone models 28â², 28â³ are restored bone models 28â², 28â³, the alignment of the bone models 28â², 28â³ relative to each other for the example illustrated in FIGS. 14E and 14F depict the alignment the actual bones have relative to each other in a deteriorated state. To restore the joint line reference and maintain ligament balancing for the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL), the joint line gap Gp3 that is depicted in FIG. 14G, which is the same view as FIG. 14E, except with the joint line gap Gp3 in a restored state, may be used for the shape matching adjustment as described below. As illustrated in FIG. 14G, the lines 1495 and 1476 respectively extend across the most distal contact points 1496, 1497 of the femur condyles 1498, 1499 and the most proximal, contact points 1466, 1467 of the tibia plateau condyles 1477, 1478.
For calculation purposes, the restored joint line gap Gp3 may be which ever of Gp1 and Gp2 has the minimum value. In other words, the restored joint line gap Gp3 may be as follows: Gp3=MIN (Gp1, Gp2). For purposes of the adjustment to the shape matching, the adjustment value tr may be calculated as being half of the value for Gp3, or in other words, tr=Gp3/2. As can be understood from FIGS. 14E-14F and 14H, in this example, the non-deteriorated side 1485 has Gp2, which is the smallest joint line gap and, therefore, Gp3=Gp2 in the example depicted in FIG. 14E-14H, and tr=Gp2/2.
In one embodiment, the joint line gap assessment may be at least a part of a primary assessment of the geometry relationship between the distal femur and proximal tibia. In such an embodiment, the joint gap assessment step may occur between [block 173] and [block 174] of FIG. 1J. However, in other embodiments, the joint line gap assessment may occur at other points along the overall POP process.
4. Adjust Femoral Implant To Account for Joint Gap or Cartilage Thickness.
Once the adjustment value tr is determined based off of cartilage thickness or joint line gap Gp3, the femoral implant model 34â² can be modified or adjusted to account for cartilage thickness to restore the joint line (see FIG. 1K [block 181]. FIGS. 15A and 15B are, respectively, an isometric view and a lateral side view of the modified femoral implant model 34â².
As can be understood from FIGS. 15A and 15B, the modification of femoral implant model 34â² occurs below line KJ in FIG. 15B. The inner elliptical bone surface model 480â² and the outer elliptical cartilage surface model 480â³ in FIG. 14B can be illustrated in the each of formula (1) and formula (2), respectively:

where P=wr, q=ws, and 0<w<1, wherein when p=q the result is a circle curve and when pâ q the result is an ellipse curve. Via the adjustment value tr, a restored condylar shape may be obtained by using the ellipse model and the mathematical information described above. The outer ellipse 480â³ may be attached with the adjustment value tr, which may be representative of cartilage thickness or half of the restored joint gap Gp3, and the inner ellipse 480â² may be the bone contour without cartilage extending about the bone contour. The inner and outer ellipse 480â², 480â³ may differ in a ratio of w factor, where 0<w<1. Based on the w factor, the p radius is smaller than radius r in a ratio of w. A similar analogy applies for radius q, where q is smaller than s in a ratio of w.
As best illustrated in FIG. 15B, the femoral implant model 34â² includes an upper or distal-anterior part 670 and a lower or distal-posterior part 675 separated by the line KJ. The upper or distal-anterior part 670 of femoral implant model 34â² comprises an external anterior-distal articular surface 680 and a multi-faced interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685. The interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685 includes an anterior non-articular surface 690 and a distal-anterior non-articular surface 695.
A distal portion 696 of the distal-anterior non-articular surface 695 may be a plane generally perpendicular to a natural alignment vertically extending axis when the actual physical implant is mounted on the distal femur end as part of an arthroplasty procedure. An anterior chamfered portion 697 of the distal-anterior non-articular surface 695 may be a plane having a generally chamfered relationship to the distal portion 696.
The distal portion 696 of the distal-anterior non-articular surface 695 may abut against the first distal planar resection formed in the distal femur end during the arthroplasty procedure. The first distal planar resection may act as a guide from which other resections (e.g., the posterior and anterior chamfer resections) are referenced. The anterior chamfered portion 697 of the distal-anterior non-articular surface 695 may abut against the anterior planar resection formed in the distal femur end during the arthroplasty procedure. Thus, the interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685 is adapted to receive the anterior flange of a resected distal femur.
The lower or distal-posterior part 675 of femoral implant model 34â² includes an external posterior-distal articular surface 700 and a multi-faced interior posterior-distal non-articular surface 705. The external posterior-distal articular surface 700 includes the medial distal-posterior condylar articulating surface 540 and the lateral distal-posterior condylar articulating surface 535. The lower or distal-posterior part 675 of femoral implant model 34â² is modified to account for the adjustment value tr, which may be based on the cartilage thickness or half of the restored joint gap Gp3. In one embodiment, the adjustment value tr is applied in both a posterior-anterior direction and a distal-proximal direction to the lower or distal-posterior portion 675 of the implant model 34â².
As can be understood from FIGS. 15A and 15B, the condyle surface 535 modified to account for the damaged bone and cartilage loss is dimensioned smaller than the condyle surface 540 for the non-damaged bone by a factor w in both the distal and posterior portions, wherein w equals the adjustment thickness tr. With the study of the cartilage thickness or restored joint gap Gp3, the system 4 can provide the restoration of cartilage and therefore assess the joint line for the distal femur model 28â².
5. Shape Matching of Condyle Surfaces of Restored Femoral Bone Model to Condyle Surfaces of Femoral Implant Model.
 FIG. 16 is an isometric view of a femoral implant model 34â² being shape matched to a femur planning model 28â² (see FIG. 1K [block 182]). As shown in FIG. 16, the femur implant model 34â² is direct surface matched onto the surface of the restored femur bone model 28â² such that the articular surface profile of the femoral implant model 34â² is matched to the articular surface profile of the femoral condyles 430, 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â². The function s (x, y, z) represents the surface profiles 720, 725 for each of the exterior distal-posterior articular surfaces 700 of the lower or distal-posterior part 675 of the implant model 34â² in FIG. 15B. The function h (x, y, z) represents the articular surface profile of a femoral condyle 430, 445 of the lower or distal-posterior part of a femur restored bone model 28â² as it would be if line KJ of FIG. 15B were applied to a femur restored bone model 28â² situated similar to the implant model 34â² in FIG. 15B.
In one embodiment, the surface models 720, 725 may displace medial-lateral relative to each other, but are constrained to move with each other in all other directions. For example the surface models 720, 725 may displace closer or further apart to each other along the x-axis, but are matched to displace along the y-axis and z-axis as a set and fixed relative to each other.
The function Î¸ (x,y,z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant surface profile noise. The problem is estimating the parameters of a 3D transformation that satisfies the least squares fit surface matching of the implant condyle articular surface profile s (x, y, z) to the femoral condyle articular surface profile h (x, y, z). This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between these two surface profiles, represented by Î¸ (x,y,z)=h(x,y,z)âs(x,y,z). For greater detail regarding this operation, see the following publications, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties into this Detailed Description: D. Akca, Matching of 3D Surfaces and Their Intensities, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, 62(2007), 112-121; and Gruen A. et al., Least Squares 3D surface and Curve Matching, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing 59(2005), 151-174.
As an option to the process discussed with respect to FIGS. 15A 16, the femur implant model 34â² can be directly shape matched onto the femur restored bone model 28â² as described in the following discussion. FIGS. 17A and 17B are isometric views of an ellipsoid model 730 of a femoral condyle 430, 445 obtained through a plurality of MRI slices taken in a manner similar to the MRI slice depicted in FIG. 12 and from areas A and B in FIG. 13. Each of the femoral condyles 430, 445 in FIG. 13 consists of a series of ellipses in areas A and B. Therefore, the 3D ellipsoid model 730 of the condyles 430, 445 can be reconstructed by repetitive image analysis through a plurality of MRI slices taken through areas A and B in FIG. 13 in a manner similar to the MRI slice depicted in FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 17B, a portion 735 of the femoral condyle model 730 can be segmented and removed from the rest of the model 730.
 FIG. 18 is an isometric view depicting the 3D surface matching using the condyle models 730 of FIGS. 17A and 17B. The surface matching technique provides varus/valgus and information for the femoral implant planning design. The drilling hole of the femur implant model 34â² and the surgical cut plane SCP of the femur implant model 34â² provide the information for the IR/ER rotation. In FIG. 18, each of the ellipsoid model 735, 735â² represents the femoral condyles 430, 445 of the distal femur restored bone model 28â². The ellipsoid condylar portions 735, 735â² are each taken out from the 3D models 730, 730â². The ellipsoid equation in model 730â² can be illustrated as
        (  x - x  )  2   p 2 2   +    (  y - y  )  2   q 2 2   +    (  z - z  )  2   r 2 2    = 1.    
The ellipsoid equation in model in 730 can be illustrated as

        (  x - x  )  2   p 1 2   +    (  y - y  )  2   q 1 2   +    (  z - z  )  2   r 1 2    = 1.    
The surface models of ellipsoid condylar portions 735, 735â² can be obtained from these two ellipsoid equations. These two portions 735, 735â² correspond to the distal-posterior portions of each condyle 430, 445 of the distal femur surface model 28â². In the femur model 28â², the function f (x, y, z) represents a portion of ellipsoid surface of model portion 735, approximately describing the distal-posterior bone surface of the medial condyle 445. Similarly, the function fâ² (x, y, z) represents a portion of ellipsoid surface of model portion 735â², approximately describing the distal-posterior bone surface of the lateral condyle 430.

The function s (x, y, z) represents the surface model 725 of the medial distal-posterior exterior articular surface 700 of the lower or distal-posterior part 675 of femoral implant model 34â² in FIG. 15B. The sâ² (x, y, z) represents the surface model 720 of lateral distal-posterior exterior articular surface 700 of the lower or distal-posterior part 675 of femoral implant model 34â² in FIG. 15B.
In one embodiment, the surface models 720, 725 may displace medial-lateral relative to each other, but are constrained to move with each other in all other directions. For example the surface models 720, 725 may displace closer or further apart to each other along the x-axis, but are matched to displace along the y-axis and z-axis as a set and fixed relative to each other.
The function e(x, y, z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant surface profile noise. The parameters of a 3D transformation satisfy the least squares matching of the interior surface profile s (x, y, z) of the implant to the ellipsoid portions surface profile f (x, y, z) of the femoral condyle. Similarly, the e(x, y, z) represents the least squares matching of the interior surface profile sâ² (x, y, z) of the implant to the ellipsoid portions surface profile fâ²(x, y, z) of the femoral condyle. This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between the two surface profiles, represented by e(x,y,z)=f(x,y,z)âs(x,y,z), and eâ²(x,y,z)=fâ²(x,y,z)âsâ²(x,y,z), where J=MIN (e(x,y,z)), and Jâ²=MIN (eâ²(x,y,z)). See D. Akca (supra). The valgus/varus and IR/ER of the original joint line has now been restored.
6. Aligning with Respect to Rotation and Translation the Modified Femoral Implant Model to the Femur Model
 FIG. 19A shows the sagittal view of inaccurate rotation alignment between the anterior flange 750 of a modified femoral implant model 34â² and the anterior distal femur restored bone model 28â². FIG. 19B shows the sagittal view of correct rotation alignment between the anterior flange 750 of the modified femoral implant model 34â² and the anterior distal femur restored bone model 28â².
As previously discussed with respect to FIGS. 15A and 15B, the distal-anterior part 670 of the modified femoral implant model 34â² includes an external anterior-distal articular surface 680 and an interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685. The interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685 includes the anterior non-articular surface 690 and the distal anterior non-articular surface 695. The sizes of distal-anterior part 670 of the modified femoral implant model 34â² are selected from the femoral implants currently available from implant manufactures and according to the method discussed with respect to the bAP and bML extents of femur planning model 28â² in FIGS. 3A-3C.
As can be understood from a comparison of FIG. 19A to FIG. 19B, the distal femur restored bone model 28â² is rotated a certain number of degrees so the interior anterior-distal non-articular surface 685 can be adapted to meet the anterior cortex of distal femur restored bone model 28â², while points M and N are preserved as much as possible to minimize error. The extent to which the femur model restored bone model 28â² is rotated relative to the implant model 34â² can be understood from a comparison of the FAA 455 in FIGS. 19A and 19B.
By employing the three-point tangent contact spot method (i.e., points M, N, and any points between M and N), the minimum degree of error AÂ° is achieved. The degree of error AÂ° is based on the limitation of available sizes of commercial implants, where 0<AÂ°<20Â°. For example, some implant manufacturers only make available eight sizes of femoral implants. If the patient's femur bAP extent is greater than the iAP extent of the selected implant size, while the bML is approximately equal to iML, then applying the model 34â² of the selected implant to align with the patient's femur restored bone model 28â² will cause an error of degree AÂ° that is larger than a 20Â° rotation alignment range. In this case it is suggested to choose the next bigger size of implant to minimize the degree of error.
As can be understood from FIGS. 7A, 7B, 15B and 19B, once the distal-posterior articular surfaces 700 of the implant model 34â² are shape matched to the corresponding distal-posterior articular surfaces of the restored femur bone model 28â², the distal portion 696 of the distal-anterior non-articular surface 695 will be superposed in the femur restored bone model 28â² to indicate a location of a distal surgical cut plane or distal resection plane SCP that will correspond to a saw cut slot 123 (see FIGS. 1F and 1G) in the femur arthroplasty jig 2A that can be used to create the first distal planar resection formed in the distal femur end during the arthroplasty procedure. As the posterior-distal articular surface 700 is adjusted for the adjustment value tr for the shape matching process, the SCP ends up being located distally further by the amount of the adjustment value tr than it would otherwise be, resulting in the actual physical implant when mounted on the actual distal femur end providing articular surfaces that are positioned and oriented so as to allow the patient's knee to assume a natural or non-degenerated configuration.
The orientation and location of the implant's mounting post P (see FIG. 7B) may also be determined once the implant model 34â² and restored bone model 28â² are superposed. Also, the locations and orientations of the drill holes 124 (see FIGS. 1F and 1G) of the arthroplasty jig 2A may be determined from the implant model 34â² and restored bone model 28â² being superposed.
Once the shape match process (see FIG. 1K [block 182] and FIG. 1C [block 120]) is complete, the information regarding the locations and orientations for the saw cut slot 123 and drill holes 124 may be packaged as saw cut and drill hole data 44 (see FIG. 1E [block 125]) and the process goes forward as outlined in FIG. 1E.
H. Determining Areas of Interest A, B for Tibia Plateau Corresponding to Areas of Interest A, B for the Femoral Condyles
 FIG. 20 is a plan or top view of the plateau of the tibia restored bone model 28â³. As shown in FIG. 20, areas of interest A and B, which are similar to those depicted on the femur condyles 430, 445 in FIG. 13, are identified on the surface of lateral plateau 760 and medial plateau 765 of tibia restored bone model 28â³ (see FIG. 1J [block 183]). The surface shape of the medial plateau 765 is incongruent with the lateral plateau 760. The lateral plateau 760 shows a roughly flat surface. The medial plateau 765 shows a roughly concaved recess. The areas A and B of focus on portions of the medial and lateral plateau surfaces 765, 760. The areas A and B represent the contact areas around the joint line for articulatingly receiving the corresponding respective distal surfaces of the femoral medial and lateral condyles 445, 430 identified in FIG. 13.
I. Determining Reference Points for Tibia Plateau
As with the identification of the distal reference points at the most distal points of the femoral condyle articular surfaces, as discussed above, corresponding reference points are identified on the tibia plateaus (see FIG. 1J [block 184]). As may be understood from the following discussion, the reference points for the tibia plateaus may be located at the lowest or most distally recessed points in each respective plateau.
 FIGS. 21A-C illustrate the initial varus/valgus position of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ and the tibia implant model 34â³. FIG. 21A is a MRI image slice 16 of the medial portion 765 of the proximal tibia used to form the tibia restored bone model 28â³ and indicates the establishment of landmarks for the tibia POP design. The joint line may be assessed as described above with respect to FIGS. 12-14F. The surface contour of the medial plateau 765 is outlined along the tibia meniscus starting from a portion of the anterior medial surface to a posterior medial surface as shown in FIG. 21A. The reference spot S is selected and located approximately in the midpoint of the surface contour of the tibia medial plateau 765. The reference spot S is located within the area of interest B in FIG. 20 and may be the most distally recessed point within area B.
 FIG. 21B is a MRI image slice 16 of the lateral portion 760 of the proximal tibia used to form the tibia restored bone model 28â³. The surface contour of lateral plateau 760 is outlined along the tibia meniscus starting from a portion of the anterior lateral surface to the posterior lateral surface. The reference spot V is selected and located approximately in the midpoint of the surface contour of the tibia lateral plateau 760. The reference spot V is located within the area of interest A in FIG. 20 and may be the most distally recessed point within area A.
In each of the MRI slices 16, the landmarks as well as the origin O of the medial and lateral tibia plateaus 765, 760 for IR/ER rotation and alignment of the tibia implant model 34â³ can be obtained. A medial-lateral extending line connecting both spots S, V can be made which is parallel to the joint line or parallel to a reference Z-axis of the X-Y axis indicated in FIGS. 21A and 21B. In the slices 16 depicted in FIGS. 21A and 21B, the length of line 11 equals the length of line 12. In other words, the respective distances of each point S and V from the origin O along the y-axis are equal. This provides an âxâ coordinate and a âyâ coordinate, as the (x, y) origin O has a coordinate of (0, 0), as shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B. The plane formed by the x-axis and z-axis (i.e., the plane perpendicular to the x-y plane) is parallel to the joint line. Corresponding reference points Sâ², Vâ² are indicated on the lateral and medial plateaus 770, 775 of the implant model 34â³, which is depicted in FIG. 21C as an isometric view.
In FIG. 21C, the tangent or reference points Sâ², Vâ² represent the midpoints of the respective surfaces of the medial tibia plateau 775 and the lateral tibia plateau 770. These two points Sâ², Vâ² are located in the respective areas of interest described in FIG. 20. Also, each point Sâ², Vâ² may represent the most distally recessed point in the respective tibia plateau 775, 770. A vector direction line-212 extends across point-Sâ² in medial tibia plateau 775. A vector direction line-216 extends across point-Vâ² in the lateral tibia plateau 770. The vector-212 is parallel or generally parallel to vector-216, and is about the same height with vector-216. The line-Sâ²Vâ² extends across points-Sâ² and Vâ² and can be obtained. This line-Sâ²Vâ² is parallel or generally parallel to the joint line of the knee.
As can be understood from FIGS. 21A-21C, the midpoints S, V in the medial plateau 765 and lateral plateau 760 of tibia 205 coincide with the points Sâ², Vâ² located approximately at the centre of the medial and lateral bearing surfaces 775, 770 of the tibia implant model 34â³. As indicated in FIG. 21C, the tibia implant 34â³ includes a base member 780 for being secured to the proximal tibia 28â³. The line across the points Sâ², Vâ² of tibia implant 34â³ is parallel to the joint line and, parallel to the X-axis of the MRI slices of FIGS. 21A and 21B.
J. Determining Joint Line and Adjustment to Surface Matching That Allows Surface Matching of Implant Model Condylar Surfaces to Restored Bone Model Condylar Surfaces to Restore Joint to Natural Configuration.
In order to allow an actual physical arthroplasty implant to restore the patient's knee to the knee's pre-degenerated or natural configuration with its natural alignment and natural tensioning in the ligaments, the condylar surfaces of the actual physical implant generally replicate the condylar surfaces of the pre-degenerated joint bone. In one embodiment of the systems and methods disclosed herein, condylar surfaces of the restored bone model 28â³ are surface matched to the condylar surfaces of the implant model 34â³. However, because the restored bone model 28â³ may be bone only and not reflect the presence of the cartilage that actually extends over the pre-degenerated condylar surfaces, the surface matching of the modeled condylar surfaces may be adjusted to account for cartilage or proper spacing between the condylar surfaces of the cooperating actual physical implants (e.g., an actual physical femoral implant and an actual physical tibia implant) used to restore the joint such that the actual physical condylar surfaces of the actual physical cooperating implants will generally contact and interact in a manner substantially similar to the way the cartilage covered condylar surfaces of the pre-degenerated femur and tibia contacted and interacted.
Thus, in one embodiment, the implant model is modified or positionally adjusted to achieve the proper spacing between the femur and tibia implants. To achieve the correct adjustment, an adjustment value tr may be determined (see FIG. 1J [block 185]). In one embodiment, the adjustment value tr that is used to adjust the surface matching may be based off of an analysis associated with cartilage thickness. In another embodiment, the adjustment value tr used to adjust the surface matching may be based off of an analysis of proper joint gap spacing, as described above with respect to FIGS. 14E and 14F. Both of the methods are discussed below in turn.
i. Determining Cartilage Thickness
The wm in FIG. 21A represents the cartilage thickness of the medial tibia meniscus, and the wl in FIG. 21B represents the cartilage thickness of the lateral tibia meniscus. In one embodiment, the cartilage thicknesses wl and wm are measured for tibia meniscus for both the lateral and medial plateaus 760, 765 via the MRI slices depicted in FIGS. 21A and 21B. The measured thicknesses may be compared. If the cartilage loss is observed for the medial plateau 765, then the wlmin of lateral plateau 760 is selected as the minimum cartilage thickness. Similarly, if the lateral plateau 760 is damaged due to cartilage loss, then the wmmin of medial plateau 765 is selected as the minimum cartilage thickness. The minimum cartilage wr may be illustrated in the formula, wr=min (wm, wl). In one embodiment, for purposes of the adjustment to the tibia shape matching, the adjustment value tr may be may be equal to the minimum cartilage value wr.
ii. Determining Joint Gap
In one embodiment, the joint gap is analyzed as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 14E and 14F to determine the restored joint line gap Gp3. In one embodiment, for purposes of the adjustment to the tibia shape matching, the adjustment value tr may be calculated as being half of the value for Gp3, or in other words, tr=Gp3/2.
K. Determine Slope Vectors for Tibia Plateau
The slope vectors for the plateau of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ are determined (see FIG. 1J [block 186]), as will be discussed with respect to FIGS. 22A and 22B. The sagittal view of FIGS. 22A and 22B are, respectively, lateral and medial sagittal MRI views of the plateau of the tibia restored bone model 28â³. FIG. 22A shows the lateral tibial plateau 760 for establishing the anterior-posterior landmark references in the tibia plateau. FIG. 22B shows the medial tibial plateau 765 for establishing the anterior-posterior landmark references in the tibia plateau. The anterior-posterior references can apply to both the tibia restored bone model 28â³, as can be understood from the MRI slices of FIGS. 22A and 22B and the tibial implant model 34â³ of FIGS. 23A-23C.
As indicated in FIG. 22A, points P, Q represent the highest of the anterior and posterior portions of lateral plateau surface 760. The direction vector PQ in FIG. 22A represents the anterior-posterior slope of the lateral plateau 760 of tibia restored bone model 28â³.
As indicated in FIG. 22B, points R, S represent the highest of the anterior and posterior portions of medial plateau surface 765. The direction vector RS in FIG. 22B represents the anterior-posterior slope of the medial plateau 765 of tibia restored bone model 28â³. For these vectors, it can be said that vector PQ is equal to vector t, vector RS is equal to vector z, and vector t is parallel to vector z or substantially parallel such that the acute angle between vectors z and t is less than five degrees.
L. Determine Slope Vectors for Tibia Implant
The of slope vectors for the plateau of the tibia implant model 34â³ are determined (see FIG. 1J [block 187]), as will be discussed with respect to FIGS. 23A-23C. The same analogy described with respect to finding the slope vectors for the tibia plateaus of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ applies to the tibia implant model 34â³ of FIGS. 23A-23C. FIGS. 23A-23C are, respectively, two isometric views and a side view of the tibia implant model 34â³. Because the tibia implant model 34â³ is a symmetric design, the anterior-posterior slope in both the medial and lateral plateaus 775, 770 of the implant model 34â³ are parallel to each other. The information regarding direction vector tin the lateral side and direction vector z in the medial side of tibia restored bone model 28â³ applies to the anterior-posterior slopes of tibia implant model 34â³. In the case when vectors t and z are within a five degree difference, an average value is provided by Î±, where

 FIGS. 23A-23C depict a left knee tibia implant model 34â³. As can be understood from FIG. 23A, the plateaus 770, 775 of the tibia implant model 34â³ are symmetrical as viewed normal to the plateaus. As indicated in FIG. 23B, the lateral bearing surface 770 is quite close to being a flat surface as compared to the medial surface 775.
As shown in FIGS. 23B and 23C, the direction vector h represents the anterior-posterior slope of tibia implant model 34â³. A process similar to that employed to determine the anterior-posterior slope for the tibia restored bone model 28â³ in FIGS. 22A and 22B, wherein the tibia plateau MRI slices were used to determine direction vectors t and z, can be applied to the tibia implant model 34â³ where vector h is parallel to vector z, which is parallel to vector t. Therefore, the anterior-posterior slope information for the lateral plateau can be obtained in tibia implant model 34â³ in FIG. 23C.
The same analogy applies to the tibia implant model 34â³ of the right knee, where the implant is a symmetric design. The lateral surface profile of a right knee tibia implant is close to a flat surface. The anterior-posterior slope information for the lateral plateau of the planning model of the right knee can apply to the lateral surface profile of the tibial implant of the right knee.
M. Addressing Possible IR/ER Misalignment for the Tibial Implant
The possible IR/ER misalignment issue for the design of tibial implant model 34â³ can be assessed (see FIG. 1J [block 188]), as depicted in FIGS. 24A and 24B, which are, respectively, a plan or top view of the tibia plateau and a side medial side view of the tibia restored bone model 28â³. The medial plateau 765 of tibia restored bone model 28â³ in FIGS. 24A and 24B shows the elliptical concavity 786. The direction vector m in FIG. 24B shows a rolling or sliding movement of the medial condyle 445 of the femur restored bone model 28â². In FIG. 24A, the tangential line m along the medial plateau 765 of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ can be obtained. The elliptical shape 786 (shown in dashed lines) in the medial plateau 765 is identified, as indicated in FIG. 24A. The major axis (i.e., vector m) of the ellipse 786 provides the IR/ER alignment information to the location of tibial implant model 34â³.
The above described landmark references and the IR/ER alignment of the tibial restored bone model 28â³ provides the proximity information of the landmarks and IR/ER alignment to the tibial implant model 34â³.
N. Modifying the Tibial Implant Model to Account for the Adjustment Value tr
 FIG. 25 is an isometric view of the tibia implant model 34â³ as it is compensated to account for the adjustment value tr, which depending on the embodiment, may be a function of cartilage thickness or restored joint gap. As shown in FIG. 25, the tibia implant model 34â³ can be compensated with respect to the adjustment value tr in the medial and lateral sides 775, 770 of the articular bearing member 785 of tibial implant model 34â³ (see FIG. 1J [block 189]).
The adjustment value tr may be determined via any of the above-described embodiments. Having determined the adjustment value tr, the compensation of the tibial implant model 34â³ for the adjustment value tr can be achieved by lowering the mid-portions of each tibial plateau 770, 775 a tr distance. For example, the mid-portions of the medial side 775 will be lowered to achieve the adjustment value tr. Similarly, the mid-portions of the lateral side 770 of the articular bearing member 785 will be lowered to achieve the adjustment value tr.
O. Surface Matching for Tibia Implant
 FIG. 26 is an isometric view of the tibia implant model 34â³ being surface matched relative to the tibia restored bone model 28â³ (see FIG. 1J [block 190]). As shown in FIG. 26, direct surface matching occurs from the plateau surfaces 760, 765 of tibia bone restored bone model 28â³. The modeling of surface profiles 800, 805 of the lateral and medial plateau 770, 775 of the tibial implant model 34â³ are based from each of the portions of lateral and medial plateau 760, 765 of tibia restored bone model 28â³, respectively.
For example, based on the surface profile q (x, y, z) of the medial plateau 765 of the restored bone model 28â³, the surface profile 805 (i.e., p (x, y, z)) of medial portion 775 of the implant model 34â³ can be obtained. The function e(x, y, z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant medial surface profile noise. The problem is estimating the parameters of a 3D transformation which satisfies the least squares fit 3D surface matching of the tibial medial surface profile 805 (i.e., p (x, y, z)) of the tibial implant model 34â³ to the medial plateau surface profile q (x, y, z) of restored bone model 28â³. This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between these two surface profiles, represented by e(x,y,z)=q(x,y,z)âp(x,y,z).
The same rationale applies to the surface profile modeling of the lateral compartment 800 of implant model 34â³. Based on the surface profile qâ² (x, y, z) of lateral plateau 760 in restored bone model 28â³, the surface profile 800 (i.e., pâ² (x, y, z) of the lateral compartment 770 of the implant model 34â³ can be obtained. The eâ²(x, y, z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant medial surface profile noise. Again, the problem is estimating the parameters of a 3D transformation which satisfies the least squares fit 3D surface matching the lateral surface profile 800 (i.e., pâ² (x, y, z)) of the tibial implant model 34â³ to the lateral plateau surface profile q (x, y, z) of the tibial restored bone model 28â³. This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between these two surface profiles, represented by eâ²(x,y,z)=qâ²(x,y,z) pâ²(x,y,z). See D. Akca (supra).
Surface modeling, as described in the following discussion, can be utilized as an option to the surface matching process discussed with respect to FIG. 26. FIGS. 27A and 27B are, respectively, medial and lateral sagittal MRI views of the tibia. FIG. 28 is an isometric view of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ and tibia implant model 34â³ being used in the surface matching process.
 FIG. 27A shows the elliptical concavity outline 810 in as viewed via a medial MRI slice. Each of the medial plateau MRI slices shows an ellipse shape in Area A of FIG. 20. The major axis and radius of the ellipse can be obtained in FIGS. 24A and 24B. A 3D ellipsoid model 815 from medial tibia plateau 765 in FIG. 28 can then be reconstructed by computer software through a plurality of MRI slices similar to the MRI slice depicted in FIG. 27A.
 FIG. 27B shows the rectangle shape outline 820 in a lateral MRI slice. Each of the lateral plateau MRI slices shows a rectangle shape 820 in Area B of FIG. 20. The 3D rectangle block model 825 from the lateral tibia plateau 760 in FIG. 28 can then be reconstructed by computer software through a plurality of MRI slices similar to the MRI slice depicted in FIG. 27B.
 FIG. 28 shows a representation of 3D surface matching that can be employed with the process discussed with respect to FIGS. 27A and 27B. As described above, the ellipsoid model 815 is reconstructed from the medial plateau MRI slices. The surface profile of this ellipsoid model 815 can be represented as k(x,y,z). The medial concavity 830 matches the ellipsoid model 815.
The surface profile 805 (i.e., p(x,y,z)), representing the medial compartment 775 of the articular bearing member 785, can be obtained either through the surface profile of the ellipsoid model 815 or the medial concavity 830 of the tibial restored bone model 28â³, as shown in FIG. 28. The function e(x, y, z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant surface profile noise. The pathmeters of a 3D transformation satisfy the least squares fit 3D surface matching so as to match the surface profile 805 (i.e., p (x, y, z)) of the medial compartment 775 to the surface profile k (x, y, z) of ellipsoid model 815. This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between these two surface profiles, represented by e(x,y,z)=k(x,y,z)âp(x,y,z). See D. Akca (supra).
The rectangle block model 825 is reconstructed from the lateral plateau MRI slices. The surface profile of this rectangle block model 825 can be represented as kâ²(x,y,z). The lateral concavity 835 matches the rectangle block model 825. In one embodiment, the surface profile 800 (i.e., pâ²(x,y,z)), representing the lateral compartment 760 of the articular bearing member 785, can be obtained either through the surface profile of the rectangle block model 825 or the lateral concavity 835 of the tibial restored bone model 28â³ as shown in FIG. 28. The function eâ²(x, y, z) represents a true vector assuming that template noise is independent of the implant surface profile noise. The parameters of a 3D transformation satisfy the least squares fit 3D surface matching the surface profile 800 (i.e., pâ² (x, y, z)) of the lateral compartment 760 to the surface profile kâ² (x, y, z) of rectangle block model 825. This can be achieved by minimizing a goal function, which measures the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between these two surface profiles, represented by eâ²(x,y,z)=kâ²(x,y,z) pâ²(x,y,z). See D. Akca (supra).
P. Determining Surgical Cut Plane for Tibia
 FIG. 29A is an isometric view of the tibia restored bone model 28â³ showing the surgical cut plane SCP design. FIGS. 29B and 29C are sagittal MRI views of the surgical tibia cut plane SCP design with the PCL.
As can be understood from FIGS. 29A-29C, the surgical cut plane SCP 850 is designed in the tibial planning model of the POP procedure. During the TKA surgery, the damaged bone surface portions of the proximal tibia will be resected from the cut plane level 850 and be removed by the surgeon. As shown in FIGS. 29B and 29C, the surgical tibial cut plane 850 may be positioned above the surface where PCL is attached. Therefore, the system disclosed herein provides the maintenance of the PCL ligament during TKA surgery. In the POP planning, if the cut plane is below the surface plane of PCL, the revaluation of the tibial implant size is conducted. In such a case, a one-size smaller implant is selected for the implant model design.
In a manner similar to that depicted in FIG. 19B, when the tibia implant model 34â³, which was modified according to the adjustment value tr as indicated in FIG. 25, is shape fit to the tibia restored bone model 28â³, the surgical cut plane SCP (see FIG. 23C) ends up being located proximally further by the amount of the adjustment value tr than it would otherwise be, resulting in the actual physical implant when mounted on the actual proximal tibia end providing articular surfaces that are positioned and oriented so as to allow the patient's knee to assume a natural or non-degenerated configuration.
The orientation and location of the implant's mounting post 780 may also be determined once the implant model 34â³ and restored bone model 28â³ are superposed. Also, the locations and orientations of the drill holes 124 (see FIGS. 1H and 1I) of the arthroplasty jig 2A may be determined from the implant model 34â³ and restored bone model 28â³ being superposed.
Once the shape match process (see FIG. 1J [block 195] and FIG. 1C [block 120]) is complete, the information regarding the locations and orientations for the saw cut slot 123 and drill holes 124 may be packaged as saw cut and drill hole data 44 (see FIG. 1E [block 125]) and the process goes forward as outlined in FIG. 1E.
R. Verification of Implant Planning Models and Generation of Surgical Jigs Based of Planning Model Information
 FIGS. 30A-30C are various views of the implant models 34â², 34â³ superimposed on the bone models 28â², 28â³. FIG. 30D is a coronal view of the restored bone models 28â², 28â³.
 FIGS. 30A-30C show an embodiment of the POP system disclosed herein. The alignment of the implants models 34â², 34â³ with the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ is checked in both the anterior view (FIG. 30A) and the posterior view (not shown) and the lateral view (FIG. 30B) and the medial view (FIG. 30C).
The IR/ER rotation between the implants 34â², 34â³ and the femur and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³ is examined in both the medial view and the lateral view. For example, FIG. 30B shows the lateral view showing the IR/ER rotation between no flexion and high flexion, and FIG. 30C shows the medial view showing the IR/ER rotation between no flexion and high flexion. The stem of the tibia implant model 34â³ and the surgical cut plane SCP of the tibia implant model 34â³ provide the information for the IR/ER rotation.
 FIG. 30D shows the varus/valgus alignment of the knee model 28â², 28â³ with the absence of the implants 34â², 34â³. The gaps g1, g2 between the lowermost portions of distal femoral condyles 430, 445 and the lowermost portions of the tibia plateau 760, 765 will be measured in the femoral and tibia restored bone models 28â², 28â³. Gap g1 represents the distance between the distal lateral femoral condyle 430 and the lateral tibial plateau 760. Gap g2 represents distance between the distal medial femoral condyle 445 and the medial tibial plateau 765. In the varus/valgus rotation and alignment, g1 is substantially equal to g2, or |g1âg2|<<1 mm.
 FIG. 30D shows the knee model 28â², 28â³ that is intended to restore the patient's knee back to his pre-OA stage. The knee model 28â², 28â³ and associated implant models 34â², 34â³ developed through the above-discussed processes include dimensions, features and orientations that the system 4 depicted in FIG. 1A can utilize to generate 3D models of femur and tibia cutting jigs 2. The 3D model information regarding the cutting jigs can the be provided to a CNC machine 10 to machine the jigs 2 from a polymer or other material.
S. Mechanical Axis Alignment
While much of the preceding disclosure is provided in the context of achieving natural alignment for the patient's knee post implantation of the actual physical femur and tibia implants, it should be noted that the systems and methods disclosed herein can be readily modified to produce an arthroplasty jig 2 that would achieve a zero degree mechanical axis alignment for the patient's knee post implantation.
For example, in one embodiment, the surgeon utilizes a natural alignment femoral arthroplasty jig 2A as depicted in FIGS. 1F and 1G to complete the first distal resection in the patient's femoral condylar region. Instead of utilizing a natural alignment tibia arthroplasty jig 2B as depicted in FIGS. 1H and 1I, the surgeon instead completes the first proximal resection in the patient's tibia plateau region via free hand or a mechanical axis guide to cause the patient's tibia implant to result in a mechanical axis alignment or an alignment based off of the mechanical axis (e.g., an alignment that is approximately one to approximately three degrees varus or valgus relative to zero degree mechanical axis).
In one embodiment, as indicated in FIGS. 31A-32B, the arthroplasty jigs 2AM and 2BM may be configured to provide bone resections that lead to natural alignment, mechanical axis alignment or alignments in between the two. For example, the jigs 2AM and 2BM may have a natural alignment saw slot 123 and one or more non-natural alignment saw slots 123â², 123â³ and 123â² that may, for example, be one degree, two degrees, three degrees or some other incremental measurement away from natural alignment and towards zero degree mechanical axis alignment. The surgeon may select a two degree deviation slot 123â³ based on a physical inspection and surgical experience.
In one embodiment of the POP systems and methods disclosed herein, instead of superposing and shape matching the restored bone models 28â², 28â³ to the implant models 34â², 34â³ in a manner that results in the saw cut and drill hole data 44 that leads to the production of natural alignment arthroplasty jigs 2A, 2B, the superposing and shape matching of the bone and implant models 28, 34 may be conducted such that the resulting saw cut and drill hole data 44 leads to the production of zero degree mechanical axis alignment arthroplasty jigs or some other type of arthroplasty jig deviating in a desired manner from zero degree mechanical axis.
Thus, depending on the type of arthroplasty jig desired, the systems and methods disclosed herein may be applied to both the production of natural alignment arthroplasty jigs, zero degree mechanical axis alignment jigs, or arthroplasty jigs configured to provide a result that is somewhere between natural alignment and zero degree mechanical axis alignment.
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
