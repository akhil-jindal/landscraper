    "* What intellectual property strategy should we pursue for our technology?\n",

    "__What is a patent?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* A patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time (e.g., twenty years).\n",
    "* The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention (e.g., a patent application)\n",

    "__What a patent application looks like:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In red boxes below are the portions of the patent application that ___landscraper___ relies upon, namely:\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Assignee - who has the right to the patent\n",
    "* Publication Classification - granular classification of the patented invention\n",
    "* Abstract - 150 word (or less) description\n",
    "* Detailed description - an exhaustive description, encompassing all proposed embodiments, variations and applications\n",
    "* Claims (legal term) - describes the extent (i.e. the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent) or the protection sought in a patent application\n",
