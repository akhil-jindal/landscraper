    "It's difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists that work together and try to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?\n",
    "  * Patent\n",
    "  * Trade secret\n",
    "  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?\n",
    "  * Licensees?\n",
    "  * Competitors?\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are difficult to answer and typically require capital and time intensive resources. Furthermore, IP decision makers are required to have a strong understand the technology and the corresponding state of the art, as well as avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of ___landscraper___ is to provide a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' for a given patent application.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identification of a published patent classification corresponding to the given patent application\n",
    "* Identification of 'key players' (e.g., potential competitors and/or licensees) for the given target patent application\n",

    "## Brief Background <a name=\"background\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is a patent?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* A patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time (e.g., twenty years).\n",
    "* The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention (e.g., a patent application)\n",
    "\n",
    "__What does 'patent landscape' mean?:__\n",
    "\n",
    "A patent landscape is a snapshot of a patent situation of a specific technology, which can be used by IP decision makers to inform policy decisions, strategic research planning or technology transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is a patent publication classification?:__\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a system for examiners of patent offices or other people to categorize (code) documents, such as published patent applications, according to the technical features of their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will be focusing on a particular [Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPC)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html) class (G06, as discussed below).  Spending a couple minutes navigating through this link can give you a sense of the magnitude and granularity of patent classifications across a broad range of technical domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What a patent application looks like:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The red boxes below represent portions of the patent application that ___landscraper___ relies upon to predict the CPC parent publication classification (depicted in the top-right green box) and 'key players'.  In this context, 'key players' refers to businesses/organizations with the most \"assigned\" patents (depicted in bottom-left green box) within the identified CPC parent publication classification.\n",
