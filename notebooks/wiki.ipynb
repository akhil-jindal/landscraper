    "It's difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists that work together and try to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?\n",
    "  * Patent\n",
    "  * Trade secret\n",
    "  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?\n",
    "  * Licensors?\n",
    "  * Competitors?\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are difficult to answer and typically require capital and time intensive resources. Furthermore, IP decision makers are required to have a strong understand the technology and the corresponding state of the art, as well as avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.\n",

    "__What is a patent?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* A patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time (e.g., twenty years).\n",
    "* The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention (e.g., a patent application)\n",
    "\n",
    "__What a patent application looks like:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In red boxes below are the portions of the patent application that ___landscraper___ relies upon, namely:\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Assignee - who has the right to the patent\n",
    "* Publication classification - granular classification of the patented invention\n",
    "* Abstract - 150 word (or less) description\n",
    "* Detailed description - an exhaustive description, encompassing all proposed embodiments, variations and applications\n",
    "* Claims - a legal term that describes the extent (i.e. the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent) or the protection sought in a patent application\n",
