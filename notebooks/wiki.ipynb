    "\n",
    "It's difficult to make IP decisions for newly developed technologies, especially early on.  Currently, IP decision makers include subject matter experts (SMEs), IP attorneys, and business strategists that work together and try to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What intellectual property strategy should we consider for our technology?\n",
    "  * Patent\n",
    "  * Trade secret\n",
    "  * Other technology transfer mechanisms (e.g., publications, defensive public disclosures, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many and what kinds of 'key players' are practicing in this technology area?\n",
    "  * Licensors?\n",
    "  * Competitors?\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Can we forecast any roadblocks in securing protection and enforceability?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which aspects of our technology should we focus on for IP protection, and which require further development?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are difficult to answer and require capital and time intensive resources, an require IP decision makers to deeply understand the technology and the state of the art, and avoid analysis paralysis, emotional bias, and decision fatigue.\n",

    "## Brief Background <a name=\"background\"></a>\n",

    "__What is a patent?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* A patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time (e.g., twenty years).\n",
    "* The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention (e.g., a patent application)\n",
    "\n",
    "__What a patent application looks like:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In red boxes below are the portions of the patent application that ___landscraper___ relies upon, namely:\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Assignee - who has the right to the patent\n",
    "* Publication classification - granular classification of the patented invention\n",
    "* Abstract - 150 word (or less) description\n",
    "* Detailed description - an exhaustive description, encompassing all proposed embodiments, variations and applications\n",
    "* Claims - a legal term that describes the extent (i.e. the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent) or the protection sought in a patent application\n",

    "__What does 'patentability' mean?:__\n",
    "\n",
    "US patent laws usually require that, for an invention to be patentable, it must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Patentable subject matter (i.e., a kind of subject-matter eligible for patent protection)\n",
    "* Novel (i.e. at least some aspect of it must be new)\n",
    "* Non-obvious\n",
    "* Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "__How many and what kinds of classifications are there for 'patentable subject matter'?:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of [Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPC)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html).  I encourage you to navigate through this list to see just how granular the classifications are and to get a sense of the breadth of technologies that have been patented.\n",

    "__Goal:__\n",
    "\n",
    "A user can input a sample patent application (i.e., a target patent application) and ___landscraper___ will provide a starting point for understanding the 'patent landscape' with information such as:\n",
    "* A patent classification which corresponds to the target patent application\n",
    "* Identification of 'key players' for your target patent application\n",
    "\n",
    "__Assumptions:__\n",

    "* Limited classifications to computer technology subject matter areas.  [In the U.S., it's one of the top technology fields seeking IP protection](https://www.wipo.int/edocs/infogdocs/en/ipfactsandfigures2018/).\n",
    "  * CPC Class G06 represents a computing, counting and calculating class and coveres:\n",
    "    * simulators which are concerned with the mathematics of computing the existing or anticipated conditions within the real device or system;\n",
    "    * simulators which demonstrate, by means involving computing, the function of apparatus or of a system, if no provision exists elsewhere;\n",
